Part I

Item 1. Business

The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding company for Allstate
Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and their affiliates (collectively, including The Allstate Corporation,
"Allstate"). Allstate is engaged in the personal property and casualty insurance business and the life insurance, retirement and investment products business. It conducts its business primarily in the
United States and Canada.

The
Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Widely known through the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate®" slogan,
Allstate provides insurance products to more than 16 million households and has approximately 12,900 exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists in the United States and Canada.
Allstate is the second-largest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2002 statutory premiums earned and the nation's 13

th

-largest life insurance
business on the basis of 2002 ordinary life insurance in force and 19

th

on the basis of 2002 statutory admitted assets.

Allstate
has four business segments:

•

Allstate
Protection

•

Allstate
Financial

•

Discontinued
Lines and Coverages

•

Corporate
and Other

In
this annual report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information that has been prepared in accordance with the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") Accounting Practices and Procedure Manual. All domestic U.S. insurance companies are required to prepare statutory-basis financial statements in accordance with the
Manual. As a result, industry data is available on a widespread basis that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to publish
financial statements on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP.") We frequently use industry publications containing statutory financial information to assess our
competitive position.

GOAL

Allstate's goal is to be a leading provider of personal property and casualty insurance and personal life insurance, retirement and investment products. To
achieve this goal, we intend to become better and bigger in personal property and casualty insurance and broader in personal life insurance, retirement and investment products by focusing our
attention on the following priorities:

•

Meeting
customers needs

•

Helping
middle America achieve financial security

•

Improving
relationships with agencies

•

Deepening
our relationships with our financial partners

•

Continuing
profitable growth

•

Maintaining
our financial strength

In
pursuit of our goal, we may engage in selective business start-ups, acquisitions and alliances. However, we also intend to maintain discipline in our capital and expense
management in order to create long-term shareholder value.


ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT

Products

Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 91% of Allstate's 2003 consolidated insurance premiums. In this segment, we sell principally private passenger auto
and homeowners insurance. However, we also sell a variety of other personal property and casualty insurance products, including landlords, personal umbrella, renters, condominium, residential fire,
manufactured housing, boat owners and selected commercial property and casualty and we participate in the "involuntary" or "shared" private passenger auto insurance business in order to maintain our
licenses to do business in many states. Through Allstate Motor Club, Inc. we also provide travel plans and emergency road service.

We
evaluate the results of this segment based primarily upon underwriting results and premium growth.

Information
regarding the last three years' revenues and income from operations attributable to the Allstate Protection segment is contained in Note 18 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Note 18 also includes information regarding the last three years' identifiable assets attributable to our property-liability operations, which includes our Allstate
Protection segment and our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Note 18 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

Information
regarding the amount of premium earned for Allstate Protection segment products for the last three years is set forth in Part II,
Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, page 38, in the table regarding premiums earned by brand. That table is
incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

Risk Management, Underwriting and Pricing

Strategic Risk Management.

Strategic Risk Management (SRM) is a tier-based pricing, underwriting and marketing
program. Tier-based pricing and underwriting produces a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated solely by the pre-SRM
standard/non-standard model that we used. Our tier-based pricing and underwriting is designed to enhance Allstate's competitive position with respect to "high lifetime value"
market segments while maintaining or improving profitability. When implementing SRM, we have introduced the use of insurance scoring based on credit history, where legally permissible, to increase the
accuracy of our risk evaluation. SRM uses insurance scoring in addition to, and not instead of, other risk evaluation factors. For automobile insurance, these other factors include, to the extent
legally permissible, loss history, driving record, car year and make, and marital status. For property insurance, these other factors include, to the extent legally permissible, loss history,
condition of the property, and proximity to a fire department.

Since
we began using SRM several years ago, our use of it has been focused primarily on acquiring and retaining new business. We intend to continue to implement and refine SRM in
accordance with state regulatory processes.

We
have been separating our private passenger auto insurance into standard and non-standard categories for pricing and/or underwriting purposes. Generally, standard customers
are expected to have lower risks of loss than non-standard customers. But our rating plans for private passenger auto insurance are no longer consistently segregated into these categories.
In some states, we have implemented SRM and modified our underwriting criteria in a way that allows us to write what might be considered both standard and non-standard business with one
rating plan, which might be considered a standard rating plan designed to accommodate non-standard risks. As the implementation of SRM continues, the distinctions between standard and
non-standard may become less important in certain states, depending upon how SRM is implemented.

Lifetime Value.

We regard "lifetime value" as the discounted value of a customer's future cash flow stream. To compute a
customer's lifetime value score, we analyze characteristics about the


customer
(for example, age, marital status and driving record) and the product the customer has purchased (for example, coverages, limits, and descriptors of the asset insured) on the basis of
historic data patterns and trends. Because future loss and retention patterns of customers vary significantly, the distribution of lifetime values for a large group of customers will vary from very
negative to very positive. "High lifetime value" generally refers to customers who have above average lifetime values.

Involuntary.

The Allstate Protection segment participates in the "involuntary" or "shared" private passenger auto insurance
business. This business provides auto insurance to individuals who would otherwise be unable to obtain it due to their driving records or other factors. Like all auto insurers, Allstate is required to
write or share the cost of this business in order to maintain its licenses to do business in many states.

Retention.

As is true for the industry in general, costs attributable to our personal property and casualty products are
generally higher during the first year an insurance policy is in effect than in subsequent years. Certain costs of issuing an insurance policy, such as processing and inspection expenses generally
occur only in the first year the policy is in force. Policies that remain in force generally become more profitable over time. Accordingly, customer retention is an important factor in the segment's
profitability and a key element of our strategy in this business.

Claims

In the Allstate Protection segment we seek to efficiently pay fair and correct amounts on all claims on a timely basis. As part of this effort, we employ
strategies focused on specific segments of the claim adjustment process and we use the expertise and services provided by vendors where appropriate. We continue to research, develop and implement
strategies to improve the cost-effectiveness of our claim processes, to leverage our scale and buying power, to leverage our use of technology, to reduce operational costs, to improve
process management and to enhance service for our customers. Allstate's efficient management of the claims process helps maintain competitive and profitable insurance pricing.

Distribution

The Allstate Protection segment sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance primarily through agencies.

The
Allstate brand products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and, to a lesser extent, through independent agencies in areas not served by exclusive agencies.
However, in those states where we have implemented The Good Hands® Network, consumers can also purchase certain Allstate personal insurance products and obtain service through our Customer
Information Centers and, in many of those states, over the Internet. The Good Hands Network—a multi-access platform that integrates the local Allstate exclusive agencies, the Internet and
our Customer Information Centers—is available in 30 states and the District of Columbia to over 85% of the United States population. In some states where we have implemented The Good Hands
Network, but where customers cannot use the Internet to purchase our products, they can use it to get information and service on a limited basis.

Our
Ivantage business sells Encompass

SM

and Deerbrook® brand products through independent agencies. The Encompass brand includes standard private passenger auto
and homeowners insurance products while the Deerbrook brand includes non-standard private passenger auto insurance.

Our
broad-based network of approximately 11,200 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,800 locations in the U.S. produced approximately 79% of the Allstate Protection segment's
written premiums in 2003. The rest was generated primarily by approximately 14,200 independent agencies. We are among the four largest providers of personal property and casualty insurance products
through independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory written premium information published


by A.M.
Best and our analysis of publicly available GAAP financial statements of our principal competitors in the independent agency channel.

Geographic Markets

The principal geographic markets for our personal property and casualty products are in the United States. Through various subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell
various types of personal property and casualty insurance in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada.

The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of premiums earned for the segment for the year ended December 31, 2003. No other jurisdiction
accounted for more than five percent of the premiums earned for the Allstate Protection segment.

Our underwriting strategy for homeowners insurance is to target customers whose risk of loss provides Allstate with the best opportunity for profitable growth.
This includes managing exposure on policies in geographic areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels.

The markets for personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance are highly competitive. The following charts provide the market shares of our principal

In
the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally on the basis of the recognition of our brands, the scope of our distribution system, price, the breadth of
our product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of underwriting and pricing experience enables Allstate to use
SRM to divide the market into segments, appropriately price risks and cross sell its products within its customer base.

this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

Information
regarding premiums and contract charges for Allstate Financial segment products for the last three years is set forth in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, page 60, in the table that summarizes premiums and contract charges by product. That table is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by
reference.

Risk Management, Underwriting and Pricing

For individual life insurance policies, we use detailed and uniform underwriting policies and procedures to assess and quantify the risk of each applicant. In
some cases we require medical examinations and in some cases we may order attending physicians statements and consumer investigative reports. For supplemental accident and health insurance products,
we use a more simplified underwriting approach.

Structured
settlement annuities and immediate annuities are underwritten using recent mortality experience and an assumption of continued improvement in annuitant longevity.

Some
of our life insurance policies allow us to adjust charges and credits, generally, to reflect changes from expected mortality and expense experience or higher or lower investment
returns. However, we are subject to contractual maximum charges and minimum crediting rates and state regulatory limits on increasing charges after a policy is issued.


We
price our personal life insurance, retirement and investment products at issuance to achieve a target return on required capital based on assumptions regarding mortality, expenses,
investment return, persistency, required reserves and capital. Our assumptions are based on regular reviews of our experience in this business. Periodically, we revise in-force products
through non-guaranteed charges or credits to reflect changes in experience and to preserve the margins originally priced into the product.

For
funding agreements, our risk management strategy is based on:

•

Using
sophisticated systems and processes to project expected cash flows for assets and liabilities and to measure the sensitivity of asset and liability cash flows to
interest rate changes.

•

Managing
interest rate exposure to control the "duration match" of assets and liabilities. In other words, closely matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability
values to interest rate changes when feasible, often by using derivative financial instruments.

•

Primarily
writing contracts with predictable maturity structures and without credit event triggers, cross default acceleration clauses or premature surrender or redemption
provisions.

•

Monitoring
withdrawal activity to detect deviations from expected cash flows.

•

Establishing
multi-disciplinary working groups of professionals with expertise in investment, sales, financial and pricing management to manage risk.

Distribution

The Allstate Financial segment distributes its products through various distribution channels, as described below. This multi-channel distribution strategy
results in a broad distribution network and increases operating flexibility while allowing us to focus our marketing efforts.

Independent Agents.

Through master brokerage agencies, we use independent agents to distribute term life insurance, universal
life insurance, variable universal life insurance, fixed annuities (immediate and deferred, including indexed), variable annuities and long-term care insurance.

Allstate Exclusive Agencies.

Through Allstate agencies, we use exclusive agents and exclusive financial specialists to
increase sales of our personal life insurance, retirement and investment products. The products distributed through this channel include term life insurance, whole life insurance, universal life
insurance, variable universal life insurance, deferred fixed annuities, variable annuities, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance, cancer insurance, certificates of
deposit, money market accounts, savings accounts, checking accounts, first mortgage loans and non-proprietary mutual funds.

Broker-Dealers.

Through broker-dealers across the country, we target consumers who want assistance in investing for
retirement. The products that we distribute through broker-dealers include fixed annuities (deferred, including indexed), variable annuities and single premium variable life insurance. We have
established distribution arrangements with most national broker-dealers and regional firms and with many independent broker-dealers.

Financial Institutions.

We also use financial institutions across the country to target consumers who want assistance in
investing for retirement. The products that we distribute through financial institutions include fixed annuities (deferred, including indexed), variable annuities, single premium fixed life insurance
and single premium variable life insurance. We have established distribution arrangements with a growing number of leading financial institutions.

Direct Marketing.

In 2003, we continued to use direct marketing techniques such as telemarketing and direct mail to
distribute primarily term life insurance, accidental death insurance and hospital indemnity products. However, we intend to dispose of this distribution channel in 2004.


Workplace Marketing.

Through workplace marketing, we target employees primarily of small and medium
size firms. We examine
the benefit programs offered by these firms and recommend personal insurance products that complement and supplement their existing plans. Then we offer the recommended products to the employees on a
voluntary participation basis, with premiums paid through payroll deductions. The insurance products that we sell through workplace marketing include universal life, term life, disability income,
cancer, accident, critical illness, heart/stroke, hospital indemnity, limited benefit medical and dental insurance.

Institutional Investors—Funding Agreements.

Primarily, we sell funding agreements directly to variable interest
entities that issue medium-term notes through investment banks to investors seeking high-quality, fixed-income investments. However, we also sell funding agreements, directly
or through specialized brokers, to short-term institutional money managers seeking high-quality investments with reasonable liquidity. Approximately 84% of our funding
agreement sales are derived from transactions in which a variable interest entity purchases a funding agreement with terms similar to those of notes issued by the variable interest entity to
institutional investors. The level of funding agreement sales to variable interest entities is dependent on conditions in the capital markets. As a result, sales of funding agreements can vary widely
from one reporting period to another.

Structured Settlement Annuities.

We have relationships with several structured settlement brokers and brokerage firms across
the country. In addition, a significant number of the structured settlement annuities that we sold in 2003 originated with cases referred from claims activity in our Allstate Protection segment.

The
following table lists the Allstate Financial segment's major distribution channels with the associated primary products and targeted customers.

Geographic Markets

We sell our personal life insurance, retirement, investment, and supplemental accident and health products throughout the United States. Through subsidiary
insurance companies, we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

We
sell funding agreements in the United States and in the Cayman Islands. However, in the Cayman Islands, our distribution is generally limited to selling funding agreements to support
medium-term note programs.

The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment for the year ended
December 31, 2003, based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. Approximately 93.81% of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations generated in
Delaware represent deposits received in connection with funding agreements sold to a variable interest


entity
domiciled in Delaware. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations.

Competition

With regard to our personal life insurance, retirement, investment and supplemental accident and health insurance products, we compete principally on the basis of
the scope of our distribution systems, the breadth of our product offerings, the recognition of our brands, our financial strength and ratings, our product features and prices, and the level of
customer service that we provide. In addition, with respect to variable life and variable annuity products, we compete on the basis of the variety of
providers and choices of funds for our separate accounts and the management and performance of those funds within our separate accounts.

The
market for these products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2002, there were approximately 780 groups of life insurance companies in the
United States, most of which offered one or more products similar to the Allstate Financial segment's products. Based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments, as
of December 31, 2002, the Allstate Financial segment ranked 13th based on ordinary life insurance in force and 19

th

based on statutory admitted assets. In some states, we compete
with banks and savings and loan associations in the sale of life insurance products. In addition, because many of these products include a savings or investment component, our competition includes
securities firms, investment advisors, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Competitive pressure is growing due to several factors, including cross marketing alliances between
unaffiliated businesses, as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry.

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations. Note 18 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements contains information regarding the revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our Corporate and Other segment over the last three years.

Our
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other business in
run-off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment. Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains information
for the last three years regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our property-liability operations, which includes both our Allstate Protection segment and
our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Note 18 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.


RESERVE FOR PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE

Reserves
for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $1.73 billion, $1.67 billion and $1.67 billion at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

The
year-end 2003 gross reserves of $17.71 billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were $2.69 billion more
than the net reserve balance of $15.02 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are
reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $1.73 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting and a liability for
$0.10 billion that represents a deposit on assumed reinsurance from the acquisition of CNA's personal lines business, now called Encompass. Additional differences are caused by the reserves
of the Canadian subsidiaries for $0.81 billion, which are not included in the combined United States statutory statement.

As
the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2002 increased in 2003 by $401 million, compared to
reestimates of the gross reserves of $704 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were lower than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions on gross reserve
reestimates.

The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability insurance claims and claims
expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative
amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of
each successive year which is the result of Allstate's expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated
reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated
liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable. The Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore,
ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years.

Favorable calendar year reserve reestimates in 1994 through 2000 were the result of favorable severity trends in each of the seven years for
Allstate Protection, which more than offset adverse reestimates in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment, virtually all of which relates to 1984 and prior years. The favorable severity trend
during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity
trends, as compared to our anticipated trends. Favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs.

The
impacts of more moderate medical cost inflation have emerged over time as actual claim settlements validate its magnitude. Beginning in the early 1990s, lower medical cost inflation
rates, as evidenced by the consumer price index ("CPI") published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for medical costs, have contributed to lower actual claim settlements than prior estimates. From
1991 through 1995, the medical CPI averaged 6.3%, and from 1996 through 2000, the average declined to 3.4%. The medical CPI is considered a viable indicator of the direction of claim costs because it
is a measure of the change in various costs for medical services and supplies, including doctors' fees, emergency care, therapy and rehabilitation, and pharmaceuticals, all of which are covered claims
for insureds. In 2003, the medical CPI increased to 4.0%, and most recent economic forecasts anticipate further increases in medical inflation. If this occurs, future reserve reestimates could be
adversely impacted if actual results exceed reserve estimates.

Over
time, our loss management programs have had a mitigating effect in a variety of aspects on injury severity trends. We have been improving the claim adjudication processes by
implementing programs to accomplish better investigation of claims, consistent handling of soft tissue injury claims, more accurate valuation of damages, and more effective negotiation and defense
practices. These improvements have also involved hiring additional staff, providing increased training, creating specialized units of expert employees to handle specific types of claims, and focusing
attention and resources on handling specific types of claims such as soft tissue injury claims, claims with attorney involvement, and claims in litigation. These programs were intended to create an
improved culture, focused on expert, efficient, and effective claim process management. Since 1993, growth of Allstate's injury claim costs has compared favorably to published insurance industry
competitor results. We believe this experience is substantially due to the claim adjudication process improvements, and is an additional factor contributing to reductions in reserve estimates. While
changes to the claim settlement process have mitigated increases in severity trends on closed claims, these changes can impact historical patterns of losses, introducing a greater degree of
statistical variability in actuarial reserve estimates for the remaining outstanding claims.


In
2003 and 2002, we increased our reserve estimates for prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2003, were due to favorable Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late
reported loss development that was better than previous estimates, offset by unfavorable increases related to asbestos, and other discontinued lines. Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2002 were due
to claim severity and late reported losses for Allstate Protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses related to asbestos,
environmental, and other discontinued lines in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

In
2001, we increased our reserve estimates for prior years due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year 2000 which were reported
in the year
2001, additional incurred losses on the 1994 Northridge earthquake, adverse results of class action and other litigation, upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the
Encompass and Canadian businesses.

Expense Reserves."

REGULATION

Allstate is subject to extensive regulation. In the U.S. the method, extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in
statutes that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency and define standards of conduct. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of insurance policyholders rather
than security holders. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster
licensing, price setting, trade practices, policy forms, accounting methods, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, reserve
adequacy, insurer solvency, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, and underwriting standards. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory
financial information, see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Notes 13
and 15 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

In
recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has
been proposed. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation. We cannot predict whether any state or
federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate.

Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries.

As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own,
The Allstate Corporation relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal
and interest on debt. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding
those restrictions, see Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of
dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive.

Holding Company Regulation.

The Allstate Corporation and Allstate Insurance Company are insurance holding companies subject
to regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of Arizona, California, Florida,
Illinois, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. Generally, the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of "control" of a


domestic
insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of "control" arises
from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to, ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer or of a person that
controls a domestic insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a
non-domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre-acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the
change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non-domestic insurer if certain conditions exist,
such as undue market concentration. Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporation's common stock would generally require prior approval by the
state insurance departments in Arizona, California, Illinois, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. The prior approval of the Florida insurance department would be necessary for
the acquisition of five percent or more. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance
subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporation's common stock.

Price Regulation.

Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price
schedules, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In many cases, such price schedules, policy forms or both must be approved prior to use. While they
vary from state to state, the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same: a price cannot be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.

The
speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the pricing laws are (i) prior
approval, (ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a price before
the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a price, but the price must be filed with the
regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them.
Approximately one half of the states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of pricing laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price
subsequent to its filing.

An
insurer's ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or
proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can
manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a price that
reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts
both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.

Changes
in Allstate's claim settlement process may require Allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process. Some state insurance regulatory authorities may
not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments.

From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators and special interest groups to reduce, freeze or set prices at
levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure, particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of
catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure. We expect this kind of


pressure
to persist. In addition, our use of insurance scoring based on credit history for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators, legislators and special interest groups
in various states. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the Allstate Protection segment. We cannot predict the impact on our results of operations,
liquidity or financial position of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing.

Involuntary Markets.

As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various
states, we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities
that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of
operations.

Guaranty Funds.

Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to
prescribed limits, in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies.

Investment Regulation.

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio
diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some
instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments. As of December 31, 2003 the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries did not contain any
investments that were non-admitted for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.

Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.

Most states regulate an insurer's ability to
exit a market. For example, some states limit a private passenger auto insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more
types of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department and not disapproved on the grounds that it could lead to market disruption.
Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets.

Variable Life Insurance, Variable Annuities and Registered Fixed Annuities.

The sale of variable life insurance, variable
annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers.

Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors and Investment Companies.

The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers,
registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers and/or, in
some cases, state securities administrators.

Regulation and Legislation Affecting Consolidation in the Financial Services Industry.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
permits mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms within one holding company group. Until passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Glass Steagall Act of 1933 had limited
the ability of banks to engage in securities-related businesses and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 had restricted banks from being affiliated with insurers. With the passage of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, bank holding companies may acquire insurers and insurance holding companies may acquire banks. In addition, grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies, including our parent
company, may engage in activities that are not financial in nature. The ability of


banks
to affiliate with insurers may materially adversely affect our business by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors.

Banking.

The Allstate Corporation is a unitary thrift holding company for Allstate Bank, a federal stock savings bank and a
member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The principal supervisory authority for the thrift holding company activities and the bank is the Office of Thrift
Supervision. The bank is also subject to the authority of the FDIC and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking.

Privacy Regulation.

Federal law and the law of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and
confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to
protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal and state law also regulate disclosures of customer information. Congress, state legislatures and regulatory authorities are
expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.

Tax.

State and federal laws affect the taxation of insurance companies. Congress and various state legislatures have
occasionally considered proposals that, if enacted, could impose a greater tax burden on Allstate.

Asbestos.

Recently Congress has considered comprehensive federal legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation.
However, unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our results of operations, liquidity
or financial position of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.

Environmental.

Environmental pollution clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state
regulation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini-Superfund") govern the clean-up
and restoration of waste sites by "Potentially Responsible Parties" (PRPs). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (Environmental Clean-up Laws or ECLs) establish a mechanism to pay
for clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so and to assign liability to PRPs. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of factors. By some estimates,
there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean-up, but the exact number is unknown. The extent of clean-up necessary and the process of assigning liability
remain in dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured PRPs and insured parties'
alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether Superfund
response, investigation and clean-up costs are considered damages under the policies, trigger of coverage, applicability of several types of pollution exclusions, proper notice of claims,
whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend, appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers, and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an
"occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstate's
exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. Comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, but only modest
reform measures have been enacted.

The payment of dividends by Allstate Insurance Company to The Allstate Corporation is limited by Illinois insurance law to formula amounts based on statutory net
income and statutory surplus, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. In the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2003, Allstate Insurance Company
paid dividends of $1.18 billion. Based on the greater of 2003 statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus, the maximum amount of dividends that Allstate Insurance Company will be able to
pay without prior Illinois Department of Insurance approval at a given point in time in 2004 is $2.71 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in
time. Notification and approval of intercompany lending activities is also required by the Illinois Department of Insurance for those transactions that exceed formula amounts based on statutory
admitted assets and statutory surplus.

Effective
July 1, 2003, the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts which the Company previously consolidated, are no longer consolidated. Previously,
the trust preferred securities were reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust and the dividends reported in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations as dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust. The impact of deconsolidation was to increase long-term debt and decrease mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust by $200 million. Prior periods have not been restated to reflect this change.

OVERVIEW

The following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of The Allstate Corporation
(referred to in this document as "we", "our", "us", the "Company" or "Allstate"). It should be read in conjunction with the 5-year summary of selected financial data, consolidated
financial statements and related notes found under Part II, Item 6 and Item 8 contained herein. Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in Property-Liability
Operations (which includes the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments) and in Allstate Financial Operations (which represents the Allstate Financial segment) sections of
Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A"). The segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of
resources.

The
most important matters that we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance of our company include:

•

For
Allstate Protection: written premium growth, changes in the number of policies in force, price changes, claim frequency and severity trends, catastrophes, expenses and
underwriting results;

•

For
Allstate Financial: investment and mortality margins, the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, premiums and deposits, expenses, operating income, invested
assets and face amount of life insurance in force;

•

For
Investments: credit quality/experience, stability of long-term returns, cash flows and asset and liability duration;

•

For
financial condition: our financial strength ratings, operating leverage and debt leverage; and


•

For
product distribution: Profitably growing distribution partner relationships and Allstate agent sales of all products and services in order to meet the protection and
financial needs of our customers.

Net
income increased in 2003 over 2002 due to higher Property-Liability and Allstate Financial net income. Net income decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to lower Allstate Financial
net income, partially offset by higher Property-Liability net income. For further discussion of the results of our insurance segments, see the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial Highlights
sections of this MD&A.

2003 HIGHLIGHTS

•

Net
income increased 138.5% to $2.71 billion and net income per diluted share increased to $3.83.

•

Total
revenues reached a record $32.15 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year.

•

Property-Liability
premiums earned increased 5.6% to $24.68 billion. The combined ratio improved 4.3 points to 94.6. Catastrophe losses increased to
$1.49 billion, with an impact to the combined ratio of 6.0 points, compared to 3.1 points last year.

•

Allstate
Financial investments, including separate accounts assets, increased 15.0% due primarily to strong contractholder funds deposits and increases in separate accounts
balances resulting from improved equity market performance during the year.

•

Net
realized capital gains in 2003 compared to net realized capital losses in the prior year, an improvement of $1.12 billion.

•

Repurchased
shares of stock totaling $150 million during 2003 through the repurchase program, of which $350 million remained at December 31, 2003.
Announced an increase of $1.00 billion to this program in February 2004, to be completed by December 31, 2005.

•

Book
value per share increased 17.3% to $29.04.

•

Return
on equity improved 7.7 points to 14.2%.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have identified five accounting policies that require us to make assumptions and estimates that are significant to the consolidated financial statements. It is
reasonably likely that changes in these assumptions and estimates could occur from period to period and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A brief summary of each of
these critical accounting policies follows. For a more complete discussion of the effect of these policies on our consolidated financial statements, and the judgments and estimates relating to these
policies, see the referenced sections of the MD&A. For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.

Investment Valuation

The fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market
quotations, whereas the fair value of non-publicly traded securities is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use internally developed ratings and independent
third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. Factors used in our internally developed models, such as liquidity risk associated with privately-placed securities are difficult
to observe and to characterize. Because of this, judgment is required in developing certain of these


estimates
and, as a result, the estimated fair value of non-publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities.

Periodic
changes in fair values of investments classified as available for sale (other than those accounted for under the cost or equity method) are reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the
consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party, or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary. The assessment of other than temporary impairment of a security's fair
value is performed on a case-by-case basis considering a wide range of factors. There are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent when assessing impairments and
determining if they are other than temporary, including 1) our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value;
2) the expected recoverability of principal and interest; 3) the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed
income securities; 4) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of
rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5) the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market conditions which could affect liquidity.
Additionally, once assumptions and estimates are made, any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary, including
1) general economic conditions that are worse than assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated; 2) changes in the facts and
circumstances related to a particular issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations; and 3) changes in facts and circumstances or new information that we obtain which causes a
change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value. Changes in assumptions, facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future
periods to the extent that losses are realized. The charge to earnings, while potentially significant to net income, would not have a significant effect on shareholders' equity since the majority of
our portfolio is held at fair value and as a result, the related unrealized loss, net of tax, would already be reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity.

For
a more detailed discussion of the risks relating to changes in investment values and levels of investment impairment, and the potential causes of such changes, see Note 5 of
the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A.

Derivative Instrument Hedge Effectiveness

In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce
our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset/liability management, primarily in the Allstate Financial segment. The fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on
independent market quotations, whereas the fair value of non-exchange traded derivative contracts is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third
party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources.

When
derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value, or foreign currency cash
flow hedges. When designating a derivative as an accounting hedge, we formally document the hedging relationship, risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging
instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's
fair value attributable to the hedged risk. In the case of a cash flow hedge, this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transaction's variability in cash flows attributable to
the hedged risk. We do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, we confirm that the hedging instrument
continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk. The determination of whether a hedging instrument is effective


both
at its inception and on an on-going basis requires a significant degree of judgment. For further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of these estimates and
assumptions, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements and the Investments, Market Risk and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Cost ("DAC") Amortization

We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business. In
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position.

DAC
related to property-liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned, generally for periods of six to twelve months. The amortization methodology for DAC for
Allstate Financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates.

DAC
related to traditional life insurance and other premium paying contracts is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues
on such business. Assumptions relating to estimated premiums, investment income and realized capital gains and losses, as well as to all other aspects of DAC are determined based upon conditions as of
the date of policy issue and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected
levels, and any estimated premium deficiencies, change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization period for these contracts approximates the estimated lives
of the contracts.

DAC
related to interest-sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts is amortized in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits ("EGP") over the estimated
lives of the contracts. Generally, the amortization period ranges from 15-30 years. However, an assumption for the rate of contract surrenders is also used, which results in the
majority of the DAC being amortized over the surrender charge period. The rate of amortization during the surrender charge period is matched to the assumed pattern of EGP. EGP consists of estimates of
the following components: margins from mortality including guaranteed minimum death and income benefits; investment margin including realized capital gains and losses; and contract administration,
surrender and other contract charges, less maintenance expenses.

The
most significant assumptions involved in determining EGP are the expected separate accounts fund performance after fees, surrender rates, lapse rates, and investment and mortality
margins. Our long-term assumption of separate accounts fund performance after fees is approximately 8%, which is consistent with our pricing assumptions. Whenever actual separate accounts
fund performance, based on the two most recent years, varies from 8%, we create an estimate of performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return over that seven-year
period equals the long-term 8% assumption. This process is referred to as a "reversion to the mean" and is commonly used by the life insurance industry. Although the use of a reversion to
the mean assumption is common within the industry, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary between companies. For example, when applying this assumption we do not allow
the future rates of return after fees projected over the five-year period to exceed 12.75% or fall below 0%. Revisions to EGPs result in changes in the amounts expensed as a component of
amortization of DAC in the period in which the revision is made. This is commonly known as "DAC unlocking".

For
quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions on Allstate Financial, see the Allstate Financial Segment and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of
the MD&A.

Reserve for Property-Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense Estimation

The Property-Liability underwriting results are
significantly influenced by estimates of the reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to


settle
all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), as of the reporting date.

Allstate
Protection reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar cases, historical trends
involving claim payment patterns, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, the reserve estimates are influenced by external factors
including law changes, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements, economic conditions, and public attitudes. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by
utilizing third party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims. The
effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process.

Because
reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently
uncertain and complex process. The highest degree of uncertainty in estimating incurred losses is associated with reserves for the current accident year because the current accident year contains the
greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled, and that must be estimated as of the current reporting date. That proportion diminishes in subsequent years.

The
ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes
available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reported in property-liability insurance claims
and claims expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determinable.

We
believe our net loss reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in
conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards, for each line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils), and state, for reported losses and for losses that have occurred but have
not been reported to us yet. The aggregation of these estimates forms the reserve liability recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Based on our products and coverages,
historical experience, and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we estimate potential
variability of our Allstate Protection reserves, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be plus or minus 4.5%, or plus or minus $400 million in net income. Although
this evaluation reflects the most likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts.

Establishing
Discontinued Lines and Coverages net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than
those presented by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainties as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure,
unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage, unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits, evolving and expanding theories of
liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, the availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance, retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements, estimations
of the extent and timing of any contractual liability, and other uncertainties. There are complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those
losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different
and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to
defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured


property
damage. We believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes
in loss reserves.

Management
believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and
regulation. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be
required.

For
further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see Notes 7 and 13 of the consolidated financial
statements and the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors sections of the MD&A.

Reserve for Life-Contingent Contract Benefits Estimation

Long-term actuarial assumptions of future
investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses are used when estimating the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits. These assumptions, which for
traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage, year of issue and
policy duration. Future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the
policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields. Mortality, morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry
experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium-paying period.

further discussion of these policies see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements and the Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors section of the MD&A.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY 2003 HIGHLIGHTS

•

Premiums
written, an operating measure that is defined and reconciled to premiums earned on page 34, reached a record $25.19 billion during 2003. Compared to
last year, premiums written increased 5.3% due to increases in the Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners average premiums and the number of policies in force ("PIF"). Allstate brand standard
auto new business premiums increased 16.8% and homeowners new business premiums increased 39.4%.

•

The
continued implementation of Strategic Risk Management ("SRM"), a multi-phase strategy that integrates tier-based pricing, underwriting and marketing
decisions, resulted in a growing percentage of new business customers who are expected to provide above-average profitability over the course of their relationship with us. This improved lifetime
value is a result of better loss ratios and higher retention of these customers.

•

Underwriting
income for Property-Liability was $1.33 billion in 2003 compared to $263 million in 2002, with a combined ratio improvement of 4.3 points to 94.6.
These improvements were a result of earned premium growth, favorable claim frequency and lower prior year reserve reestimates, but were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and increased
severity of current year claims for both the Allstate brand and Ivantage.

•

As
a result of profit improvement actions, the Ivantage combined ratio improved 8.1 points in 2003 to 101.9 and the number of Ivantage standard auto and homeowners PIF
declined 9.7% and 4.5%, respectively compared to December 31, 2002.


PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONS

Overview

Our Property-Liability operations consist of two business segments: Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and
Coverages. Allstate Protection is comprised of two lines of business, the Allstate brand and Ivantage, and is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance, primarily
private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, to individuals in the United States and Canada. Discontinued Lines and Coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and
results for certain commercial and other businesses in run-off. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and
to determine the allocation of resources.

Underwriting
income, a measure that is not based on GAAP and is reconciled to net income on page 31, is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"),
amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, restructuring and related charges, and in 2001, the amortization of goodwill, as determined using GAAP. This is one of the measures we use in our
evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive
compensation. It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a
substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

December 31, are presented in the following table.

ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT

Overview and Strategy

Our goal for the Allstate Protection segment is to grow profitably and improve and sustain the
profitability of our auto and homeowners insurance products. We are seeking, through the utilization of SRM, to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide
above-average profitability over the course of their relationship with us. We continue to


enhance
technology to integrate our distribution channels, improve customer service, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting
agencies and handling claims. We have also aligned agency management compensation and the overall strategies of the Allstate brand by basing certain incentives on profitability, growth and sales of
Allstate Financial products. In 2003, we have implemented and will maintain a broader marketing approach throughout the U.S. These actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our
distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the Allstate brand's exclusive agencies and enhancing The Good Hands® Network.

The
Ivantage business sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance to individuals through independent agencies. Ivantage includes standard auto and homeowners products with the
Encompass

SM

brand name and non-standard auto products with the Deerbrook® brand name. Our strategy for Ivantage focuses on improving profitability for both
Encompass and Deerbrook, and growing in select markets, in part by using SRM. The integration of Encompass policies onto Allstate brand systems has resulted in a different counting process for
policies in force. As a result, recorded variances to prior year policies in force and average premium may be subject to some distortion until the integration is completed.

The
tier-based pricing and underwriting used in SRM produces a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by our pre-SRM
standard/non-standard model that we used and it is designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential for these customers.

Our
rating plans for private passenger auto insurance are no longer consistently segregated into standard plans and non-standard plans. In some states, we have implemented
SRM and modified our underwriting criteria in a way that allows us to write what may be considered both standard and non-standard business with one rating plan, which may also be
considered a standard rating plan designed to accommodate non-standard risks. As the implementation of SRM continues, the distinctions between standard and non-standard may
become less important in certain states, depending upon how SRM is implemented. For this reason we are shifting our managerial focus to auto, including standard auto and non-standard auto.
However, we will continue to provide results for standard and non-standard auto. Generally, standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non-standard
auto customers.

For
Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners business written under SRM, our results indicate an increase in retention and a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime
value and who
have lower loss ratios. The impact of SRM on our non-standard business has been less pronounced because the impact has been mitigated by the effect of other non-standard
business initiatives, and as described above, because the implementation of SRM has meant that in some states we write what may be considered both standard and non-standard business with
one rating plan.

Because
the implementation of SRM began in 1999 and has applied primarily to new business written since that time, today it accounts for about 35% of total premiums written. This amount
will continue to increase since over 75% of new business is written using SRM rating plans.

Another
element of our strategy for our homeowners insurance business is to target customers whose risk of loss provides the best opportunity for profitable growth, including managing
exposure on policies in areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels. Homeowners product pricing is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a
long-term period of years. Losses, including losses from catastrophic events and weather-related losses (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze events not meeting our criteria to be
declared a catastrophe), are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period. Therefore, in any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather-related losses may
contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products' pricing. Accordingly, homeowners products are more capital intensive than
other personal lines products.


Allstate
Protection's goal is to achieve pricing targets comprising a competitive combined ratio and return on equity. Our primary strategies to achieve this goal include continuing our
efforts to seek approval for rate changes for all Allstate Protection products in all jurisdictions where we believe such changes are needed and can be obtained, and to pursue other actions affecting
our profitability such as improving our underwriting and claims processes.

Premiums written,

an operating measure, is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums earned is a
GAAP measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the
unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Since the Allstate brand policy periods are typically 6 months for auto
and 12 months for homeowners, Encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically 12 months and Deerbrook auto policy periods are typically 6 months, rate changes taken
during 2003 and 2002 will generally be recognized as premiums earned over a period of 6 to 24 months. During this period, premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance
of unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The
following table shows the unearned premium balance at December 31 and the timeframe in which we expect to recognize these premiums as earned.

The increase in the Allstate brand standard auto average premium in 2003 when compared to 2002 is primarily due to higher average renewal
premiums. Higher average renewal premiums relate to rate actions taken in the current and prior year and, to a lesser degree, a normal shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos. The
increases in new business premiums, PIF and the renewal ratio in 2003 compared to 2002 are due to an improved loss ratio driving more modest need for rate increases and to the implementation of a
broader marketing approach in most of the U.S. Declines in 2002 when compared to 2001 were primarily due to administrative and risk management actions taken to improve the standard auto loss ratio.
These actions included implementing premium rate increases, down payment requirements and other underwriting changes in several large standard auto premium states.

Ivantage
standard auto premiums written increased in both 2003 and 2002 compared to the prior years due to profit improvement actions resulting in increased average premium per policy,
partially offset by fewer new and renewal policies in force. Increased average premiums per policy were related to rate actions taken during the last three years. We expect the Ivantage standard auto
PIF to continue to decline as we continue to pursue profitability actions.

Declines in Allstate brand non-standard auto new and renewal business premiums during 2003 and 2002 were primarily due to a decline in
PIF. This decline was due to increases from new business PIF being offset by the declines in PIF related to an inherently low renewal ratio in this business, and to a lesser extent to a shift in
writing business previously reported as non-standard as standard auto using SRM. The increase in average premium during both years was due primarily to higher average renewal premiums due
to rate actions.

Ivantage
non-standard renewal business premiums increased in 2003 due to the re-entry of Deerbrook in the non-standard market during 2002. Since
December 31, 2002, Deerbrook has been writing business in 19 states and consequently more stable trends in new business premiums, PIF and average premium have emerged in 2003 when compared to
the prior year.

The
trends in non-standard auto premiums are primarily due to the implementation of programs to address adverse profitability trends for both the Allstate brand and Ivantage.
These actions varied by state and included changes to premium down payment requirements, tighter underwriting requirements, rate increases and certain other administrative actions. As a result, our
competitive pricing position has declined. These trends are expected to continue, although at a lower rate, as we remain committed to profitable growth and focused on the utilization of SRM.

The Allstate brand homeowners PIF increase in 2003 compared to the decrease in 2002 is the result of the increased competitiveness of our
underwriting practices, products and rates in the homeowners market. The increases in average premium during 2003 and 2002 were primarily due to higher average renewal premiums in both years. Higher
average renewal premiums were related to rate actions taken in the current and prior year.

Increases
in Ivantage homeowners average premium were due to rate actions taken during the current and prior year. We expect Ivantage PIF to continue to decline as we continue to pursue
actions to improve profitability.

Allstate Protection generated underwriting income of $1.90 billion during 2003 compared to $497 million in 2002. The increase in underwriting income
was the result of increased premiums earned, declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency (rate of claim occurrence) and favorable prior year reserve reestimates, partially offset by increased
catastrophe losses, increased operating costs and expenses and increased current year claim severity (average cost per claim). For further discussion and quantification of the impact of reserve
estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.


Allstate
Protection generated underwriting income of $497 million during 2002 compared to an underwriting loss of $627 million in 2001. The increase in underwriting income
was the result of increased premiums earned, lower catastrophe losses and declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency, partially offset by increased current year claim severity and prior year
reserve reestimates.

Changes
in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy. We mitigate these effects through various loss
management programs. Injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. Our rate of
increase in incurred injury claim severity during 2003 was lower than the relevant medical cost indices, while during 2002 it was higher than the relevant medical cost indices. We believe our claim
settlement initiatives, such as improvements to the claim settlement process, medical management programs, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation
management and defense strategies, as well as various loss management initiatives underway, contribute positively to the mitigation of injury severity trends. However, auto injury claim severity could
offset the success of these programs as was seen in 2002; therefore, we will continue to pursue claim mitigation programs and profitability actions such as rate increases.

For
auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the Body Work price index and the Used Car price index. In
2003 and 2002, our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally higher than the
weighted index. We believe that results can be favorably impacted by the application of enhanced claim settlement practices for auto physical damage claims. Accordingly, we continue to pursue various
loss management initiatives that we expect to contribute positively to the mitigation of physical damage severity trends. However, during 2003 and 2002 the increase in auto physical damage claim
severity more than offset the success of these programs.

Changes
in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost
of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, and other economic and environmental factors. In 2003 we experienced a decline in homeowners severity
while in 2002 we experienced an increase. Additional losses in 2002 were due to an increase in the volume of mold claims in Texas totaling $326 million. We employ various loss management
programs to mitigate the effect of these factors; however, homeowners severity may increase, offsetting the success of these programs. We have also taken numerous actions that we expect to contribute
to profitable trends in the homeowners loss ratio. For example, we have implemented policy language in Texas and the majority of other states limiting payments for mold claims to $5,000 for specified
remediation of mold that results from a covered water loss.

Standard auto loss ratio

declined 4.8 points for the Allstate brand and 9.7 points for Ivantage in 2003 when compared to
2002. These declines were due to higher premiums earned, lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim
severity. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 0.5 points and the Ivantage loss ratio declined 7.3 points when compared to 2001. The declines in 2002 were due to increased
premiums earned in the Allstate brand, lower catastrophe losses and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher severity.

Non-standard auto loss ratio

declined 6.8 points for the Allstate brand and 24.3 points for Ivantage in 2003 when
compared to 2002. These declines were due to lower claim frequency, favorable reserve reestimates and higher premiums earned in Ivantage, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and higher claim
severities. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 10.6 points, while the Ivantage loss ratio increased 27.9 points. These fluctuations were due to lower claim frequency, offset by lower
premiums earned in the Allstate brand and higher losses in Ivantage.

Auto loss ratio

declined 5.0 points for the Allstate brand and 9.9 points for Ivantage in 2003 when compared to 2002. These declines were
due to higher premiums earned and lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim severity. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio
declined 2.3 points and the Ivantage loss ratio declined 5.1 points when


compared
to 2001. The declines in 2002 were due to increased premiums earned, lower catastrophe losses and lower claim frequency, partially offset by higher severity.

Homeowners loss ratio

declined 12.6 points for the Allstate brand and increased 1.6 points for Ivantage in 2003 when compared to 2002.
These fluctuations were due to higher premiums earned, lower claim frequency and lower reserve reestimates for the Allstate brand, including lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold
claims, offset by increased catastrophe losses, higher claim severity and higher reserve reestimates for Ivantage. Allstate brand incurred losses related to mold claims in Texas were negligible in
2003 compared to losses of $326 million in 2002 and $184 million in 2001. In 2002, the Allstate brand loss ratio declined 9.5 points and the Ivantage loss ratio declined 7.7 points when
compared to 2001. The declines in 2002 were due to increased premiums earned, and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased reserve reestimates related to prior years and higher
mold-related claims in the state of Texas.

For
homeowners, we implemented programs such as market or state-specific product designs, rate increases, underwriting and rating changes, discontinuation of specific coverages, specific
policy language clarifying coverage for mold claims and loss management initiatives to improve the profitability of this business. Because of the success of these programs we have returned this
business to profitability during 2003, although in the future volatility in underwriting results caused by losses from events such as catastrophes may occur. We will continue these programs and
introduce others to maintain profitability.

Expense ratio

for Allstate Protection increased in 2003 compared to 2002 after declining in 2002 from 2001 levels. The increase in 2003
was due to higher agent incentives, marketing expenditures, charitable contributions and employee-related expenses. The decline in 2002 was due to various expense management initiatives partially
offset by an increase in periodic pension costs.

The
impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio is included in the following table.

The expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximate the total Allstate Protection expense ratio of 23.9 in 2003, 23.3 in 2002
and 23.9 in 2001. The expense ratio for the non-standard auto business generally is 4 to 5 points lower than the total Allstate Protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates
and higher average premiums for non-standard auto as compared to standard auto. The Ivantage expense ratio is higher on average than the expense ratio of the Allstate brand due to higher
commission rates, integration expenses and expenditures for technology.

Allstate
Protection underwriting income was impacted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 by restructuring charges. For a more detailed discussion of these charges, see Note 12 of the
consolidated financial statements. Net income was also favorably impacted in 2003 and 2002 by adjustments for prior year tax liabilities totaling $69 million and $99 million,
respectively.

DAC

We establish a DAC asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business, principally agents'
remuneration, premium taxes, certain underwriting costs and direct mail


solicitation
expenses. For the Allstate Protection business, DAC is amortized to income consistent with the timeframes in which premiums are earned.

Catastrophe Losses

are an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance industry that have contributed, and will continue to
contribute, to potentially material year-to-year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position. We define a "catastrophe" as an event that produces
pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset,
per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including
earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hailstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, high winds and winter storms. We are also exposed to human-made catastrophic events, such as certain acts of
terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted.

We
include catastrophe losses in property-liability claims and claims expense. As a result, catastrophe losses affect both our underwriting results and loss ratios. During 2003,
catastrophe losses totaled $1.49 billion, compared to catastrophe losses of $731 million in 2002 and $894 million in 2001.

Over
time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes. Actions we
have taken to limit our exposure include restricting the amount and location of new business; limiting the availability of certain policy coverages; employing policy brokering; and increasing our
participation in catastrophe pools. However, the impact of these actions may be mitigated by the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations. We have
also requested and received rate increases and have expanded the use of hurricane, tropical cyclone and earthquake deductibles in certain regions that are subject to high levels of catastrophes.

We
consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to be major metropolitan centers near the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States, and the greatest
areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes to be California, areas surrounding the New Madrid fault system in the Midwest and faults in and surrounding Seattle, Washington and
Charleston, South Carolina. For further disclosure of our participation in the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation and the California Earthquake Authority,
which limit our exposure to catastrophes in certain areas, see Notes 9 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements.

Historical Catastrophe Experience

In the last 12 years, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our
Property-Liability loss ratio was 6.2 pts. However, this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure. Consequently, we
think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now substantially covered by the CEA, FHCF or brokered to a third party. The average annual impact of all
catastrophes, excluding losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and losses from California


earthquakes,
on our Property-Liability loss ratio was 4.0 during the last 12 years. Comparatively, the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio over the last
11 years, excluding losses from Hurricane Andrew, California earthquakes and Hawaii hurricanes during that period was 15.7 points, with an impact of 16.0 in areas bordering the eastern and gulf
coasts with hurricane exposure and an impact of 15.3 in all other areas. The question of the impact of global climate change is an on-going topic of discussion and so we continue to
evaluate credible scientific evidence regarding the potential effect of climate change on our business.

Allstate Protection Outlook

•

We
expect to see continued premium growth during 2004 as the result of increases in Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners PIF. Increased PIF is related to our pursuit
of a broader marketing approach in most of the U.S., including underwriting to additional SRM risk tiers, increased advertising and growth in the number and size of Allstate exclusive agencies.
Because of our profitable results in 2003, we expect the level of premium rate changes in 2004 will diminish.

•

We
do not expect to experience significant premium growth in Ivantage during 2004 while we continue to pursue profitability actions in this business.

•

We
expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes or claim frequency we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results.

•

We
will continue to examine our expenses for additional areas where costs may be reduced. Any reductions in costs we achieve, however, may be offset by the costs of other
new initiatives, such as increased expenditures for advertising and technology. In addition, other factors may increase our expenses, including an adverse market impact on net periodic pension cost,
increases in other benefit expenses and guaranty fund assessments.

DISCONTINUED LINES AND COVERAGES SEGMENT

Overview

The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and
results for certain commercial and other businesses in run-off. We have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy
coverage interpretation and exposure identification. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment.

Summarized
underwriting results for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table.

During 2003, the underwriting loss was primarily due to reserve increases for asbestos totaling $514 million. Our annual "ground up" review of reserves for
asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures resulted in an increase in asbestos reserves totaling $442 million. During the year, asbestos reserves were also increased
$34 million due to new information received for two manufacturing insureds in bankruptcy, and by $38 million for an excess insurance policyholder who


submitted
new and unanticipated claims that were for previously not designated, and therefore unexpected, coverage years. Reserves for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable and bad debts were
increased by $26 million. The cost of administering claims settlements totaled $23 million, $39 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

During
2002, the underwriting loss was also primarily due to our annual review of reserves for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines exposures, resulting in an increase
in reserves totaling $231 million, including increases for asbestos of $121 million, environmental of $26 million, other discontinued lines of $45 million, and costs of
administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run-off exposures of $39 million.

See
the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves discussion for a more detailed description of our reserving practices.

Discontinued Lines and Coverages Outlook

•

We
may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future. These potential losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information becoming known relating
to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative, judicial and regulatory actions. Because of our annual "ground
up" review, we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information, technology, laws and regulations.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY INVESTMENT RESULTS

Net investment income

increased 1.3% in 2003 when compared to last year, after decreasing 5.1% in 2002 when compared to 2001. In 2003, the
increase was due to higher portfolio balances resulting from positive cash flows from operations and investment activities and higher income from partnerships, mostly offset by lower portfolio yields.
In 2002, the decrease was due to lower portfolio yields and lower income from partnership interests, partially offset by higher portfolio balances due to positive cash flows from operations and
investment activities. During 2002, we sold approximately $1 billion of the Property-Liability equity securities portfolio. The proceeds of this sale were invested in fixed income securities,
which generated higher net investment income.

Investment Outlook

•

The
Property-Liability investment portfolio relies upon positive cash flows to support investment purchases. Cash flows available for investment can be impacted by
volatility in underwriting results and the level of dividends paid by Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC") to The Allstate Corporation. The amount of cash flow available to invest directly impacts the
amount of Property-Liability net investment income.

•

Allstate
expects to experience lower investment yields due, in part, to the reinvestment of proceeds from security prepayments, calls and maturities, and the investment of
cash flows from operations in securities yielding less than the average portfolio rate.

PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE RESERVES

Underwriting results of Property-Liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property-liability claims and claims expense reserves. We describe our
reserve process in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A and Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary
to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR claims, as of the reporting date.

Reserves
are established for claims as they occur for each line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle the claims. The actual loss results are compared to prior
estimates and differences are recorded as reserve reestimates. The primary actuarial technique used to estimate reserves and provide for losses is a "chain ladder" estimation process in which
historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves set by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an
estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. An accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. A report year refers to classifying claims based
on the year in which the claims are reported. Both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future.

In
the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current results to results in the prior period for each accident year. A
three-year or two-year average development factor, based on historical results, is usually multiplied by the current experience to estimate the development of losses of each
accident year from the current time period into the next time period. The development factors for the next time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining calendar years to
calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year.


Occasionally,
unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by factors such as changes in claim reporting, settlement patterns, unusually large losses, process changes, legal or regulatory changes,
and other influences. In these instances, analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors, and actuarial judgment is applied to make
appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses. Paid losses are then subtracted from estimated ultimate losses to determine the indicated reserves. The
difference between indicated reserves and recorded reserves is the amount of reserve reestimate.

Reserves
are reestimated quarterly. When new development factors are calculated from actual losses, and they differ from estimated development factors used in previous reserve estimates,
assumptions about losses and required reserves are revised based on the new development factors. Changes to reserves are recorded in the period in which development factor changes result in reserve
reestimates.

Over
one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to monitor losses for each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages
and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. Often, several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of
changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses, from which we select our best estimate for each component, occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment, as
described above. These estimates also incorporate the historical impact of inflation into reserve estimates, the implicit assumption being that a multi-year average development factor
represents an adequate provision. Based on our review of these estimates, our best estimate of required reserves for each state/line/coverage component is recorded for each accident year, and the
required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The
facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a
reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates. At
December 31, 2003, the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase in net reserves would be a decrease of approximately $100 million in net income. A reserve
reestimation resulting in a one percent decrease in net reserves would increase net income by approximately $100 million. For a further description of our reserving policies and the potential
variability in our reserve estimates, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A.

For
Allstate Protection, at each reporting date the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the
most recent preceding accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because, at the end of the current accident year, the percentage of losses that have not
been reported or settled and that consequently must be estimated, is higher than it will be as time elapses. Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and to medical care for
injuries from accidents. During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end
of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. Consequently, this is the point in
time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. After the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more
difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical
annual percentage payout of reserves (estimated losses) for an accident year is approximately 46% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the second year, 14% in the third year,
9% in the fourth year, and the remaining 11% thereafter.

Auto reserve reestimates in 2003 were primarily the result of 2002 auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than expected. Auto
reserve reestimates in 2002 were primarily due to increasing severity trends for automobile repair and medical costs of $55 million for Ivantage operations and $17 million for Canadian
operations, partially offset by reduced reserve


reestimates
for the Allstate brand. In 2001, the favorable impact of Allstate brand auto reserve reestimates was partially offset by a greater than expected volume of late-reported,
unusual, weather-related losses; adverse results of litigation; and increased reestimates of losses reported in prior years for the Ivantage and Canadian businesses.

Homeowners
reserve reestimates in 2003 were primarily due to severity development that was greater than expected and additional losses from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, partially
offset by the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold claims.

Homeowners
reserve reestimates in 2002 were primarily due to claim severity and late reported losses that were greater than the level anticipated in previous reserve estimates. This
resulted in reserve reestimates including $78 million related to IBNR, $95 million related to claim severity and $169 million related to mold claims in Texas. In addition,
reserves were increased $25 million for settlement of losses remaining from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. In March 2002, a new Texas homeowner policy form was implemented that
restricted mold coverage from what had been provided by a previous broad state-mandated policy form. As a result, coverage provided and the incidence of losses for mold diminished in the second half
of the year. Reserve reestimates in 2003 and 2002 for the 1994 Northridge earthquake losses were to provide for higher than anticipated losses resulting from settlement of class action litigation and
due to greater than expected additional losses and expenses caused by coverage afforded due to the passage of California's Senate Bill 1899 in 1999.

Increased
homeowner reserve reestimates in 2001 were primarily due to $118 million of greater late reported unusual weather-related losses than expected from the end of the year
2000 which was reported in the year 2001, increases to severity of homeowners losses reported in prior years totaling $172 million, and $125 million for settlement of losses remaining
from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Reserve reestimates in 2001 for the 1994 Northridge earthquake losses were to provide for higher than anticipated losses resulting from settlement of class action
litigation and due to greater than expected additional losses and expenses caused by coverage afforded due to the passage of California's Senate Bill 1899 in 1999.

Other
lines reserve reestimates in 2003, 2002, and 2001 were primarily the result of different claim severity development than anticipated in previous estimates.

Allstate brand

The Allstate brand experienced $209 million of favorable prior year reserve reestimates in 2003. This
was primarily due to auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than expected and the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in Texas related to mold
claims.

The
Allstate brand experienced $386 million of unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates in 2002. This was primarily due to $338 million of homeowners reestimates
resulting from claim severity development and late reported losses that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates, including $169 million related to mold claims in
Texas and $25 million for settlement of losses remaining from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Reestimates of reserves from prior years for auto and other businesses were about
$48 million for the year, of which $20 million was for Canadian business reserves. These reestimates were primarily due to increasing inflationary pressures on auto severities and for
some of the small non-auto products.

Reserve
reestimates for the Allstate brand claims in 2001 included a $348 million increase in the 2000 accident year losses offset by $122 million of net favorable
reestimates for all prior years. Approximately $197 million of unfavorable reestimates for 2000 accident year losses was the result of unusually bad weather experienced at year-end
2000, coupled with an unanticipated number of late reported claims. The remainder of the 2000 accident year loss reestimate was primarily attributable to increased severity for homeowner losses
including mold-related losses in Texas. For accident years prior to 2000, the net reestimate of $122 million included $125 million of adverse reestimates for
Northridge-related losses and $105 million of other litigation-related adverse reestimates, offset by favorable reestimates.

The
preceding trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors, as previously described, used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a
reporting period until all claims have been paid. Because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates, reserves
are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends, based on the indications of updated development factor calculations.


The
impact of these reestimates on the Allstate brand underwriting income (loss) is shown in the table below.

Discontinued Lines and Coverages

We conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish
asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines reserves. Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and
assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive "ground up" methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g.
claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders.

Reserve
reestimates for the Discontinued Lines and Coverages, as shown in the table below, were increased primarily for asbestos in 2003 and 2001, and for asbestos, environmental and
other discontinued lines losses in 2002.

Reserve additions for asbestos in 2003, totaling $520 million, were primarily for products-related coverage. This increase essentially was a result of more
claimants being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims and new claims being reported in our assumed reinsurance business. This trend is consistent with the trends of
other carriers in the industry. We believe it is related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage, ongoing litigation, potential congressional activity and bankruptcy actions. During 2003,
reserve reestimates included $29 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run-off, and $23 million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and
miscellaneous run-off exposures.


In
2002, asbestos reserves were increased by $121 million primarily due to final settlement of exposure to an insured and adverse reestimates on other estimated asbestos losses
due to an increase in claims from smaller more peripheral exposures. Pending asbestos claims related to excess policies issued to manufacturers that have filed for bankruptcy protection also increased
to a minor extent. Reserve reestimates also included $45 million for other discontinued lines exposures in run-off and $39 million related to the cost of administering claim
settlements and miscellaneous run-off exposures.

In
2001, our annual review resulted in a $94 million reestimate of asbestos reserves due to increased emergence of reported losses. This was partially offset by a
$45 million favorable reestimate of environmental reserves and $23 million of favorable reestimates in other discontinued lines due to improving loss emergence trends in these areas.

Our
exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the
mid-1980s, including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large United States companies, and from direct excess insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial
excess general liability coverages on Fortune 500 companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. Other
discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products.

In
1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property-liability industry was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion," which excluded coverage
for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987
contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual
aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks.

Our
exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct
excess insurance, or direct primary commercial insurance. The direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially "excess" in
nature.

Direct
excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. The nature of excess coverage and
reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention or primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by
the significant reinsurance that we have purchased on our excess business.

Our
assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers' reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion
of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. The majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15%
is for pro-rata coverage.

Liability
for actual and potential asbestos losses has caused a number of companies to file for bankruptcy protection. Of 63 companies that filed for bankruptcy as a result of
significant asbestos exposure, on a direct (both primary and excess) insurance basis, we:

•

Did
not insure 43

•

Settled
with 12

•

Reserved
to excess insurance policy limits on 4

•

Reserved
to maximum mutual agreed upon exposure on 1


•

Appropriately
reserved for the remaining 3

Although
we do not believe a greater exposure is probable for the remaining 3, our maximum additional exposure to full policy limits for the remaining 3 in the aggregate is
$27 million, after-tax.

Reserves
related to asbestos manufacturers in bankruptcy, whose claims are still in the process of resolution, are established based on claims that have occurred and other related
information. The claim resolution process in these bankruptcies is lengthy and involves, among other factors, filing notices of claim by all current claimants, evaluating pre-petition and
post-petition claims, negotiations among the various creditor groups and the debtors and, if necessary, evidentiary hearings by the bankruptcy court. We will continue to monitor the
relevant bankruptcies.

Our
exposure, if any, to bankruptcies of major asbestos manufacturers, including any currently in bankruptcy, would also arise if assumed reinsurance was written for an insurer providing
insurance protection to a major asbestos manufacturer, and then only in proportion to our participation share. We assess our potential liability to each of our reinsurance programs and adjust reserves
accordingly based on our knowledge of the losses of each reinsured exposure.

Our
direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. This business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many
diverse business sectors located throughout the country.

The survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. This is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to
measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount
of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to
vary over time.

In
2003, the asbestos survival ratios increased (improved) due to higher reserve balances and relatively low payments. The environmental survival ratios decreased slightly due to a lower
reserve balance. In 2002, both the asbestos and environmental survival ratios declined due to an increase in claims paid and reduced reserve levels, primarily due to commutations, policy
buy-backs, and settlement agreements that, in turn, caused increased claim payments and reduced reserve levels. The total commutations, policy buy-backs, and settlement
agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for 2003, 2002 and 2001 excluding these commutations, policy buy-backs, and settlement agreements, are represented
in the following table.

Our three-year net average survival ratio excluding commutations, policy buy-backs, and settlement agreements is viewed to be a more
representative, prospective measure of current reserve adequacy than other survival ratio calculations. Now at 22.2 years for asbestos as of December 31, 2003, we consider it to
represent a strong reserve position. A one-year increase in the three-year average asbestos survival ratio at December 31, 2003 would require an after-tax
increase in reserves of approximately $31 million.

To
conform to the current year presentation, $8 million of asbestos reserves at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 have been reclassified from direct excess
insurance policyholders to direct primary insurance policyholders.

(2)

Excludes
a $6 million increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables.

During the last three years, 190 direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims, and 104 policyholders were closed, increasing the
number of active policyholders by 86 during the period. The 86 increase comprised 58 from 2003, 18 from 2002 and 10 from 2001. The increase of 58 from 2003 included 85 new policyholders reporting new
claims and 27 policyholders' claims were closed. Reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended December 31, 2003, totaled $514 million and included the following factors:

•

Direct
primary insurance net reserves increased by $12 million. We were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos
manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis.

•

Direct
excess insurance net reserves increased by $114 million for policyholders with existing active claims. The increase in existing active claims was attributable
to an increase in the number of claims filed against direct excess insureds.

•

Assumed
reinsurance net reserves increased by $18 million for increased cessions as ceding companies (other insurance carriers) also experienced increased claim
activity. Many of the insureds that reported claims to us on their direct excess insurance coverages also reported claims to carriers included in our assumed reinsurance exposure. The number of
reported new claims is shown in the following table.

New
claims are defined as the aggregate number of policyholders with claims reported by all ceding companies.

•

IBNR
net reserves increased by $300 million in anticipation of continued claims activity. At December 31, 2003 IBNR represented 61.1% of total asbestos
reserves, 4 points higher than at December 31, 2002. IBNR reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of
additional unknown claims from current and new direct active insurance policyholders and ceding companies.


Our
non-products case reserves represent approximately 4.7% of total asbestos case reserves. We do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds'
retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded. We did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant
non-products-related loss exposure.

For
environmental exposures a comprehensive "ground up" review, using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review, is also conducted in the third quarter of each year. The
analysis performed in 2003 produced essentially no change in reserve estimates. Environmental loss emergence in 2002 was primarily due to losses from one large reinsurance contract and a few other
direct losses. In past years environmental reestimates have been favorable.

Our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial
decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be
enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost-efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We are unable to determine the effect,
if any, that such legislation will have on results of operations or financial position.

Reserves

Other mass torts describes excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental. Workers'
compensation and commercial and other include run-off from discontinued primary, excess and reinsurance commercial


insurance
operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental. Reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described, as they relate to the
characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures.

We
believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability,
jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Another comprehensive
"ground up" review will be completed in the third quarter of 2004, as well as assessments each quarter to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require an interim adjustment
to reserves.

Property-Liability Reinsurance Ceded

We participate in various reinsurance mechanisms, including both voluntary and mandatory
industry pools and facilities, and have purchased reinsurance to mitigate long-tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures. We retain
primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers.

The
impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at December 31 are summarized in the following table, net of allowances we have established for
uncollectible amounts.

We purchase reinsurance after evaluating the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of coverage. Estimating amounts of reinsurance
recoverables is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of loss reserves. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves
continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable, and a provision for
uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $101 million and $85 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Adverse
developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and
future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. Recently there has also been consolidation activity between some of our carriers and potential carriers in the industry, which causes
reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. In addition, over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos, environmental, and other
discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, that
these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future.

ten largest reinsurance recoverable balances are shown in the following table at December 31, net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts.

ALLSTATE FINANCIAL 2003 HIGHLIGHTS

•

Allstate
Financial revenues increased 9.4% in 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was primarily due to lower net capital losses in 2003. Excluding net capital losses,
revenues increased 2.3% in 2003 to $5.54 billion primarily due to increased net investment income.

•

Net
income increased to $305 million in 2003 from a net loss of $22 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to the 2002 impact of the change in
accounting principle for goodwill that resulted in a charge of $283 million, after-tax, and lower net realized capital losses in 2003, partly offset by higher income tax expense and
an increased loss on disposition of operations.

•

Investments,
including separate accounts assets, increased 15.0% to $76.32 billion due primarily to strong contractholder funds deposits and increases in separate
accounts balances resulting from improved equity market performance during the year.

•

Contractholder
funds deposits totaled $10.63 billion for 2003 compared to $9.52 billion in 2002. The increase of $1.11 billion was primarily
attributable to fixed annuity and institutional product deposits.

Life and annuity premiums and contract charges

Premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life, immediate
annuities with life contingencies and other insurance products that have significant mortality or morbidity risk. Contract charges are revenues generated from interest-sensitive
life products, variable annuities, fixed annuities and other investment products for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities. Contract charges are
assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance, administration, cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates. As a result, changes in contractholder funds
and separate accounts liabilities are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues.

Total premiums decreased 0.4% in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease was primarily the result of the discontinuance of our direct response
business, lower traditional life and immediate annuity premium, partially offset by higher premiums from accident, health and other products sold through the workplace. The decline in premiums from
our direct response business reflects management actions over the past two years to discontinue this business. The decline in traditional life premium reflects a shift in product sales from
traditional whole life policies to term insurance, which has lower premiums


and
where we utilize more ceded reinsurance. The decline in immediate annuities with life contingencies was a result of underwriting actions to reduce the size of certain types of individual contracts
sold in 2003.

Total
premiums were $1.37 billion in 2002 compared to $1.35 billion in 2001. The increase was due to increases in immediate annuities with life contingencies, partially
offset by declines in traditional life, accident, health and other insurance products. The decline in traditional life premiums was primarily related to the implementation of a reinsurance agreement
on January 1, 2002 that ceded our direct response credit life insurance products and, to a lesser extent, a shift in product sales from traditional whole life insurance to term.

Contract
charges increased 1.8% to $939 million in 2003 compared to $922 million in 2002. Contract charges were consistent with the prior year as higher interest-sensitive
life contract charges resulting from in-force business growth were partially offset by lower variable annuity contract charges, which resulted from lower average variable annuity account
balances during the period. Variable annuity contract charges, as a percent of average separate account values, increased to 166 basis points in 2003 from 163 basis points in 2002 as a result of
increases in benefit rider fee rates and utilization by contractholders.

Contract
charges increased 4.2% in 2002 compared to 2001 as contract charges on new sales of interest-sensitive life products more than offset a decline from variable annuities. Variable
annuity contract charges declined due to lower average account values during 2002 as poor equity market performance more than offset growth from deposits during the year.

Contractholder
funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual products, such as interest-sensitive life, fixed annuities, net bank deposits and
institutional products, such as funding agreements. The balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative
contract maturities, benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses.

Contractholder funds deposits increased 11.7% in 2003 compared to 2002, and average contractholder funds increased 18.2% in 2003 compared to 2002, due to significant increases in
institutional product and fixed annuity deposits. Fixed annuity deposits increased 5.9% over 2002 due to competitive pricing and our decision to maintain a market presence despite a challenging
interest rate environment. Fixed annuity deposits through our financial institutions distribution channel grew 40.0% in 2003 compared to 2002. This growth was a result of expanded relationships and
consumers' attraction to fixed rate contracts with shorter term rate guarantees due to volatile equity markets and the uncertainty of a low interest rate environment. This growth was partially offset
by a decline in fixed annuities sold through our independent agencies distribution channel where longer term interest rate guarantees are generally favored. As a result of the low interest rate
environment during 2003, we introduced fixed annuity contracts with lower guaranteed crediting rates. Institutional products deposits increased 44.8% largely due to our assessment of market
opportunities.

Benefits
and withdrawals increased $711 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Benefits and withdrawals for 2003 represent 7.9% of the beginning of period contractholder funds balance,
a slight increase compared to 7.5% in 2002. The increase reflects the aging of our in-force contracts as the actual surrenders and withdrawals compared favorably to our expectations.
Institutional product maturities increased $1.11 billion in 2003 as an increasing number of contracts issued in prior years reached their stated maturity dates. $1.91 billion is
scheduled to mature in 2004.

Contractholder
funds deposits increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to significant increases in fixed annuity deposits and bank and other deposits, partially offset by a decline in
institutional products. Fixed annuity deposits increased 57.3% over 2001 due to competitive pricing and the introduction of the Allstate® Treasury-Linked Annuity, which generated
$761 million of deposits in 2002. Institutional deposits decreased 30.4% in 2002, as market conditions at times during the year would not allow us to achieve acceptable pricing returns. Average
contractholder funds increased 19.0% in 2002 compared to 2001.

Separate
accounts liabilities represent contractholders' claims to the related legally segregated separate accounts assets. Separate accounts liabilities primarily arise from the sale of
variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. The following table shows the changes in separate accounts liabilities.

Separate accounts liabilities increased $2.30 billion during 2003 compared to 2002 reflecting a significant improvement in investment results and net
deposits. The increase in variable annuity net deposits resulted from the increasing attractiveness of the separate accounts equity investment funds following improved equity market performance and
the introduction of the Allstate® Advisor variable annuity product. Allstate Advisor is a multi-manager variable annuity that offers funds from four mutual fund families. In volatile and
uncertain equity markets, variable annuity contractholders often allocate a significant portion of their initial variable annuity contract deposit into a fixed rate


investment
option. This allows contractholders to transfer funds to separate accounts equity investment funds over time and to purchase their equity investment fund shares at multiple fund price
levels. This is commonly referred to as dollar cost averaging. The level of this activity is reflected above in the deposits allocated to the fixed accounts, while all other transfer activity between
the fixed and separate accounts investment options is reflected in net transfers from fixed accounts. The liability for the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts is reflected in contractholder
funds.

Separate
accounts liabilities decreased $2.46 billion during 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting the significant decline in equity markets and the resulting substantial decrease in
variable annuity net deposits during the year.

Net investment income

increased 3.6% in 2003 compared to 2002 and 5.4% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increases were due to higher
portfolio balances during the year as investment income on positive cash flows from product sales and deposits was mostly offset by lower portfolio yields. Investment balances as of
December 31, 2003, excluding unrealized net capital gains, increased 14.5% from December 31, 2002 and increased 17.1% as of December 31, 2002 compared to December 31, 2001.
The lower portfolio yields were primarily due to purchases of fixed income securities with yields lower than the current portfolio average.

During
2003 we reclassified periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments used for economic hedging purposes but categorized as "non-hedge" for accounting
purposes, to realized capital gains and losses so that they are reported consistently with the corresponding fair value adjustments on these instruments. The reclassifications decreased net investment
income $22 million, $5 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Investment margin

represents the excess of investment income earned over interest credited to policyholders and contractholders and
interest expense. Investment margin includes periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments used for economic hedging purposes but categorized as "non-hedge" for accounting
purposes that are included in realized capital gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investment margin increased 3.1% in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a 15.5% increase in
contractholder funds and actions to reduce crediting rates where possible, partially offset by the decline in the portfolio yield of fixed income securities. For fixed annuities and life products for
which we have the ability to modify crediting rates, the weighted average interest crediting rate was approximately 70 and 140 basis points above the long-term underlying guaranteed rate
at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The yield decline on the assets that support our capital, traditional life or other products for which the Company does not have
the ability to modify crediting rates also had a significant negative impact on the investment margin during the year.

The
investment margin increased 11.7% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to a 21.4% increase in contractholder funds. The impact of this growth was
partially offset by a decline in portfolio yields from lower market interest rates affecting the yield on the investment of cash flows from operations and investments, and a shift to sales of
investment products with lower


investment
margins, such as market value adjusted annuities ("MVAA") and funding agreements that have lower capital requirements and cash flow variability.

Mortality margin,

which represents premiums and cost of insurance contract charges less related policy benefits was $546 million in
2003, reflecting a $53 million or 8.8% decline compared to 2002. An increase in guaranteed minimum death benefits ("GMDBs") on variable annuity contracts in 2003 compared to 2002 represents
$30 million of the $53 million decline. The remainder was due to a larger number of life claims in the first quarter of 2003, poor mortality results on certain closed blocks of business
and the effect of the discontinuance of direct response non-life credit insurance, partially offset by higher mortality margin from growth of interest-sensitive life and accident and
health products sold through the workplace. In 2003, GMDB payments were $83 million, net of reinsurance, hedging results and other contractual arrangements ("net GMDB payments"), compared to
$53 million and $31 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. While 2003 net GMDB payments were higher than in 2002, improved equity market performance during 2003 resulted in sequential
quarterly reductions in gross GMDB payments. Direct response non-life credit insurance generated a mortality margin of $2 million and $7 million in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The mortality margin was comparable in 2002 and 2001 as increased contract charges from interest-sensitive life growth were offset by increased policy benefits and net GMDB payments.

Amortization of DAC

increased 3.4% during 2003 compared to 2002. The increase was primarily due to in-force business growth,
partially offset by decreased amortization from lower gross margins on variable annuities and certain fixed annuities. Amortization of DAC increased 23.6% in 2002 compared


to
2001, primarily due to higher DAC unlocking and growth of business in force. Net DAC unlocking totaled $89 million, $94 million and $2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

We
performed our annual comprehensive evaluation of DAC assumptions in the first quarter of 2003 and concluded that, due to sustained poor performance of the equity markets coupled with
an expectation of moderate future performance due to continuing weakness in the U.S. economy and uncertainty in the geopolitical environment, it was no longer reasonably possible that variable annuity
fund returns would revert to the expected long-term mean within the time horizon used in our reversion to the mean model. As a result, we unlocked the DAC assumptions for all investment
products, including variable and fixed annuities, and interest-sensitive life products, to be consistent across all product lines.

The
2003 unlocking of DAC assumptions included $124 million for variable annuities, partially offset by the effect of favorable investment margins on fixed annuities and favorable
persistency on interest-sensitive life products. The most significant assumption change involved resetting the variable annuity reversion to the mean calculation, such that future equity market
performance during the five year reversion period was reduced from 13.25% after fees to the long-term assumed return of 8% after fees.

Included
as a component of Amortization of DAC on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We
believe that as a result of the DAC unlocking performed in 2003, the variable annuity DAC asset is appropriately valued for the current economic environment. With moderate movements
in the equity markets, the likelihood of future DAC unlocking is substantially reduced since the projected return in the mean reversion period is no longer at the maximum.

The increase in total operating costs and expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to higher non-deferrable acquisition costs such as
renewal and annual trail commissions. Other operating costs and expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 decreased as higher employee benefit and technology related costs were more than offset by lower
litigation expense.

Total
operating costs and expenses increased 14.5% during 2002 compared to 2001 due to non-deferrable acquisition costs, investments in technology, expansion of the workplace
distribution channel, increased employee related benefits, advertising costs and litigation expenses. In 2003 and 2002, operating costs and expenses also include the Allstate Bank.

Adjustments
to prior year tax liabilities resulted in net unfavorable adjustments to net income of $11 million in 2003 compared with net favorable adjustments of
$42 million in 2002.

Reinsurance Ceded

We enter into reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated carriers to limit our risk of mortality losses. For
life insurance policies, depending upon the issue year and product, we may cede 90%, 80% or 60% of the mortality risk. As of December 31, 2003, 44% of our face amount of life insurance in force
is reinsured. Additionally, we cede 100% of the morbidity risk on our long-term care contracts. Since 1998, we have ceded the mortality risk on new life contracts that exceed
$2 million per individual, whereas prior to 1998, we ceded mortality risk in excess of specific amounts up to $1 million per life for individual coverage. Also, on certain
in-force variable annuity contracts we cede 100% of the mortality and certain other risks related to product features. We retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded
to reinsurers.

Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of reserves.

Developments
in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them to be
considered a higher risk. There has also been recent consolidation activity between reinsurers in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer
companies. Additionally, one of our primary reinsurers has announced its intention to no longer assume life reinsurance risks. As a result, we plan to increase our retention of term life insurance and
evaluate alternative reinsurance structures.

Our
reinsurance recoverables, summarized by the reinsurers' Standard & Poor's financial strength ratings as of December 31, are shown in the following table. In certain
cases, these ratings refer to the financial strength of the affiliated group or parent company of the reinsurer.

We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis, and a provision
for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed. At December 31, 2003, there were no reinsurance recoverable amounts that were greater than 60 days past due and we did not have an
allowance established for them. No amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three-years ended December 31, 2003.

We
enter into certain inter-company reinsurance transactions for the Allstate Financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal
entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


Allstate Financial Outlook

•

Our
ability to grow our investment margin is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates, and growing the amount of
business in force. As interest rates decrease or remain at historically low levels, we expect a reduction in our investment yields. The amount in which these lower yields will reduce our investment
margin is contingent on our ability to lower interest crediting rates on certain interest-sensitive products, which could be limited by market conditions, regulatory minimum rates or contractual
minimum rate guarantees, and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. Also, a significant amount of our invested assets are used to support our capital and
non-interest-sensitive products, which do not provide this offsetting opportunity. As a result, we expect growth in our investment margin from net new business, which also fluctuates in
relation to the interest rate environment, to be partially offset by compression in our in-force investment spreads.

•

If
equity markets perform at historical norms, we expect to see positive growth in our variable annuity gross margins from increased revenue and lower net GMDB payments on
our in-force business. However, improvements or deteriorations in our variable annuity gross margins from changes in equity markets performance creates a proportional increase or decrease
in variable annuity amortization of DAC, which will offset a significant portion of the changes in gross margins.

•

Market
conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. To eliminate some of these market concerns, we are expecting to
retain more of our mortality risk in 2004. This change will have a diminutive effect on our net income in the short-term, but will provide the foundation to drive increased
long-term growth in our life insurance business. Our mortality margins will also be more volatile in the future as we retain and manage more of our mortality risk, which will require
increased statutory capital.

INVESTMENTS

An important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolio. Investment portfolios are segmented between the Property-Liability,
Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other operations. The investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure.

Overview and Strategy

The investment strategy for the Property-Liability portfolio emphasizes safety of principal and
consistency of income within a total return framework. This approach is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. The
method for achieving this goal is based on a strategic asset allocation model, which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerance as well as the risk/return parameters of
various asset classes. This modeling, along with duration and liquidity considerations, is the guide for our asset allocation. On a tactical basis, decisions are made based on analysis of relative
value opportunities across markets. Performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights. Reviews of the portfolio are conducted regularly, including a portfolio monitoring
process that identifies securities that are impaired on an other than temporary basis. For more information see the Portfolio Monitoring section of the MD&A. This approach to balancing total return
management with income needs and risk tolerances has produced competitive returns over time.


The investment strategy for Allstate Financial is also based upon a strategic asset allocation framework that takes into account the need to manage the portfolio on a
risk-adjusted spread basis for the underlying contract liabilities and to maximize return on retained capital. Generally, a combination of recognized market, analytical and proprietary
modeling is used to achieve a desired asset mix in the management of the portfolio. The strategic asset allocation model portfolio is the primary basis for setting annual asset allocation targets with
respect to interest sensitive, illiquid and credit asset allocations as well as limitations with respect to overall below-investment-grade exposure and diversification requirements. On a tactical
basis, decisions are made on an option adjusted relative value basis staying within the constraints of the strategic asset allocation framework. We believe asset spread is maximized by selecting
assets that perform on a long-term basis and by using trading to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults. Total return measurement is used on a selective basis where the asset risks
are significant (e.g., high yield fixed income securities, convertible bonds). We expect that by employing this strategy we will minimize interest rate market impacts on investment income and provide
sustainable investment income over time.

Fixed
income securities are carried at fair value. Amortized cost basis for these securities was $30.08 billion, $50.49 billion and $2.04 billion for
Property-Liability, Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other, respectively.

Total
investments increased to $103.08 billion at December 31, 2003 from $90.65 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily due to positive cash flows from
operating and financing activities, increased unrealized gains on equity securities, assets consolidated pursuant to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation
No. 46 ("FIN 46") "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" and increased funds associated with dollar roll programs.

Property-Liability
investments were $37.86 billion at December 31, 2003 compared to $34.25 billion at December 31, 2002, due to positive cash flows from
operations and increased unrealized gains on equity securities, partially offset by dividends paid by AIC to The Allstate Corporation.

Allstate
Financial investments increased to $62.90 billion at December 31, 2003, from $55.26 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in Allstate Financial
investments was primarily due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities and increased funds associated with dollar roll programs.

Corporate
and Other investments increased to $2.33 billion at December 31, 2003, from $1.13 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily due to
the consolidation of two variable interest entities ("VIEs") used to hold assets on behalf of third-party investors under FIN 46. For further disclosure of this consolidation, see the Capital
Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A.


Total
investment balances related to collateral, primarily due to securities lending, increased to $3.75 billion at December 31, 2003, from $2.98 billion at
December 31, 2002.

We
use different methodologies to estimate the fair value of publicly and non-publicly traded marketable investment securities and exchange traded and
non-exchange traded derivative contracts. For a discussion of these methods, see the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A.

Fixed Income Securities

See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for a table showing the amortized cost,
unrealized gains, unrealized losses and fair value for each type of fixed income securities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

U.S.
government and agencies of the U.S. government securities were all rated investment grade at December 31, 2003.

Municipal
bonds, including tax-exempt and taxable securities, totaled $24.81 billion and 95.9% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2003. Approximately
59.0% of the municipal bond portfolio was insured by 7 bond insurers and accordingly have a rating of Aaa or Aa. The municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2003 consisted of approximately
3,300 issues from approximately 2,300 issuers. The largest exposure to a single issuer was less than 1.1% of the municipal bond portfolio. The ultimate obligors of approximately 12% of the municipal
bond portfolio were corporate entities.

Corporate
bonds totaled $36.49 billion and 87.1% were rated as investment grade at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the fixed income securities portfolio
contained $15.84 billion of privately placed corporate obligations or 43.4% of the total corporate obligations in the portfolio, compared with $13.08 billion at December 31, 2002.
The benefits of privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities are generally higher yields, improved cash flow predictability through pro-rata sinking funds on
many bonds, and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration, reinvestment risk and fluctuations in
interest rates. A disadvantage of privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity. At December 31, 2003, 81.5% of the privately placed
securities were rated as investment grade.

Foreign
government securities totaled $2.47 billion and 94.5% were rated investment grade at December 31, 2003.

Mortgage-backed
securities ("MBS") totaled $14.64 billion at December 31, 2003. In our MBS portfolio, the credit risk associated with MBS is mitigated due to the fact that
the portfolio consists primarily of securities that were issued by, or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by, U.S. government agencies or U.S. government sponsored entities. The MBS
portfolio is also subject to


interest
rate risk since price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of repayment of the underlying mortgages. We attempt to limit interest rate risk on these securities by
investing a portion of the portfolio in securities that provide prepayment protection. At December 31, 2003, approximately 29.3% of the MBS portfolio was invested in planned amortization class
bonds or the equivalent. Though these security types offer greater relative prepayment protection than other MBS securities, the degree of protection has been limited in this interest rate
environment. Based on market conditions and potential changes in portfolio management objectives, the value of this protection and the significance of these holdings relative to the entire portfolio
may be reduced in future periods.

Asset-backed
securities ("ABS") totaled $5.10 billion at December 31, 2003. Our ABS portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is mitigated by
monitoring the performance of the collateral. Approximately 61.0% of the ABS portfolio had a Moody's rating of Aaa or a Standard & Poor's ("S&P") rating of AAA, the highest rating category. The
ABS portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of repayment of the underlying assets. Approximately 33.0% of the ABS
portfolio is invested in securitized credit card
receivables. The remainder of the portfolio is primarily backed by securitized home equity, manufactured housing or auto loans.

At
December 31, 2003, 93.2% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating from The National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") of 1 or 2; a Moody's equivalent rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa; an S&P equivalent rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB; or a comparable internal rating.

Equity Securities

Equity securities include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, real estate investment
trust equity investments and limited partnership investments. The equity securities portfolio was $5.29 billion at December 31, 2003 compared to $3.68 billion in 2002. The
increase is attributable to higher unrealized net capital gains during 2003 and new money from operations. Gross unrealized gains totaled $1.28 billion at December 31, 2003 compared to
$562 million at December 31, 2002. Gross unrealized losses totaled $18 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $102 million at December 31, 2002.

Unrealized Gains and Losses

See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding
unrealized losses on fixed income and equity securities and factors considered in determining that they are not other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized net capital gains on fixed income and
equity securities at December 31, 2003 were $6.40 billion, an increase of $906 million


or
16.5% since December 31, 2002. Gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in the corporate fixed income portfolios and were comprised of securities in the following sectors.

December 31, 2003. The gross unrealized losses in these sectors are primarily company specific or interest rate related. While we expect eventual recovery of these securities and the related
sectors, we included every security in our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2003.

During 2003, we have experienced an increase in gross unrealized gains and a decrease in gross unrealized losses as a result of a recovering equity market. The
consumer goods sector has the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our equity portfolio at December 31, 2003, which were primarily company specific. While we expect eventual
recovery of these securities and this sector, we included every security in our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2003.

The table above includes redeemable preferred securities with a fair value of $46 million and an unrealized loss of $5 million. It also includes 73
securities that have not yet received an NAIC rating, for which we have assigned a rating based on an analysis similar to that used by the NAIC, with a fair value totaling $896 million and an
unrealized loss of $16 million. Due to lags between the funding of an investment, processing of final legal documents, filing with the Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC ("SVO"), and
rating by the SVO, we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating.

At
December 31, 2003, $262 million, or 70.8%, of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade
securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector-related credit spreads since the securities were acquired.


As
of December 31, 2003, $108 million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities. Of this amount, 34.0% was in a
significant unrealized loss position (greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost) for six or more consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003. Included among the securities that are rated
below investment grade are both public and privately placed high-yield bonds and securities that were purchased at investment grade, but have since been downgraded. We mitigate the credit
risk of investing in below-investment-grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities and through diversification of the portfolio.

The
scheduled maturity dates for fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2003 is shown below. Actual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a

Portfolio Monitoring

We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate fixed income and equity
securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair
value compared to cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods, or which are identified through other monitoring
criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which we may have concern, are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for
inclusion on our watch-list. The watch-list is reviewed in detail to determine whether any other than temporary impairment exists.

The
unrealized loss balance for fixed income and equity securities can be further segmented into the following four categories of securities, with the unrealized net loss in each
category at December 31, 2003 listed in parenthesis:

(i)

Securities
with an unrealized loss less than 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities ($290 million of unrealized loss);

(ii)

Securities
with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for a period of less than
six consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003 ($53 million of unrealized loss);

(iii)

Securities
with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for a period of six or more
consecutive months, but less than 12 consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003 ($31 million of unrealized loss); and

(iv)

Securities
with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to 20% of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for twelve or more
consecutive months prior to December 31, 2003 ($14 million of unrealized loss).


Categories
(i) and (ii) have generally been adversely affected by the downturn in the financial markets, overall economic conditions, and the market's evaluation of certain
sectors. While all of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment, the degree to which and/or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not
suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired. In general, we expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time.

For
category (iii) there were 6 equity securities with a fair value of $1 million and 9 fixed income securities with a fair value of $58 million and
$31 million of unrealized loss, with the largest unrealized loss being $7 million. Of the fixed income securities in this category, 7 securities with a fair value of $51 million
and an unrealized loss of $23 million were rated as being below investment grade at December 31, 2003.

For
category (iv) there were 9 fixed income securities with a fair value of $37 million and $14 million of unrealized loss, with the largest unrealized loss being
$5 million. All of these securities were rated as being below investment grade at December 31, 2003.

Whenever
we decide that a fixed income security's unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least 36 months or any equity security's unrealized loss of 20% or more for at least
12 months is temporary, we use a process of additional evaluations and management approvals to determine why a write-down is not required.

The
following table contains the individual securities as of December 31, 2003, with the largest unrealized losses. No other fixed income or equity security had an unrealized loss
greater than 1.0% of the total unrealized loss on fixed income and equity securities:

We also monitor the quality of our fixed income portfolio by categorizing certain investments as "problem", "restructured" or "potential problem." Problem fixed
income securities are securities in default with respect to principal or interest and/or securities issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition of the security.
Restructured fixed income securities have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring. Potential problem fixed income securities are
current with respect to contractual principal and/or interest, but because of other facts and circumstances, we have serious concerns regarding the borrower's ability to pay future principal and
interest, which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future.

We have experienced a decrease in our balance of fixed income securities categorized as potential problem as of December 31, 2003 compared to
December 31, 2002. The decrease was related primarily to the sale of holdings in this category due to specific developments causing a change in our outlook and intent to hold those securities.

We
also evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at December 31, 2003 and recorded write-downs when appropriate. We further concluded that any
remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature. While these balances may increase in the future, particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable, management expects that
the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio.

Investment write-downs during 2003 represented approximately 0.3% of the average total investment portfolio value during the year. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, the $453 million in net gains from sales was comprised of gross gains of $851 million and gross losses of $398 million. Gross losses from sales of fixed
income and equity securities were $396 million which, combined with investment write-downs on fixed income and equity securities of $290 million, represents total gross realized losses
of $686 million. Of the $396 million in gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities, $264 million resulted from sales of fixed income securities and
$132 million resulted from sales of equity securities.

In
2003, losses from sales were primarily related to routine reductions of exposures to deteriorating credits, reallocation of funds to other investments in a higher interest rate
environment and equity portfolio turnover resulting from relative value opportunities. We may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income
securities or cost for equity securities. Recognizing in certain situations new factors such as negative developments, subsequent


credit
deterioration, relative value opportunities, market liquidity concerns and portfolio reallocations can subsequently change our previous intent to continue holding a security.

The
ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $82 million with the largest being $42 million and the
smallest being $3 million. Of those losses, four related to securities that were in our unrealized loss categories (iii) or (iv).

Our
largest aggregate loss on sales and writedowns by issuer and its affiliates are shown in the following table. No other issuer and its affiliates had an aggregated loss on sales and
writedowns greater than 2.0% of the total gross loss on sales and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities.
We have also included in this table the related circumstances giving rise to the losses and a discussion of how those circumstances may have affected other material investments held.

Mortgage Loans

Our $6.54 billion mortgage loans portfolio at December 31, 2003 and
$6.09 billion at
December 31, 2002, was comprised primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate and was primarily held in the Allstate Financial portfolio. Geographical and
property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk.

We
closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis. Loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance, as well as
loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk, are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances
and placing loans on non-accrual status. The underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes
a one-year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return. We had net realized capital losses related to write-downs on mortgage loans of $4 million,
$2 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Short-Term Investments

Our short-term investment portfolio was $1.82 billion and
$2.22 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short-term securities having a final maturity date or
redemption date of one year or less.

We
also participate in securities lending, primarily as an investment yield enhancement, with third parties such as brokerage firms. We obtain collateral in an amount equal to 102% and
105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary. The
cash we receive is subsequently invested and included in short-term and fixed income investments, and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities. At December 31, 2003,
the amount of securities lending collateral reinvested in short-term investments had a carrying value of $569 million. This compares to $1.10 billion at December 31,
2002.

MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity, interest, commodity, or currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market
risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices, although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The
active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges:
1) rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios, 2) changing the character of investments purchased in the future and 3) using derivative instruments to modify the market
risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. For a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 6 of the
consolidated financial statements.

Overview

We generate substantial investable funds from our Property-Liability and Allstate Financial businesses. In
formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and
stable profits and long-term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business.

Investment
guidelines define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and control over these risk management activities. In
addition, the subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow guidelines that have been approved by their respective boards of directors and that specify the investment limits and strategies
that are appropriate given their liquidity, surplus, product, and regulatory requirements. Executive oversight of investment


risk
management processes is conducted primarily through the boards of directors and investment committees of the subsidiaries conducting investment activities. Administration and detailed managerial
oversight of investment risk, including market risk, is provided through our credit and risk management committee ("CRMC"). We also have an enterprise-wide committee called the Enterprise
Risk Council ("ERC") that is responsible for assessing risks, including market and other investment risks, on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and organizations.

We
manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation limits, duration limits and value-at-risk limits, through the use of simulation and, as
appropriate, through the use of stress tests. We have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. We have duration limits on the
Property-Liability and Allstate Financial investment portfolios and, as appropriate, on individual components of these portfolios. These duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest
rate risk that may be taken. Our value-at-risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income,
equity, and currency markets over a time interval based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors. Comprehensive day-to-day management of market
risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by the investment guidelines.

Although
we apply a common overall governance approach to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the
Property-Liability and Allstate Financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters.

Interest rate risk

is the risk that we will incur an economic loss due to adverse changes in interest rates. This risk arises from many of
our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest-sensitive assets and carry significant interest-sensitive liabilities, primarily in our Allstate Financial operations.

We
manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration. Duration measures
the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset with a duration of 5 is expected to
decrease in value by approximately 5%. At December 31, 2003, the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately 0.99, compared to a 0.34 gap at December 31, 2002.
A positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities.

Most
of our duration gap results from the Property-Liability operations, with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims. In the management of investments supporting the
Property-Liability business, we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework. This approach is designed to ensure our financial
strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. This objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the Property-Liability assets and
liabilities.

For
the Allstate Financial business, we seek to invest premiums, contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims, benefits and expenses, and that
will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. In order to achieve this objective and limit exposure to interest rate risk for Allstate Financial, we adhere to
a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities. This philosophy includes using interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, caps and floors to reduce the interest rate risk
resulting from unintended duration mismatches between assets and liabilities, and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk related to anticipated purchases
and sales of investments and product sales to customers.


We
pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts. For futures and option contracts traded on exchanges, we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling
$42 million as of December 31, 2003. For over-the-counter derivative transactions involving interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, interest rate caps,
interest rate floor agreements, and credit default swaps, master netting agreements are used. These agreements allow us to net payments due for
transactions covered by the agreements, and when applicable, we are required to post collateral. As of December 31, 2003, counterparties have posted collateral to us totaling
$333 million.

To
calculate duration, we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk-free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality,
sector attributes, liquidity and other specific risks. Duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value.
The cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments, all other financial instruments (as described in
Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements), and certain other items including unearned premiums, property-liability claims and claims expense reserves, interest-sensitive liabilities and
annuity liabilities. The projections include assumptions (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment, lapse,
leverage and/or option features of instruments, where applicable. Such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, municipal housing bonds,
callable municipal and corporate obligations, and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities. Additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of
Property-Liability policies.

Based
upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation, and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2003, we estimate that a 100 basis point immediate,
parallel increase in interest rates ("rate shock") would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately $1.77 billion, compared to $825 million at
December 31, 2002. Additionally, there are $6.20 billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest-sensitive life that are not financial instruments
and as a result have not been included in the above estimate. This amount has increased from the $5.58 billion reported at December 31, 2002 due to increases in policies in force. Based
on assumptions described above, in the event of a 100 basis point immediate increase in interest rates, these assets would decrease in value by $278 million, compared to a decrease of
$218 million at December 31, 2002. Also reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the Property-Liability interest rate risk
exposures relative to duration targets. Based on contracts in place at December 31, 2003, we would recognize realized capital gains and losses totaling $13 million in the event of a 100
basis point immediate, parallel interest rate increase and $(13) million in the event of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel interest rate decrease. The selection of a 100 basis point
immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event.

To
the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. Additionally, our calculations
assume that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. As a result, these
calculations may not fully capture the effect of non-parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and/or large changes in interest rates.

Equity price risk

is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in a particular stock, mutual fund, or stock
index. At December 31, 2003, we held approximately $4.42 billion in common stocks and $1.30 billion in other securities with equity risk (including primarily convertible
securities, limited partnership funds and non-redeemable preferred securities), compared to approximately $2.79 billion in common stocks and $1.15 billion in other equity
investments at December 31, 2002. Approximately 99.0% and 58.8% of these totals, respectively, represented assets of


the
Property-Liability operations at December 31, 2003, compared to approximately 98.6% and 52.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2002.

At
December 31, 2003, our portfolio of equity instruments had a beta of approximately 0.84, compared to a beta of approximately 0.79 at December 31, 2002. Beta represents a
widely used methodology to describe, in mathematical terms, an investment's market risk characteristics relative to the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Price Index ("S&P 500"). Based on
the beta analysis, we estimate that if the S&P 500 decreases by 10%, the fair value of our equity portfolio will decrease by approximately 8.4%. Likewise, we estimate that if the S&P 500
increases by 10%, the fair value of our equity portfolio will increase by approximately 8.4%. Based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at December 31, 2003, we
estimate that an immediate decrease in the S&P 500 of 10% would decrease the net fair value of our equity portfolio identified above by approximately $478 million, compared to
$312 million at December 31, 2002. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in the S&P 500 should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration
of the potential effect of such an event.

The
beta of our equity portfolio was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of the equity portfolio to monthly total returns of the S&P 500 over a three-year
historical period. Since beta is historically based, projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships
between stocks will not change in the future. Therefore, the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the
historical relationships.

At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had separate accounts assets with account values totaling $13.43 billion and $11.13 billion, respectively. We earn contract charges
as a percentage of these account values. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in the account values due to equity market declines, we would have earned approximately $21 million and
$18 million less in fee income at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively.

Variable
annuity contracts sold by Allstate Financial usually have a GMDB and customers may choose to purchase an enhanced GMDB, guaranteed minimum income benefits ("GMIB") prior to 2004
and beginning in 2004 a TrueReturn

SM

Accumulation Benefit ("GMAB") on certain contracts. These guarantees subject us to additional equity risk because the beneficiary or contractholder
may receive a benefit that is greater than the current account value. GMDBs are payable upon death, while GMIBs
are payable on or after the ten-year anniversary of the contract if the contractholder elects to receive a defined stream of payments ("annuitize"). GMABs are payable on a date that is
pre-determined by the contractholder, between the eighth and twentieth year of the contract. GMABs guarantee a return of up to 2.5 times (or 250%) of the amount deposited in the contract,
depending on the amount of time the contract is in force and adherence to certain fund allocations.

At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the guaranteed value of the death benefits in excess of account values was estimated to be $2.46 billion and $4.07 billion,
respectively, net of reinsurance. The decrease in this estimate between periods is attributable to improved equity markets during 2003. In both periods, approximately two-thirds of this
exposure is related to the return of deposits guarantee, while the remaining one-third is attributable to a death benefit guarantee greater than the original deposits. In addition to
reinsurance for these benefits, we entered into various derivative instruments during 2003 that were intended to offset a portion of 2003 expected death benefit payments and the risk of future death
claims on all new business issued on January 1, 2003 and later, and any payments of GMABs.

We
estimate the present value of expected future payments for GMDBs for the next 40 quarters to be approximately $145 million at December 31, 2003 compared to
$264 million at December 31, 2002. In order to calculate this estimate, we considered the current guarantees outstanding for all contracts that contain GMDBs, the expected fund
performance and the assumptions and methodology we use for


DAC
amortization. The decrease in this estimate at December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to the equity market improvement during the year. We also estimate the effect on expected future
GMDB payments in the event of extreme adverse market conditions. In the event of an immediate decline in account values of 10% due to equity market declines, payments for guaranteed death benefits at
December 31, 2003 would increase by an estimated $18 million during the next year. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market
events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. Also, our actual payment experience in the future
may not be consistent with the assumptions used in the model.

Included
among the GMIB contracts we have sold are contracts that provide the contractholder with the right to annuitize based on the highest account value at any anniversary date or on
a guaranteed earnings rate based on the initial account value over the specified period. The guaranteed benefit feature was first offered in certain of our GMIB products beginning in 1998, with
guaranteed benefits available for election by the contractholders beginning in 2008.

We
estimate the present value of expected future payments for GMIBs for the next 40 years to be approximately $15 million at December 31, 2003 compared to
$16 million at December 31, 2002. In calculating this estimate we considered the current mix of guarantees outstanding, expected fund performance and the assumptions and methodology we
use for DAC amortization. The decrease in
2003 is primarily due to improved equity markets in 2003, partially offset by the fact that contractholders are one year closer to being eligible to annuitize. We also estimate the effect on our
expected future GMIB payments in the event of extreme adverse market conditions. In the event of an immediate decline of 10% in contractholders' account values as of December 31, 2003 due to
equity market declines, there would be no immediate effect on our earnings or cash flow, since these benefits are not payable until at least 2008. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease should not
be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee. As
of December 31, 2003 we do not have a reserve established for the GMDBs or GMIBs; however, this will change with the adoption of Statement of Position 03-01 in 2004. See
Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this pending accounting change.

Additional
sales of variable annuity contracts will increase our equity risk because of these benefits. An increase in the equity markets above the December 31, 2003 level will
increase account values for these contracts, thereby decreasing the risk of the GMDBs, GMIBs and GMABs being utilized in the future. Likewise, a decrease in the equity markets that causes a decrease
in the account values will increase our equity risk because of these benefits.

In
addition to our GMDB and GMIB equity risk, at December 31, 2003 and 2002 we had approximately $1.55 billion and $1.36 billion, respectively, in equity-indexed
annuity liabilities that provide customers with guaranteed crediting rates based on the price of the S&P 500. We hedge the equity risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale
of equity-indexed options and futures, swap futures, and eurodollar futures, maintaining risk within specified value-at-risk limits.

Allstate
Financial also is exposed to equity risk in DAC. Fluctuations in the value of the variable annuity and life contract account values due to the equity market affect DAC
amortization, because the expected fee income and guaranteed benefits payable are components of the EGP for variable life and annuity contracts. For a more detailed discussion of DAC, see
Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements and the Application of Critical Accounting Policies section of the MD&A.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments and our Canadian operations. We also have funding agreement programs and a small


amount
of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies, but we use derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities.

At
December 31, 2003, we had approximately $380 million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional $492 million net investment in our
Canadian subsidiaries. These amounts
were $246 million and $375 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002. The foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the Property-Liability business.

Based
upon the information and assumptions we used at December 31, 2003, we estimate that a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we
are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately $87 million, compared with an estimated $62 million decrease at
December 31, 2002. The selection of a 10% immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the
potential effect of such an event. Our currency exposure is diversified across 31 countries, slightly reduced from 35 countries at December 31, 2002. Our largest individual currency exchange
exposures at December 31, 2003 were to the Canadian dollar (58.9%) and the British pound (10.5%). The largest individual currency exchange exposures at December 31, 2002 were to the
Canadian dollar (60.7%) and the British pound (7.3%). Our primary regional exposure is to Western Europe, approximately 27.8% at December 31, 2003, compared to 26.7% at December 31,
2002.

The
modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. Even though we believe it is very unlikely
that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse
market scenarios. Our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee.

PENSION PLANS

We have defined benefit pension plans, which cover most full-time and certain part-time employees and employee-agents. See Note 16
of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Net
periodic pension cost in 2004 is estimated to be $291 million based on current assumptions. Net periodic pension cost increased in 2003 and 2002 principally due to unfavorable
returns on plan assets, and decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on market trends and a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets. In each of the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, net pension cost included non-cash settlement charges primarily resulting from benefit payments made to agents. Settlement charges are
expected to continue in the future as payments continue to be made to agents in connection with the reorganization of Allstate's multiple agency programs to a single exclusive agency program during
2000.

As
provided for in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 87 "Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
Termination
Benefits," the market-related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five-year period, which we believe is consistent with the
long-term nature of pension obligations. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the
fluctuations actually occur.

Amounts
recorded for pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial
gains and losses. Plan assets sustained net losses in 2002 and 2001 primarily due to the decline in the equity markets. These asset losses, combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and
losses, resulted in


increased
amortization of net actuarial loss (and additional net periodic pension cost) of $92 million in 2003 and $11 million in 2002. We anticipate that the unrealized loss for our
pension plans will exceed 10% of the projected benefit obligations or 10% of the market-related value of assets during the foreseeable future, resulting in additional amortization and net periodic
pension cost.

Amounts
recorded for net periodic pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average
discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past
employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a
theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the Lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least "AA" by Standard & Poor's or at least "Aa" by Moody's on the
measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the yield curve, the mix of bonds available in
the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost and minimum pension liabilities.

Holding
other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of $48 million in net periodic
pension cost and a $762 million increase in the minimum pension liability after-tax as of October 31, 2003, our most recent measurement date, versus an increase of
$40 million in net periodic pension cost and a $224 million increase in the minimum pension liability after-tax as of October 31, 2002. A hypothetical increase of 100
basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by $40 million and would decrease the minimum pension liability after-tax by
$52 million as of October 31, 2003, versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $36 million and a $207 million decrease in the minimum pension liability
after-tax as of October 31, 2002. This non-symmetrical range results from the non-linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations, and
changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses.

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long-term assumptions
and is consistent with long-term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long-term rate of
return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are a
component of unrecognized gains or losses, which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses. As a result, the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be
experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur.

Holding
other assumptions constant, a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of
$34 million in pension cost at October 31, 2003, compared to an increase of $26 million at October 31, 2002. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of $34 million at October 31, 2003, compared to a decrease of
$26 million at October 31, 2002. Changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets do not affect the minimum pension liability.

Shareholders' equity

increased in 2003 when compared to 2002, as net income, unrealized net capital gains on
investments and a decrease in the minimum pension liability were partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases. Shareholders' equity increased in 2002 when compared to 2001,
due to higher net income and unrealized capital gains that were partially offset by an increase in the minimum pension liability, dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases. In
February 2004, we announced a $1.00 billion increase in the current share repurchase program. As of the date of this announcement, the current share repurchase program had
$1.35 billion remaining, and is expected to be completed by December 31, 2005.

Treasury
stock is a component of shareholders' equity, and since 1995, we have repurchased 263 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $8.53 billion, primarily as
part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued 68 million shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life
Investment Corporation ("AHL") and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities.

Mandatorily redeemable preferred securities

were eliminated as a separate line item on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position
effective July 1, 2003, because of the adoption of FIN 46. This accounting guidance required the de-consolidation of Allstate Financing II ("AF II"), a
subsidiary that we own 100%, and the recognition of debt that we had previously issued to AF II, the
proceeds of which are held as collateral for the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. For further discussion of the capital structure of AF II, see Note 11 of the consolidated
financial statements.

Debt

increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the adoption of FIN 46 and increases in long-term borrowings
outstanding, partly offset by declines in short-term borrowings outstanding. The adoption of FIN 46, effective July 1, 2003, increased long-term debt by
$1.05 billion, including $691 million for the consolidation of two VIEs to hold assets under the management of an affiliate on behalf of third-party investors, $112 million for
the consolidation of a VIE for a headquarters office building and up to 38 automotive collision repair stores, $45 million for the consolidation of the debt of a previously unconsolidated
investment security, and $200 million of the debt we issued to AF II that is no longer required to be consolidated. Although we are required to consolidate the two VIEs used to hold
assets on behalf of third-party investors under FIN 46, we have no legal ownership of the assets and no obligation to repay the debt. Our maximum exposure related to these two entities is the
current value of our equity investment, which totaled $12 million at December 31, 2003. Moody's and Standard and Poor's have apprised us that the reported debt associated with the
consolidation of these VIEs will


be
excluded for analytical purposes from the ratio of debt to shareholders' equity for ratings considerations. This analytical ratio was 21.3% as of December 31, 2003. For more information on
the adoption of FIN 46, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2003, we issued $400 million of 5.350% Senior Notes due in 2033, utilizing the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in
June 2000. The proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem the $300 million of 6


/


% Notes due 2003 and for general corporate purposes.

At
December 31, 2003, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.

The
increase in debt in 2002 compared to the 2001 level was primarily due to the issuance of $350 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due in 2012, and the issuance of
$250 million of 6.125% Senior Notes due in 2032. The proceeds of the $350 million issuance were used for general corporate purposes, and the proceeds of the $250 million issuance
were used to redeem $250 million of 7?% Senior Quarterly Interest Bonds. Both of the senior note issuances in 2002 were issued under an existing shelf registration statement filed with the SEC
in June 2000.

Our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall
portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. In February 2004, A.M. Best revised the outlook to
stable from positive for the insurance financial strength ratings of ALIC and certain rated subsidiaries and affiliates.

The
ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property-casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a
company's premium growth capacity. Ratios in excess of 3 to 1 are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies. AIC's premium to surplus ratio was 1.5x on
December 31, 2003 compared to 1.7x in the prior year.

State
laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer's risk-based capital ("RBC"), a measure of an insurer's solvency, falls below certain levels. The NAIC has a standard
formula for assessing RBC. The formula for calculating RBC for property-liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and
pricing. The formula for calculating RBC for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. At December 31, 2003, the RBC
for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions.


The NAIC has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial
condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities. The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance
companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined "usual ranges". Generally, regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of
the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. The ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges.

Property-Liability

Higher operating cash flows of the Property-Liability business in 2003 and 2002 were
primarily due to increased underwriting income. In 2003, operating cash flows were also impacted by contributions made to our defined benefit pension plans. Cash used in investing activities increased
in 2003 and 2002 as higher operating cash flows were invested in the fixed income and equity portfolios.

Cash
flows of the Property-Liability business are also impacted by dividends paid by AIC to its parent, The Allstate Corporation. These dividends totaled $1.18 billion,
$675 million and $1.24 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial
statements.

Allstate Financial

Higher operating cash flows of Allstate Financial in 2003 and 2002 primarily relates to increases in
investment income, partially offset by an increase in benefits and acquisition related expenses from new business growth. Cash flows used in investing activities declined in 2003 compared to 2002 as
the investment of higher operating cash flows were offset by lower financing cash flow.

Lower
cash flow from financing activities during 2003 reflects an increase in maturities of institutional products and benefits and withdrawals from contractholders' accounts, partially
offset by increased deposits received from contractholders. Higher cash provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects increased deposits received from contractholders. For quantification of the
changes in contractholder funds, see the Allstate Financial Segment section of the MD&A. A portion of the Allstate Financial product portfolio, primarily fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life
insurance products, is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders. The following table summarizes Allstate Financial's liabilities for these products by their contractual
withdrawal provisions at December 31, 2003. Approximately 14.8% of these liabilities is subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustment.

To
ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment, we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various
scenarios.


Corporate and Other

Higher uses of cash in the investing activities of our Corporate and Other segment during 2003 reflect
additional net investments made in the portfolio of the subsidiary, Kennett Capital. Financing cash flows of the Corporate and Other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in
short-term debt, proceeds from the issuance of debt, dividends to shareholders of The Allstate Corporation and share repurchases; therefore, when we increase or decrease the level of these
activities, financing cash flows are affected.

Long-term
debt and invested assets increased during 2003 related to the adoption of FIN 46. However since these increases did not impact our cash flows and were
non-cash entries, they had no impact to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

We
have established external sources of short-term liquidity that include a commercial paper program, lines-of-credit, dollar rolls and repurchase
agreements. In the aggregate, at December 31, 2003 these sources could provide over $2.3 billion of additional liquidity. For additional liquidity, we can issue new insurance contracts,
incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio. The liquidity of the investment portfolio varies by type of investment. For example, $15.84 billion of privately placed
corporate obligations that represent 15.4% of the investment portfolio, and $6.54 billion of mortgage loans that represent 6.3% of the investment portfolio, generally are considered to be less
liquid than many of our other types of investments, such as our U.S. government and agencies, municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios.

We
have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows:

•

A
commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of $1.00 billion to cover short-term cash needs. As of December 31, 2003, there were no
borrowings outstanding; however, the outstanding balance fluctuates daily.

•

Two
primary credit facilities and one additional credit facility totaling $1.20 billion to cover short-term liquidity requirements. These consist of a
$575 million five-year revolving line of credit expiring in 2006, a $575 million 364-day revolving line of credit expiring in the second quarter of 2004 and a
$50 million one-year
revolving line of credit expiring in the third quarter of 2004. The right to borrow under the five-year and 364-day facilities is subject to requirements that are customary for
facilities of this size, type and purpose. These requirements are currently being met and we expect to continue to meet them in the future. There were no borrowings under any of these lines of credit
during 2003. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the three credit facilities is limited to $1.20 billion.

•

The
right to issue up to an additional $2.80 billion of debt securities, equity securities, warrants for debt and equity securities, trust preferred securities, stock
purchase contracts and stock purchase units utilizing the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2003.

Certain
remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade
in our long-term debt rating of A1 and A+ (from Moody's and Standard & Poor's, respectively) to non-investment grade status of below Baa3/BBB-, a downgrade
in AIC's financial strength rating from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moody's, Standard & Poor's and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Baa/BBB/A-, or a downgrade in ALIC's financial
strength ratings from Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moody's, Standard & Poor's and A.M. Best, respectively) to below Aa3/AA-/A-. The rating agencies also consider the
interdependence of our individually rated entities, and therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities.

REGULATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Regulation

We are subject to changing social, economic and regulatory conditions. Recent state and federal regulatory
initiatives and proceedings have included efforts to influence and restrict premium rates in a manner adverse to insurers, restrict the ability of insurers to cancel policies, limit insurers' ability
to impose underwriting standards and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance products and the insurance industry. The ultimate changes and eventual effects of these initiatives on our
business, if any, are uncertain.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in various legal and regulatory actions that have an effect on specific aspects of our
business. Like other members of the insurance industry, we are the target of an increasing number of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial
or indeterminate amounts. For a detailed description of these actions, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements.

PENDING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

As of December 31, 2003, there are several pending and proposed accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been
finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred. These standards include Statement of Position 03-01, FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1 and
Emerging Issues Task Force Topic number 03-01. For a discussion of these pending and proposed standards, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. Based on our
interpretation and application of Statement of Position 03-01, we estimate that upon adoption on January 1, 2004, it will impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations in
the range of $150 million to $200 million. However, the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on
market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we
are unable to determine prior to implementation. For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes
these standards or until we implement them.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS

This document contains "forward-looking statements" that anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These
statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a
result of new information or future events or developments.

These
forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like "plans," "seeks," "expects," "will," "should,"
"anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "believes," "likely," "targets" and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, product
development, regulatory approvals, market position, expenses, financial results, litigation and reserves. We believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans.
However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans underlying the forward-looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those
communicated in these forward-looking statements. Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to
those discussed or identified in this document (including the risks described below) and in our public filings with the SEC.

In
addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below, which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other
financial services.


Risks Relating to the Property-Liability business

As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events

Because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from
one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, tropical storms, wildfires and terrorism. While
we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives have reduced the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses, we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could
have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position. For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Andrew in 1992, totaling
$2.3 billion, and to the Northridge earthquake of 1994, totaling $2.1 billion. We are also exposed to assessments from the California Earthquake Authority and various Florida
state-created catastrophe loss management facilities, and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple
catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings.

In
addition, we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as snowstorms, ice storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are
inherently unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and homeowners claims when severe weather conditions occur.

Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability

Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Property-Liability business. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven
primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car
prices. Changes in homeowner's claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors.
However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of changes in the rate of inflation in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can
arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict. Examples of such events include a decision in 2001 by the Georgia Supreme Court that diminished value coverage was included in
auto policies under Georgia law, and the emergence of mold-related homeowners losses in the state of Texas. Although we are currently pursuing various loss management initiatives in the
Allstate Protection segment that seek to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future
increases in claim severity.

Recently,
our Allstate Protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency. We believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors, including
an increase in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders, a decrease in policyholder submission of claims for minor
losses, and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria. The recent favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term. A significant increase
in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims

Recorded claim reserves in the Property-Liability business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and incurred but not reported, after
considering known facts and circumstances, internal factors including our experience with similar losses, historical trends involving claim payment


patterns,
loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including changes in regulation,
court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes. Because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including
reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating
results and financial condition.

Predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain

The process of estimating asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning, among other things,
the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are, or were ever intended to be, covered; the ability of policyholders to file claims or add claimants to active
claims; and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Asbestos-related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations
are complex, lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers. While we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos,
environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves, these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss. Consequently, ultimate net losses
from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries, and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, operating results and financial position.

Regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability

From time to time, political events and positions affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach
targeted levels of profitability. Moreover, because Allstate Protection's loss ratio currently compares favorably to that of the industry, state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts
to raise rates in the future even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases. Such resistance affects our ability in all product lines
to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity.

In
addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property-liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans,
reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurer's ability to charge an adequate price or mandating
subsidized rates. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at an inadequate or subsidized price, leading to an unacceptable return on capital. Laws and
regulations of many states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department.
Additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies
doing business in the state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors.

The potential benefits of implementing SRM may not be fully realized

We believe that the tier-based pricing and underwriting approach (including the use of credit history as an underwriting criterion) used in SRM has
allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably. However, our competitors may adopt underwriting criteria and tier-based pricing models similar to those used in SRM. Further,
the use of credit history as a factor in underwriting and


pricing
has at times been challenged by regulators, legislators, litigants and special interest groups in various states. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify SRM. Furthermore, because
we have been using SRM only for the last several years, we cannot make assurances that SRM underwriting criteria and tier-based pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses
that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated through the use of SRM. Moreover, to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers, our
expectation that the amount of business written using SRM will increase may not be realized.

Allstate Protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business

The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive
underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. In 2002
and 2003, prices in Allstate Protection's principal lines increased more quickly than in prior years, and underwriting standards became more stringent. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the
property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Relating to the Allstate Financial Segment

Changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability

Reserve for life-contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields,
mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses. We periodically review and revise our reserve estimates and if future experience differs from assumptions, adjustments to reserves may be
required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread-based products

Our ability to manage the Allstate Financial investment margin for spread-based products is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment
yields and interest crediting rates on business. As interest rates decrease or remain at historically low levels, assets may be reinvested at lower yields, reducing investment margin. For example,
during 2003 the average pre-tax investment yield for the Allstate Financial portfolio declined to 6.0% from 6.7% in 2002. Lowering interest crediting rates can offset decreases in
investment margin on some products. However, these changes could be limited by market conditions, regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match
the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. Decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and/or changes
in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these
products. Increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on Allstate Financial, for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments, which can lead to higher
surrenders at a time when the segment's investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates. Unanticipated surrenders could result in DAC unlocking or affect the
recoverability of DAC and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability.

Declining equity markets may reduce both sales of products and income from contract charges and may adversely affect operating results and financial condition

Conditions in the United States and international stock markets affect Allstate Financial's sales of variable annuities. Recent allegations of improper or illegal
trading activities at large mutual fund


complexes
could affect the stock markets. In general, sales of variable annuities decrease when stock markets are declining over an extended period of time. The effect of decreasing separate accounts
balances resulting from volatile equity markets, lower underlying fund performance or declining consumer confidence could cause contract charges earned to decrease. In addition, it is possible that
the assumptions and projections we use to establish prices for GMDB, GMIB and GMAB products, particularly assumptions and projections about investment performance, do not accurately reflect the level
of costs that we will ultimately incur in providing those benefits, resulting in adverse margin trends. These factors may result in accelerated DAC amortization and require increases in reserves,
which would reduce statutory capital and surplus and/or Allstate Financial's net income. Poor fund performance could also result in higher partial withdrawals of account value which, for some
contracts, do not reduce the GMDB by a proportional amount.

Changes in estimates of profitability on interest-sensitive products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of DAC

DAC related to interest-sensitive life, variable annuity and investment contracts is amortized in proportion to EGP over the estimated lives of the contracts.
Assumptions underlying EGP, including those relating to margins from mortality, investment margin, contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, are updated from time to time in order
to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of DAC. Updates to these assumptions could result in DAC unlocking, which in turn could adversely affect our
operating results and financial condition.

A loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales

Certain products in the Allstate Financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated
with us. Termination of one or more of these agreements due to, for example, a change in control of one of these distributors, could have a detrimental effect on the sales of Allstate Financial. This
risk may be heightened by the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the "GLB Act"), which eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms,
insurers and other financial service providers.

Changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products

Under current federal and state income tax law, certain products (primarily life insurance and annuities) we offer receive favorable tax treatment. This favorable
treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products. Congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable
policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life
insurance and annuities. One such proposal was enacted in May 2003 when President Bush signed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which reduced the federal income tax
rates applicable to certain dividends and capital gains realized by individuals. Legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could
lessen the advantage of certain of our products as compared to competing products. Such proposals, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such
products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies. In addition, recent changes in the federal estate tax laws have negatively affected the demand for the types of life
insurance used in estate planning.


Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry

Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive

The insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have well-established national reputations and market similar insurance
products. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents, there can be no assurance that we will continue to
effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, we may face
increased competition from banks. Until passage of the GLB Act, the ability of banks to engage in securities-related businesses was limited and banks were restricted from being affiliated with
insurers. With the passage of the GLB Act, mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms under one holding company are now permitted. The ability of banks to affiliate with
insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors. Furthermore, certain competitors
operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore, may have dissimilar profitability and return targets.

Changing interest rates and declines in credit quality may have adverse effects

A decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the
portfolio's average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may prepay or redeem securities we hold more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates. An increase
in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial
majority of our investment portfolio. Increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of
fixed income securities are lower. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities,
including realized losses relating to derivative strategies not adequately addressing portfolio risks. A declining market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to
decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation, resulting in additional pension liability and expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plans.

We may suffer losses from litigation

As is typical for a large insurance group, we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation. Among other things, we, like other participants in the insurance
industry, have been subject in recent years to an increasing volume of class action litigation challenging a range of industry practices. Our litigation exposure could result in a material adverse
effect on our operating results and financial condition in a future period in the event of an unexpected adverse outcome or if additional reserves are required to be established for such litigation.
For a description of our current material litigation matters, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements.

We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth

We are subject to extensive regulation by state insurance regulators. This regulation is focused on the protection of policyholders and not investors. In many
cases, state regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business. Additionally, we have various entities registered under the federal securities laws as broker-dealers,
investment advisers and/or investment companies. These entities are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the SEC, the National Association of


Securities
Dealers and, in some cases, state securities administrators. The laws regulating the securities products and activities of Allstate Financial are complex, numerous and subject to change.
Further, in recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny, and proposals that would provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies
have been discussed by members of Congress. We can make no assurances as to whether further state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance
industry or as to the effect that any such measures would have on us.

The unavailability of reinsurance may limit our ability to write new business

Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain
continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available. If we were unable to maintain
our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in
our net liability exposure or reduce our insurance writings.

Reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance

The collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including whether insured losses meet the qualifying
conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract.
Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim expense we incur and the value of our investment portfolio

The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States and abroad, and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response
to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the equity markets in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and result in loss of life, property damage, additional
disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused
by the continued threat of terrorism. In the event that a terrorist act occurs, both Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial may be adversely affected, depending on the nature of the event. We seek
to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent
that it is commercially available.

Any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position

Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally will have an effect on an insurance
company's business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer's ratings due to, for
example, a decline in the value of an insurer's investment portfolio or increased liabilities for variable contracts arising from additional GMDB, GMIB or GMAB exposure resulting from market declines.
Currently, the insurance financial strength ratings of both AIC and ALIC are Aa2, AA and A+ (from Moody's, Standard & Poor's and A.M. Best, respectively). Because these ratings are
subject to periodic review, the continued retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales, including
the competitiveness and marketability of our product offerings, as well as our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.


Changes in accounting standards issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements

Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or
revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current
accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. For a description of
potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.

The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our debt service obligations

The Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. The principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries. State insurance regulatory
authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, competitive pressures generally require the
subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the
ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     General

Basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Allstate Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, primarily Allstate
Insurance Company ("AIC"), a property-liability insurance company with various property-liability and life and investment subsidiaries, including Allstate Life Insurance Company ("ALIC") (collectively
referred to as the "Company" or "Allstate"). These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

To
conform to the 2003 presentation, certain amounts in the prior years' consolidated financial statements and notes have been reclassified.

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Nature of operations

Allstate is engaged, principally in the United States and Canada, in the property-liability insurance, life insurance and investment product businesses.
Allstate's primary business is the sale of private passenger
auto and homeowner's insurance. The Company also sells a variety of other personal property and casualty insurance products, life insurance, investment and retirement products, and selected commercial
property and casualty coverages. Allstate primarily distributes its products through approximately 12,900 exclusive agencies and financial specialists and approximately 14,200 independent agencies.

The
Allstate Protection segment principally sells private passenger auto and homeowner's insurance, with earned premiums accounting for approximately 77% of Allstate's 2003 consolidated
revenues. Allstate was the country's second largest insurer for both private passenger auto and homeowners insurance in 2002. Allstate Protection, through a variety of companies, is authorized to sell
certain property-liability products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The Company is also authorized to sell certain insurance products in Canada. For 2003, the top
geographic locations for premiums earned by the Allstate Protection segment were Texas, California, New York and Florida. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5% of premiums earned for
Allstate Protection.

Allstate
has exposure to catastrophes, an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance business, which have contributed to, and will continue to contribute to, material
year-to-year fluctuations in the Company's results of operations and financial position (see Note 7). The Company also has exposure to environmental and asbestos claims
and other discontinued lines exposures (see Note 13).

The
Allstate Financial segment markets a diversified portfolio of retail and institutional products to meet customers' needs in the areas of financial protection, savings and retirement
through a variety of distribution channels. The retail products include term life; permanent life such as whole life, interest-sensitive life, variable life, and single premium life; fixed annuities
such as traditional deferred annuities, market value adjusted annuities, equity-indexed annuities, treasury-linked annuities and immediate annuities; variable annuities; and other protection products
such as long-term care, accidental death, hospital indemnity, and disability income insurance. Institutional products primarily include funding agreements sold to qualified investors.


Allstate
Financial, through a variety of companies, is authorized to sell life insurance and investment products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands and Guam. For 2003, the top geographic locations for statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment were Delaware, California, New York, Florida, Texas, and
Pennsylvania. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5% of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for Allstate Financial. Allstate Financial distributes its products through a variety of
distribution channels including Allstate exclusive agencies, independent agents (including master brokerage agencies), financial institutions and broker/dealers. Although the Company currently
benefits from agreements with financial services entities that market and distribute its products, change in control of these non-affiliated entities could negatively impact Allstate
Financial's sales.

The
Company monitors economic and regulatory developments that have the potential to impact its business. Federal legislation has allowed banks and other financial organizations to have
greater participation in the securities and insurance businesses. This legislation may result in an increased level of competition for sales of the Company's products. Furthermore, state and federal
laws and regulations affect the taxation of insurance companies and life insurance and annuity products. Congress and various state legislatures have considered proposals that, if enacted, could
impose a greater tax burden on the Company or could have an adverse impact on the tax treatment of some insurance products offered by the Company, including favorable policyholder tax treatment
currently applicable to life insurance and annuities. Recent legislation that reduced the federal income tax rates applicable to certain dividends and capital gains realized by individuals, or other
proposals, if adopted, that reduce the taxation, or permit the establishment, of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance or annuities could have an adverse effect on the
Company's financial position or ability to sell such products. In addition, recent changes in the federal estate tax laws have negatively affected the demand for the types of life insurance used in
estate planning.

2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Investments

Fixed income securities include bonds, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and redeemable preferred stocks. Fixed income securities are carried at fair
value and may be sold prior to their contractual maturity ("available for sale"). The fair value of publicly traded fixed income securities is based upon independent market quotations. The fair value
of non-publicly traded securities is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data (e.g., term structures
and current publicly traded bond prices) as inputs or independent third party pricing sources. The valuation models use indicative information such as ratings, industry, coupon, and maturity along
with related third party data and publicly traded bond prices to determine security specific spreads. These spreads are then adjusted for illiquidity based on historical analysis and broker surveys.
Periodic changes in fair values, net of deferred income taxes, certain life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs, and certain reserves for life-contingent contract benefits, are
reflected as a component of other comprehensive income. Cash received from calls, principal payments and make-whole payments is reflected as a component of proceeds from sales. Cash
received from maturities and pay-downs is reflected as a component of investment collections.

Equity
securities include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, real estate investment trust equity investments, and limited partnership interests. Common and
non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate investment trust equity investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value if independent market quotations are
available. If independent market quotations are not available, these securities are carried at cost. The difference between cost and fair value, net of deferred income taxes, is reflected as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income.


Investments
in limited partnership interests are accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting except for instances in which the Company's interest is so minor that it exercises
virtually no influence over operating and financial policies, in which case, the Company applies the cost method of accounting.

Mortgage
loans are carried at outstanding principal balances, net of unamortized premium or discount and valuation allowances. Valuation allowances are established for impaired loans
when it is probable that contractual principal and interest will not be collected. Valuation allowances for impaired loans reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the collateral or the present
value of the loan's expected future repayment cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate.

Short-term
investments are carried at cost or amortized cost that approximates fair value, and generally include the reinvestment of collateral received in connection with
certain securities included in repurchase, resale and lending activities and derivative transactions. For these transactions, the Company records an offsetting liability in other liabilities and
accrued expenses for the Company's obligation to repay the collateral. Other investments, which consist primarily of policy loans, are carried at the unpaid principal balances.

Investment
income consists primarily of interest and dividends, net investment income from partnership interests and income for certain derivative transactions. Interest is recognized on
an accrual basis and dividends are recorded at the ex-dividend date. Interest income on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is determined using the effective yield method, based on
estimated principal repayments. Interest income on certain beneficial interests in securitized financial assets is determined using the prospective yield method, based upon projections of expected
future cash flows. Income from investments in partnership interests, accounted for on the cost basis, is recognized upon receipt of amounts distributed by the partnerships as income. Accrual of income
is suspended for fixed income securities and mortgage loans that are in default or when the receipt of interest payments is in doubt.

Realized
capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investment dispositions, write-downs in value due to other than temporary declines in fair value and changes in the fair
value of certain derivatives including related periodic and final settlements. Realized capital gains and losses on investment dispositions are determined on a specific identification basis.

The
Company writes down, to fair value, any fixed income or equity security that is classified as other than temporarily impaired in the period the security is deemed to be other than
temporarily impaired.

Derivative and embedded derivative financial instruments

The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", and SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities", as of January 1, 2001.
The impact of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 (the "statements") to the Company was a loss of $9 million, after-tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Derivative
financial instruments include swaps, futures, options, interest rate caps and floors, warrants, certain forward contracts for purchases of
to-be-announced ("TBA") mortgage securities, certain investment risk transfer reinsurance agreements, forward sale commitments and certain bond forward purchase commitments,
mortgage funding commitments and mortgage forward sale commitments. Derivatives that are required to be separated from the host instrument and accounted


for
as derivative financial instruments ("subject to bifurcation") are embedded in convertible and other fixed income securities, equity-indexed life and annuity contracts, certain variable life and
annuity contracts, modified coinsurance contracts and trust preferred securities issued (see Note 6).

All
derivatives are accounted for on a fair value basis and reported as other investments, other assets, other liabilities and accrued expenses or contractholder funds. Embedded
derivative instruments subject to bifurcation are also accounted for on a fair value basis and are reported together with the host contract. The change in the fair value of derivatives embedded in
assets and subject to bifurcation is reported in realized capital gains and losses. The change in the fair value of derivatives embedded in liabilities and subject to bifurcation is reported in life
and annuity contract benefits or realized capital gains and losses.

When
derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value or foreign currency cash flow
hedges. The hedged item may be either all or a specific portion of a recognized asset, liability or an unrecognized firm commitment attributable to a particular risk. At the inception of the hedge,
the Company formally documents the hedging relationship and risk management objective and strategy. The documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being
hedged and the
methodology used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value attributable to the hedged risk, or in the case of a cash flow
hedge, the exposure to changes in the hedged item's or transaction's variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The Company does not exclude any component of the change in fair value
of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment. At each reporting date, the Company confirms that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk.
Ineffectiveness in fair value hedges and cash flow hedges is reported in realized capital gains and losses. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the hedge ineffectiveness
reported as realized capital gains and losses amounted to gains of $9 million, losses of $15 million and gains of $6 million, respectively.

Fair value hedges

The Company designates certain of its interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and certain
investment risk transfer reinsurance agreements as fair value hedges when the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged item.

For
hedging instruments used in fair value hedges, when the hedged items are investment assets or a portion thereof, the change in the fair value of the derivatives is reported in net
investment income, together with the change in the fair value of the hedged items. The change in the fair value of hedging instruments used in fair value hedges of contractholder funds liabilities or
a portion thereof are reported in life and annuity contract benefits, together with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Accrued periodic settlements on swaps are reported together with
the changes in fair value of the swaps in net investment income, life and annuity contract benefits or interest expense. The book value of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted for the change in
the fair value of the hedged risk.

Cash flow hedges

The Company designates certain of its foreign currency swap contracts and bond forward commitments as cash
flow hedges when the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting the exposure of variations in cash flows for the hedged risk that could affect net income. The Company's cash flow exposure
may be associated with an existing asset, liability, or a forecasted transaction. Anticipated transactions must be probable of occurrence and their significant terms and specific characteristics must
be identified.

For
hedging instruments used in cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified to net
investment


income
or realized capital gains and losses as the hedged transaction affects net income or when the forecasted transaction affects net income. Accrued periodic settlements on derivatives used in cash
flow hedges are reported in net investment income. The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income for a hedged transaction is limited to the lesser of the cumulative gain or loss on the
derivative less the amount reclassified to net income; or the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative needed to offset the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged
transaction from inception of the hedge less the derivative gain or loss previously reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income. If the Company expects at any time that the
loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to a net loss on the combination of the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction which may not be recoverable, a loss is
recognized immediately in realized capital gains and losses. If an impairment loss is recognized on an asset or an additional obligation is incurred on a liability involved in a hedge transaction, any
offsetting gain in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified and reported together with the impairment loss or recognition of the obligation.

Termination of hedge accounting

If, subsequent to entering into a hedge transaction, the derivative becomes ineffective
(including if the hedged item is sold or otherwise extinguished, the occurrence of a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, or the hedged asset becomes impaired), the Company may
terminate the derivative position. The Company may also terminate derivative instruments or redesignate them as non-hedge as a result of other events or circumstances. If the derivative
financial instrument is not terminated when a fair value hedge is no longer effective, the future gains and losses recognized on the derivative are reported in realized capital gains and losses. When
a fair value hedge is no longer effective, is redesignated as a non-hedge, or for which the derivative has been terminated, the gain or loss recognized on the item being hedged and used to
adjust the book value of the asset, liability or portion thereof is amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item to net investment income or life and annuity contract benefits, beginning in
the period that hedge accounting is no longer applied. If the hedged item of a fair value hedge is an asset which has become impaired, the adjustment made to the book value of the asset is subject to
the accounting policies applied to impaired assets. When a derivative financial instrument used in a cash flow hedge of an existing asset or liability is no longer effective or is terminated, the gain
or loss recognized on the derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income as the hedged risk impacts net income, beginning in the period hedge accounting is no
longer applied or the derivative instrument is terminated. If the derivative financial instrument is not terminated when a cash flow hedge is no longer effective, the future gains and losses
recognized on the derivative are reported in realized capital gains and losses. When a derivative financial instrument used in a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction is terminated because the
forecasted transaction is no longer probable, or if the cash flow hedge is no longer effective, the gain or loss recognized on the derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income to realized capital gains and losses in the period that hedge accounting is no longer applied.

Non-hedge derivative financial instruments

The Company also has certain derivatives that are used in interest
rate, equity price and credit risk management strategies for which hedge accounting is not applied. These derivatives primarily consist of indexed instruments, certain interest rate swap agreements
and financial futures contracts, interest rate cap and floor agreements, certain forward contracts for TBA mortgage securities and credit default swaps. Based upon the type of derivative instrument
and strategy, the income statement effects of these derivatives are reported in a single line item, generally with the results of the associated risk. Therefore, the derivatives' fair value gains and
losses and accrued periodic settlements are recognized together in one of the following during the reporting period: net investment income, realized capital gains and losses, operating costs and
expenses or life and annuity contract benefits.


Security repurchase and resale and securities loaned

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, including a mortgage dollar roll program, are treated as
financing arrangements and the related obligations to return the collateral are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or reacquired, including accrued interest, as
specified in the respective agreements. The Company's policy is to take possession or control of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Assets to be repurchased are the same, or
substantially the same, as the assets transferred and the transferor, through the right of substitution, maintains the right and ability to redeem the collateral on short notice. The market value of
securities to be repurchased or resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained, where appropriate, to protect against credit exposure.

Securities
loaned are treated as financing arrangements and the collateral received is recorded in short-term investments, fixed income securities and other liabilities and
accrued expenses. The Company obtains collateral in an amount equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively. The Company monitors the market value of
securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains additional collateral as necessary. Substantially all of the Company's securities loaned are on loan with large brokerage firms.

Security
repurchase and resale agreements and securities lending transactions are used to generate net investment income. The cash received from repurchase and resale agreements also
provides a source of liquidity. These instruments are short-term in nature (usually 30 days or less) and are collateralized principally by U.S. Government and mortgage-backed
securities. The carrying values of these instruments approximate fair value because of their relatively short-term nature.

Recognition of premium revenues and contract charges, and related benefits and interest credited

Property-liability premiums are deferred and earned on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. The portion of premiums written applicable to
the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums. Premium installment receivables, net, include premiums written and not yet collected. The Company regularly evaluates premium
installment receivables and establishes valuation allowances as appropriate. The valuation allowance for uncollectible premium installment receivables was $44 million and $51 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Traditional
life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, primarily term and whole life insurance products. Premiums from these
products are recognized as revenue when due. Benefits are recognized in relation to such revenue so as to result in the recognition of profits over the life of the policy and are reflected in life and
annuity contract benefits.

Immediate
annuities with life contingencies, including certain structured settlement annuities, provide insurance protection over a period that extends beyond the period during which
premiums are collected. Gross premiums in excess of the net premium on immediate annuities with life contingencies are deferred and recognized over the contract period. Contract benefits are
recognized in relation to such revenue so as to result in the recognition of profits over the life of the policy.

Interest-sensitive
life contracts, such as universal life and single premium life, are insurance contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed. The terms that may be changed include
premiums paid by the contractholder, interest credited to the contractholder account balance and any amounts assessed against the contractholder account balance. Premiums from these contracts are
reported as contractholder fund deposits. Contract charges consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balance for cost of insurance (mortality risk), contract administration and early
surrender.


These
revenues are recognized when assessed against the contractholder account balance. Life and annuity contract benefits include life-contingent benefit payments in excess of the
contractholder account balance.

Contracts
that do not subject the Company to significant risk arising from mortality or morbidity are referred to as investment contracts. Fixed annuities, including market value
adjusted annuities, equity-indexed annuities and immediate annuities without life contingencies, certain guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs") and funding agreements are considered investment
contracts. Deposits received for such contracts are reported as contractholder fund deposits. Contract charges for investment contracts consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account
balance for contract administration and early surrender. These revenues are recognized when assessed against the contractholder account balance.

Interest
credited to contractholder funds represents interest accrued or paid for interest-sensitive life contracts and investment contracts. Crediting rates for certain fixed annuities
and interest-sensitive life contracts are adjusted periodically by the Company to reflect current market conditions subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates. Crediting rates for indexed
annuities and indexed life products are based on a specified interest rate index, such as LIBOR, or an equity index, such as the S&P 500.

Separate
accounts products include variable annuities and variable life insurance contracts. The assets supporting these products are legally segregated and available only to settle
separate accounts contract obligations. Deposits received are reported as separate accounts liabilities. Contract charges for these products consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account
values for contract maintenance, administration, mortality, expense and early surrender. Contract benefits incurred include guaranteed minimum death benefits paid on variable annuity contracts.

Deferred policy acquisition costs

Costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring property-liability insurance, life insurance and investment business are deferred and recorded as
deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"). These costs are principally agents' and brokers' remuneration, premium taxes, inspection costs, certain underwriting costs and direct mail solicitation
expenses. All other acquisition expenses are charged to operations as incurred and included in operating costs and expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. DAC associated with
property-liability insurance is amortized to income as premiums are earned, and is included in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Future
investment income is considered in determining the recoverability of DAC. DAC associated with life insurance and investment business is periodically reviewed for recoverability and written down when
necessary.

For
traditional life insurance and other premium paying contracts, such as immediate annuities with life contingencies and limited payment contracts, DAC is amortized in proportion to
the estimated revenues on such business. Assumptions used in amortization of DAC and reserve calculations are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issue and are generally not
revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in force, resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels, and any estimated premium deficiencies
change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization period for these contracts approximates the estimated lives of the policies.


For internal exchanges of traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies, the unamortized balance of costs previously deferred under
the original contracts are charged to income. The new costs associated with the exchange are deferred and amortized to income.

For
interest-sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts, DAC is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the present value of estimated gross profits ("EGP") on such
business over the estimated lives of the contracts. Generally, the amortization period ranges from 15-30 years; however, estimates of customer surrender rates result in the majority
of deferred costs being amortized over the surrender charge period. The rate of amortization during this term is matched to the pattern of EGP. EGP consists of the following components: margins from
mortality including guaranteed minimum death and income benefits; contract administration, surrender and other contract charges, less maintenance expenses; and investment margin, including realized
capital gains and losses.

DAC
amortization for variable annuity and life contracts is significantly impacted by the return on the underlying funds. The Company's long-term expectation of separate
accounts fund performance after fees is approximately 8%, which is consistent with its pricing assumptions. Whenever actual separate accounts fund performance based on the two most recent years varies
from the 8% expectation, the Company projects performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return over that seven year period equals the long-term 8% expectation. This
approach is commonly referred to as "reversion to the mean" and is commonly used by the life insurance industry as an appropriate method for amortizing variable annuity and life DAC. In applying the
reversion to the mean process, the Company does not allow the future rates of return after fees projected over the five-year period to exceed 12.75% or fall below 0%. The Company
periodically evaluates the utilization of this process to determine that it is reasonably possible that variable annuity and life fund performance will revert to the expected long-term
mean within this time horizon.

Changes
in the amount or timing of the incidence of EGP result in adjustments to the cumulative amortization of DAC. All such adjustments are reflected in the current results of
operations.

The
Company performs quarterly reviews of DAC recoverability for interest-sensitive life, variable annuities and investment contracts in the aggregate using current assumptions. If a
change in the amount of EGP is significant, it could result in the unamortized DAC not being recoverable, resulting
in a charge which is included as a component of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The
cost assigned to the right to receive future cash flows from certain business purchased from other insurers is also classified as deferred policy acquisition costs in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The costs capitalized represent the present value of future profits expected to be earned over the life of the contracts acquired. These costs are
amortized as profits emerge over the life of the acquired business and are periodically evaluated for recoverability. Present value of future profits was $182 million and $236 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Amortization expense on present value of future profits was $55 million, $49 million, and $63 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Reinsurance recoverables

In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to limit aggregate and single exposure to losses on large risks by purchasing reinsurance from reinsurers (see
Note 9). The amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include amounts billed to reinsurers on losses paid as well as estimates of amounts expected to be recovered
from reinsurers on incurred losses that have not yet been paid. Reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses are estimated based upon assumptions consistent with those used in establishing the
liabilities related to the underlying reinsured contract.


Insurance
liabilities are reported gross of reinsurance recoverables. Prepaid reinsurance premiums are deferred and reflected in income in a manner consistent with the recognition of premiums on the
reinsured contracts. Reinsurance does not extinguish the Company's primary liability under the policies written. Therefore, the Company regularly evaluates reinsurers and amounts recoverable and
establishes allowances for uncollectible reinsurance as appropriate.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 142, "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets", effective January 1, 2002. The statement eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and requires that goodwill and separately
identified intangible assets with indefinite lives be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) on a fair value basis.

Had
Allstate adopted the non-amortization provisions on January 1, 2001, net income and the related basic and diluted per share amounts for the year ended
December 31, 2001 would have been as follows:

During the second quarter of 2002, the Company completed its initial goodwill impairment test and recorded a $331 million after-tax impairment
charge, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment relates to goodwill arising from the Company's
purchase of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation ("AHL") in 1999 and Pembridge, Inc. in 1998 and is the result of the Company adopting the fair value-based approach to
goodwill impairment testing required by SFAS No. 142.

The
Company annually tests goodwill for impairment and uses several widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and market multiple and trading multiple
analyses, to estimate the fair value of its SFAS No. 142 reporting units. Goodwill impairment testing indicated no


impairment
at December 31, 2003. In 2003, the Company's reporting units changed as a result of further integration of previously acquired businesses.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Included in property and equipment are capitalized costs related to computer software
licenses and software developed for internal use. These costs generally consist of certain external, payroll and payroll related costs. Property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 10 years for equipment and 40 years for real property. Certain facilities and equipment
held under capital and synthetic leases are classified as property and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the lease terms with the related obligations recorded as
liabilities. Lease amortization is included in depreciation expense included in operating costs and expenses. Accumulated depreciation on property and equipment was $1.37 billion and
$1.26 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $225 million, $205 million, and $201 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company reviews its property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable.

Income taxes

The income tax provision is calculated under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. The principal assets and liabilities giving rise to such differences are unrealized capital gains and losses on certain
investments, insurance reserves, unearned premiums, deferred policy acquisition costs and employee benefits. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established when there is uncertainty that such
assets would be realized.

Separate Accounts

The Company issues variable annuities, variable life insurance contracts and certain GICs, the assets and liabilities of which are legally segregated and recorded
as assets and liabilities of the separate accounts. The assets of the separate accounts are carried at fair value. Separate accounts liabilities represent the contractholders' claims to the related
assets and are carried at the fair value of the assets. Investment income and realized capital gains and losses of the separate accounts accrue directly to the contractholders and therefore, are not
included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenues to the Company from the separate accounts consist of contract charges for maintenance and administration services, mortality,
early surrender and expenses and are reflected in life and annuity premiums and contract charges. Deposits to the separate accounts are not included in consolidated cash flows.

Absent
any contract provision wherein the Company guarantees either a minimum return or account value upon death or annuitization, variable annuity and variable life insurance
contractholders bear the investment risk that the separate accounts' funds may not meet their stated investment objectives.

Reserves for property liability insurance claims and claims expense and life-contingent contract benefits

The reserve for property-liability claims and claims expense is the estimated amount necessary to settle both reported and unreported claims of insured
property-liability losses, based upon the facts in


each
case and the Company's experience with similar cases. Estimated amounts of salvage and subrogation are deducted from the reserve for claims and claims expense. The establishment of appropriate
reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain process. Reserve estimates are regularly reviewed and updated, using the most current information available. Any resulting
reestimates are reflected in current operations (see Note 7).

The
reserve for life-contingent contract benefits, which relates to traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies, is computed on the basis of
long-term actuarial assumptions as to future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, terminations and expenses. These assumptions, which for traditional life insurance are applied using
the net level premium method, include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. Detailed reserve assumptions
and reserve interest rates are outlined in Note 8. To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities would result in a premium deficiency had those gains actually been realized,
the related increase in reserves for certain immediate annuities with life contingencies is recorded net of tax as a reduction of the unrealized net capital gains included in accumulated other
comprehensive income.

Contractholder funds

Contractholder funds arise from the issuance of interest-sensitive life policies and investment contracts and from net deposits of Allstate Bank, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. Deposits received are recorded as interest-bearing liabilities. Contractholder funds are equal to deposits received and interest credited to the benefit of the
contractholder less surrenders and withdrawals, mortality charges and administrative expenses. Detailed information on crediting rates and surrender and withdrawal provisions on contractholder funds
are outlined in Note 8.

Deferred compensation expense

Deferred compensation expense represents the remaining unrecognized cost of shares acquired by the Allstate Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") to
pre-fund a portion of the Company's contribution to The Savings and Profit Sharing Plan of Allstate Employees and the unrecognized cost associated with the restricted shares granted under
equity incentive plans for Allstate employees (see Note 17). A detailed description of the ESOP and the impacts on the consolidated financial statements is included in Note 16.

Off-balance-sheet financial instruments

Commitments to invest, commitments to purchase private placement securities, commitments to extend mortgage loans, financial guarantees and credit guarantees have
off-balance-sheet risk because their contractual amounts are not recorded in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The contractual amounts and fair values of these
instruments are outlined in Note 6.

Foreign currency translation

The local currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is deemed to be the functional currency in which these subsidiaries operate. The financial statements of
the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates during the
period for results of operations. The unrealized gains and losses from the translation of the net assets are recorded as unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments and included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Changes in unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments are


included
in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in operating costs and expenses and have not been significant.

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on weighted
average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. For Allstate, dilutive potential common shares consist of outstanding stock options.

The
computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, are presented in the following table.

Options to purchase 8.7 million, 9.0 million, and 9.2 million Allstate common shares, with exercise prices ranging from $36.99 to $50.72,

inclusion of those options would have an anti-dilutive effect as the options' exercise prices exceeded the average market price of Allstate common shares in those years.


Adopted accounting standards

Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 148")

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 which amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation". The amendment enabled
companies that choose to adopt the fair value based method to report the full effect of employee stock options in their financial statements immediately upon adoption. The statement sets forth clearer
and more prominent disclosures about the cost of employee stock options and increased the frequency of those disclosures to include publication in quarterly financial statements. Beginning
January 1, 2003, the Company began expensing the fair value of all stock options granted on or after January 1, 2003. The Company recognized $9 million, after-tax,
expense associated with stock options granted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003.

FASB Interpretation No. 46 and 46R, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46" and "FIN 46R")

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, which addressed whether certain types of entities, referred to as variable interest entities ("VIEs"),
should be consolidated in a company's financial statements. A VIE is an entity in which the equity investors lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest or that lacks
sufficient equity to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities. A company must consolidate a VIE if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the
expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity's expected returns, or both.

In
December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R to clarify and revise a number of key elements of FIN 46 including the definition of a VIE and the treatment of fees paid
to decision makers.

The
application of FIN 46 was required for VIEs created on or after February 1, 2003. For VIEs existing prior to that date, the effective date of the interpretation was
delayed through the issuance of FASB Staff Position ("FSP") FIN 46-6, until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after December 15, 2003. However, the early
adoption of FIN 46 was permitted for some or all of a reporting entity's affected VIEs. The adoption of FIN 46R is required by the end of the first reporting period ending after
December 15, 2003 for VIEs considered to be special-purpose entities.

The
Company elected to adopt FIN 46 as of July 1, 2003 for its existing VIEs with the exception of two VIEs used to manage assets on behalf of unrelated third party
investors. FIN 46 was adopted as of December 31, 2003 for those remaining VIEs subsequent to the issuance of FIN 46R.

The
impact of adopting FIN 46 as of July 1, 2003 for certain VIEs was as follows:

•

The
Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE used to acquire a headquarters office building and up to 38 automotive collision repair stores resulting in
the consolidation of this VIE as of July 1, 2003. The initial impact of consolidation was to increase property and equipment, net and long-term debt by $102 million in the
third quarter of 2003. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, payments to the VIE previously reported as operating costs and expenses were classified as interest expense.

•

The
Company issues funding agreements to a Special Purpose Entity ("SPE") (which is considered a VIE under FIN 46) used to issue Global Medium Term Notes ("GMTNs") to
unrelated third parties. The GMTNs and certain equity interests issued by the SPE, to the extent they are exposed to all the risks and rewards of owning the funding agreements that collateralize


the
GMTNs, are considered variable interests in a VIE. Because the Company owns none of the variable interests issued by the VIE, it is not required to consolidate the VIE and will continue to
classify funding agreements issued to the VIE as a component of contractholder funds.

•

Consistent
with the GMTN program, the Company's Euro Medium Term Notes ("EMTNs") program no longer requires consolidation. The impact of deconsolidating the EMTNs was
the recognition of the funding agreements issued to the VIE as a component of contractholder funds, which is consistent with the previous accounting for this program.

•

The
Company issued junior subordinated debentures ("debentures") to a VIE which used the debentures as collateral to issue $200 million of mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities of subsidiary trust ("trust preferred securities") to unrelated third party investors. Because the Company owns none of the variable interests issued by the VIE it is not required
to consolidate the VIE. The sole assets of the VIE are the debentures issued by the Company with repayment terms identical to the trust preferred securities. Previously, the trust preferred securities
were reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust and the dividends were reported in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations as dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust. The impact of deconsolidation was to increase long-term debt and decrease mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
of subsidiary trust by $200 million. Beginning in the third quarter of 2003, interest on the junior debentures was recognized as interest expense and the Company no longer reported dividends on
preferred securities of subsidiary trust.

•

The
Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of a previously unconsolidated investment transaction considered to be a VIE under FIN 46. Accordingly, the
VIE was consolidated as of July 1, 2003. As a result of consolidating the investment transaction, the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2003 included
$50 million of assets classified as investments and long-term debt of $44 million. The holders of the consolidated long-term debt have no recourse to the equity
of the Company as the sole source of payment of the liabilities is the assets of the VIE.

•

The
issuance of FIN 46R had no impact on the initial application of FIN 46 to the VIEs described above.

The
impact of applying FIN 46R as of December 31, 2003 for the remaining VIEs was as follows:

•

The
Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of two previously unconsolidated VIEs used to hold assets under the management of an affiliate on behalf of
third-party investors ("investment management VIEs"). Accordingly, the investment management VIEs were consolidated as of December 31, 2003. As a result, the Company recognized a cumulative
effect adjustment gain of approximately $3 million, after-tax. In addition, the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2003 includes
$725 million of assets ($663 million of which are classified as investments) and long-term debt of $691 million. Despite the consolidation of the debt issued by the
investment management VIEs, those investors have no recourse to the equity of the Company as the sole source of payment of the liabilities is the assets of the investment management VIEs. Allstate's
maximum loss exposure related to its investment in the investment management VIEs is the current carrying value of its equity investment, which totaled $12 million at December 31, 2003.
The impact to the Company's debt-to-equity ratio from the consolidation of these investment management VIEs is an increase of approximately 3.4 percentage points. This
increase does not affect the Company's compliance with existing debt covenants.


Subsequent
to December 31, 2003 the Company disposed of a portion of its equity investment in one of the consolidated investment management VIEs. This action triggered, under
FIN 46R, a reconsideration of whether the Company remains the primary beneficiary of the VIE. After such reconsideration, the Company determined it is no longer the primary beneficiary of the
affected investment management VIE, and accordingly, this VIE will be deconsolidated as of the disposition date in the first quarter of 2004.

SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 149")

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, which amends, clarifies and codifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and used for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. While this statement applies primarily to certain derivative contracts
and embedded derivatives entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, it also codifies conclusions previously reached by the FASB at various dates on certain implementation issues. The impact
of adopting the provisions of the statement was not material to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations or Financial Position.

Derivatives Implementation Group Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. B36, "Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That
Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor under Those Instruments"("Implementation Issue B36")

In April 2003, the FASB issued Implementation Issue B36, which became effective October 1, 2003. Implementation Issue B36 was applied
to one of the Company's modified coinsurance agreements, and as a result, the embedded derivative was bifurcated from the agreement and marked to market value at October 1, 2003. The effect of
adopting Implementation Issue B36 was the recognition of a loss of $17 million, after-tax, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on
the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Pending accounting standards

Statement of Position 03-01, "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for
Separate Accounts" ("SOP No. 03-01")

In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 03-01, which applies to several of the Company's
insurance products and product features. The effective date of the SOP is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2003. A provision of the SOP requires the establishment of reserves in
addition to the account balance for contracts containing certain features that provide guaranteed death or other insurance benefits and guaranteed income benefits. These reserves are not currently
established by the Company. Recently, the Company implemented new actuarial models that permitted determination of the estimated impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Based on the
Company's application of the estimation methodologies set forth in the SOP, the estimated after-tax impact of adopting the SOP on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, including the
related impact on deferred acquisition costs, is in the range of $150 million to $200 million as of January 1, 2004, based on market conditions that existed at December 31,
2003.


FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1—Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 ("FSP FAS 106-1")

In January 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-1 to address the accounting implications of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 ("Act"). The Act, which was signed into law on December 8, 2003, provides, among other things, a federal subsidy to plan sponsors who maintain postretirement health
care plans ("plans") that provide prescription drug benefits and meet certain equivalency qualifications. Approximately 40% of the Company's $1.16 billion post-retirement benefits
obligation relates to prescription drug benefits for individuals who are over 65 years of age; however, it is uncertain as to the number of covered retiree groups that would meet the
equivalency qualifications of the Act. Because the Company's measurement date occurred prior to the Act being signed, the Company would not recognize the impact to postretirement benefit costs until
2004. The FSP allows reporting entities to make a one-time election to defer recognizing the impact of the Act on its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation ("APBO") determined in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 106, "Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" until sufficient guidance is developed to allow reporting entities to determine
both qualification for the subsidy and how to recognize the impact of the subsidy on its APBO or net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The Company has elected to defer recognition of the
accounting impact of the Act as information was not available to determine with sufficient certainty whether the Company's plans meet the equivalency criteria, and if so, how to recognize the impact
of the subsidy on its APBO or net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The Company is currently unable to determine the impact of the Act, which may be material, on its APBO or net periodic
postretirement benefits cost.

Proposed accounting standards

Emerging Issues Task Force Topic No. 03-01, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments" ("EITF No. 03-01")

The Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") is currently deliberating EITF No. 03-01, which attempts to define
other-than-temporary impairment and highlight its application to investment securities accounted for under both SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities" ("SFAS No. 115") and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stocks" ("APB No. 18"). The
current issue summary, which has yet to be finalized, proposes that if, at the evaluation date, the fair value of an investment security is less than its carrying value then an impairment exists for
which a determination must be made as to whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. If it is determined that an impairment is other-than-temporary,
then an impairment loss should be recognized equal to the difference between the investment's carrying value and its fair value at the reporting date. In recent deliberations, the EITF discussed
different models to assess whether impairment is other-than-temporary for different types of investments (e.g. SFAS No. 115 marketable equity securities, SFAS
No. 115 debt securities, and equity and cost method investments subject to APB No. 18) and subsequently decided to use a unified model. Due to the uncertainty of the final model (or
models) that may be adopted, the estimated impact to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Financial Position is presently not determinable. In November 2003, the EITF reached
a consensus with respect to certain disclosures effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures are required for fixed income and marketable
equity securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under SFAS No. 115. The Company has included those disclosures at
December 31, 2003 (see Note 5).


3.     Acquisitions and Dispositions

2003 dispositions

The Company announced its intention to exit the Allstate Financial direct response distribution business. Based on its decision to sell the business, the Company
recorded an estimated loss on the disposition of $44 million ($29 million, after-tax). An agreement was entered with American Health and Life Insurance Company and Triton
Insurance Company, subsidiaries of
Citigroup Inc., to dispose of a portion of the direct response business. If approved by the state insurance departments, the transaction will be effective January 1, 2004.

2002 dispositions

The Company disposed of Allstate Investments, K.K., a non-operating company domiciled in Japan. As a result, the Company recognized a
$7 million gain ($5 million after-tax) on the disposition and a $14 million tax benefit, not previously recognized, attributable to the
inception-to-date losses of the subsidiary. The tax benefit was reported as a reduction to the Company's income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The
Company disposed of its remaining interest in Saison Automobile and Fire Insurance, a Japanese joint venture. As a result, the Company recognized a $2 million gain
($1 million after-tax) on the disposition.

The
Company entered into an agreement to dispose of its interest in Ivory Holdings, LLC in 2003. As a result, the Company recognized a $4 million loss ($2 million
after-tax) on the disposition.

The
Company approved the disposal of its direct response long-term care business through a reinsurance transaction. As a result, the Company recognized a $3 million
loss ($2 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying value of the long-term care business to its fair value.

2001 dispositions

The Company disposed of its operations in Indonesia and the Philippines through a sale and purchase agreement with The Prudential Assurance Company Limited
("Prudential"), where Prudential acquired Allstate's holdings in Pt Asuransi Jiwa Allstate, Indonesia and Allstate Life Insurance Company of the Philippines. Allstate recognized a loss on the
dispositions of $10 million ($6 million after-tax) and a $3 million tax benefit, not previously recognized, attributable to the
inception-to-date losses of the subsidiaries. The tax benefit was reported as a reduction to the Company's income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The
Company completed the disposition of its direct auto insurance business in Germany and Italy to Direct Line, the London based insurance subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland. As a
result, the Company recognized a $53 million ($34 million after-tax) loss on the disposition and a $47 million tax benefit, not previously recognized, attributable to
the inception-to-date losses of the subsidiaries. The tax benefit was reported as a reduction to the Company's income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

2001 acquisitions

The Company acquired blocks of business from American Maturity Life Insurance Company ("AML") via coinsurance contracts. Pursuant to the terms of
the coinsurance contracts, the Company assumed: variable annuities, market value adjusted annuities, equity-indexed annuities, fixed annuities and immediate annuities. The Company received assets
consisting primarily of cash, investments and


accrued
investment income with a fair value equal to the corresponding assumed reserves for life-contingent benefits and contractholder funds resulting in no goodwill.

The
Company acquired Provident National Assurance Company ("PNAC"), a broadly licensed inactive company that maintains authority to sell life insurance and variable annuity products in
most states, from UnumProvident Corporation. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of PNAC's net assets acquired of
$5 million was recorded as goodwill. The Company paid consideration of $14 million as part of the acquisition. PNAC's name was subsequently changed to Allstate Assurance Company, which
was redomiciled in the State of Illinois.

The
Company completed the acquisition of Sterling Collision Centers, Inc. ("Sterling"). Sterling operates a network of 48 collision repair stores in ten states and fourteen
metropolitan areas. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of Sterling's net assets acquired of $90 million was recorded as
goodwill. The Company paid consideration of $79 million as part of the acquisition.

The
Company acquired a 51% interest in Ivory Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the excess of the purchase price
over the net assets acquired of $5 million was recorded as goodwill. The Company paid consideration of $4 million as part of the acquisition.

The
Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of USF&G Business Insurance Company ("USF&G"), a Maryland property and casualty insurance company. The transaction was accounted for
as a purchase and the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired of $2 million was recorded as goodwill. The Company paid consideration of $11 million as part of the
acquisition. USF&G's name was subsequently changed to Encompass Insurance Company, which was redomiciled in the State of Illinois.

4.     Supplemental Cash Flow Information

Non-cash investment exchanges and modifications, which primarily reflect refinancings of fixed income securities and mergers completed with equity
securities, totaled $56 million, $137 million and $378 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The
adoption of FIN 46 resulted in the consolidation of various VIEs causing increases in assets of $877 million and long-term debt of $1.04 billion. See
further discussion of the impacts of adopting FIN 46 in Note 2.

Portfolio monitoring

Inherent in the Company's evaluation of a particular security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential.
Some of the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary are: 1) the Company's ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time
sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; 2) the recoverability of principal and interest; 3) the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for
equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities; 4) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, including relevant industry
conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; and 5) the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position, including market
conditions which could affect access to liquidity.

The
following table summarizes the gross unrealized losses and fair value of fixed income and equity securities by the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous
unrealized loss position at December 31, 2003:

The above table includes $290 million of unrealized losses related to securities with an unrealized loss position less than 20% of cost or amortized cost,
[the degree of which suggests that these securities do not pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired]. Of
the $290 million, $234 million relate to unrealized losses on investment grade fixed income securities. Investment grade is defined as a security having a rating from the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") of 1 or 2; a Moody's equivalent rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa; a Standard & Poor's ("S&P") equivalent rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB; or a comparable
internal rating. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities are principally related to changes in interest rates or changes in issuer and sector related credit spreads since the securities were
acquired.

The
remaining $98 million of unrealized losses relate to securities in unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to 20% of cost or amortized cost. Of the $98 million,
$28 million relate to investment grade fixed income securities, $61 million relate to below investment grade fixed income securities and $9 million relate to equity securities. Of
these amounts $10 million, $31 million and $1 million, respectively, had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of twelve months or more as of December 31, 2003.
$13 million of the unrealized losses from below investment grade securities are airline industry issues. The securities comprising the $98 million of unrealized losses were evaluated
considering factors such as the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer


and
were determined to have adequate resources to fulfill contractual obligations, such as recent financings or bank loans, cash flows from operations, collateral or the position of a subsidiary with
respect to its parent's bankruptcy.

As
of December 31, 2003, the Company had the intent and ability to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient for them to recover in value.

Mortgage loan impairment

A mortgage loan is impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement.

The
net carrying value of impaired loans at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was comprised of loans in foreclosure and delinquent loans of $4 million and $11 million,
respectively. There were no restructured loans at December 31, 2003 and 2002. No valuation allowances were established for impaired loans because the impaired loans are collateral dependent
loans and the fair value of the collateral was greater than the recorded investment in the loans.

Interest
income for impaired loans is recognized on an accrual basis if payments are expected to continue to be received; otherwise cash basis is used. For impaired loans that have been
restructured,
interest is accrued based on the principal amount at the adjusted interest rate. The Company recognized interest income of $2 million on impaired loans during 2003 and $1 million on
impaired loans during both 2002 and 2001. The average balance of impaired loans was $23 million, $16 million and $29 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

There
were no valuation allowances for mortgage loans at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Direct write-downs of mortgage loan gross carrying amounts were $3 million,
$5 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, net reductions to
mortgage loan valuation allowances were $0 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively.

In 2003, $259 million of commercial mortgage loans were contractually due. Of these, 97% were paid as due and 3% were refinanced at prevailing market
terms. None were foreclosed or in the process of foreclosure, and none were in the process of refinancing or restructuring discussions.

Included
in fixed income securities are below investment grade assets totaling $6.01 billion and $5.41 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Consolidation of two investment management VIEs contributed $650 million to the increase for the year (see Note 2).

At
December 31, 2003, the carrying value of investments, excluding equity securities, that were non-income producing during 2003 was $33 million.

At
December 31, 2003, fixed income securities with a carrying value of $313 million were on deposit with regulatory authorities as required by law.


Securities lending

The Company participates in securities lending programs, primarily for investment yield enhancement purposes, with third parties, mostly large brokerage firms. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, fixed income securities with a carrying value of $2.16 billion and $2.43 billion, respectively, were on loan under these agreements. In return, the
Company receives cash that it invests and includes in short-term investments and fixed income securities, with an offsetting liability recorded in other liabilities and accrued expenses to
account for the Company's obligation to return the collateral. Interest income on collateral, net of fees, was $6 million, $9 million and $13 million, for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

6.     Financial Instruments

In the normal course of business, the Company invests in various financial assets, incurs various financial liabilities and enters into agreements involving
derivative financial instruments and other off-balance-sheet financial instruments. The fair value estimates of financial instruments presented below are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts the Company might pay or receive in actual market transactions. Potential taxes and other transaction costs have not been considered in estimating fair value. The disclosures that follow do
not reflect the fair value of the Company as a whole since a number of the Company's significant assets (including DAC, property and equipment, net and reinsurance recoverables, net) and liabilities
(including reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, reserve for life-contingent contract benefits and deferred income taxes) are not considered financial
instruments and are not carried at fair value. Other assets and liabilities considered financial instruments such as premium installment receivables, accrued investment income, cash and claim payments
outstanding are generally of a short-term nature. Their carrying values are deemed to approximate fair value.

Fair values of publicly traded fixed income securities are based upon quoted market prices or dealer quotes. The fair value of non-publicly traded
securities, primarily privately placed corporate obligations, is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models, which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data
(e.g., term structures and current publicly traded bond prices) as inputs, or independent third party pricing sources. Equity securities are valued based principally on quoted market prices. Mortgage
loans are valued based on discounted contractual cash flows. Discount rates are selected using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar characteristics, using
similar properties as collateral. Loans that exceed 100% loan-to-value are valued at the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. Short-term investments
are highly liquid investments with maturities of less than one year whose carrying values are deemed to approximate fair value. The carrying value of policy loans is deemed to approximate fair value.
Separate accounts assets are carried in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value based on quoted market prices.

Contractholder funds include interest-sensitive life insurance contracts and investment contracts. Interest-sensitive life insurance contracts are not considered
financial instruments subject to fair value disclosure requirements. The fair value of investment contracts is based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Fixed annuities, immediate annuities
without life contingencies, GICs and funding agreements are valued at the account balance less surrender charges. Market value adjusted annuities' fair value is estimated to be the market adjusted
surrender value. Equity-indexed annuity contracts' fair value approximates carrying value since the embedded equity options are carried at market value in the consolidated financial statements.

Short-term
debt is valued at carrying value due to its short-term nature. The fair value of long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trust is based on quoted market prices or, in certain cases, is determined using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates of comparable instruments. Security
repurchase agreements are valued at carrying value due to their short-term nature. Separate accounts liabilities are carried at the fair value of the underlying assets.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company primarily uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to market risk (principally interest rate, equity price and foreign currency
risk) and in conjunction with asset/liability management in its Allstate Financial segment. The Company does not buy, sell or hold these instruments for trading purposes.

Carrying
value includes the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Fair value and carrying value of the assets and liabilities exclude accrued periodic settlements,
which are reported in accrued investment income.

The
notional amounts specified in the contracts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual payments under the agreements, and are not representative of the potential for gain or
loss on these agreements.

Fair
value, which is equal to the carrying value, is the estimated amount that the Company would receive (pay) to terminate the derivative contracts at the reporting date. For exchange
traded derivative contracts, the fair value is based on dealer or exchange quotes. The fair value of non-exchange traded derivative contracts, including embedded derivative financial
instruments subject to bifurcation, is based


on
either independent third party pricing sources or widely accepted pricing and valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs.

The
Company manages its exposure to credit risk by utilizing highly rated counterparties, establishing risk control limits, executing legally enforceable master netting agreements and
obtaining collateral where appropriate. The Company uses master netting agreements for
over-the-counter derivative transactions, including interest rate swap, foreign currency swap, interest rate cap, interest rate floor and credit default swap agreements. These
agreements permit either party to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements. Under the provisions of the agreements, collateral is either pledged or obtained when certain
predetermined exposure limits are exceeded. As of December 31, 2003, counterparties pledged $333 million in cash to the Company under these agreements. To date, the Company has not
incurred any losses on derivative financial instruments due to counterparty nonperformance. Other derivatives including futures and certain option contracts are traded on organized exchanges, which
require margin deposits and guarantee the execution of trades, thereby mitigating any associated potential credit risk.

Credit
exposure represents the Company's potential loss if all of the counterparties failed to perform under the contractual terms of the contracts and all collateral, if any, became
worthless. This exposure is measured by the fair value of freestanding derivative contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date reduced by the effect, if any, of master netting
agreements.

The
following table summarizes the counterparty credit exposure by counterparty credit rating at December 31, as it relates to interest rate swap, currency swap, interest rate
cap, interest rate floor and credit default swap agreements.

For
each counterparty, only over-the-counter derivatives with a net positive market value are included.

Market
risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk exists for all of the derivative financial instruments the
Company currently holds, as these instruments may become less valuable due to adverse changes in market conditions. To limit this risk, the Company's senior management has established risk control
limits. In addition, changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments that the Company uses for risk management purposes are generally offset by the change in the fair value or cash flows
of the hedged risk component of the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions.


The Company reclassified pretax net gains of $3 million and $4 million related to cash flow hedges to net income from accumulated other
comprehensive income during 2003 and 2002, respectively. An estimated $1 million of pretax net losses will be released from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income during 2004.

The
following table presents information about the nature and accounting treatment of Allstate's primary derivative instruments. Included in the table is a description of the individual

Interest Rate Contracts:

Interest rate swap agreements

Description

Swap agreements are contracts that periodically exchange the difference between two designated sets of cash flows, (fixed to variable rate, variable to fixed rate, or variable to variable rate) based upon designated market rates or rate indices and a
notional amount.

Master netting agreements are used to minimize credit risk. In addition, when applicable, parties are required to post collateral. As of December 31, 2003, the Company pledged to counterparties $0.4 million of securities as collateral for
over-the-counter instruments.

based on a pre-determined notional amount.

Risk Management Strategies

These agreements are entered into primarily to manage the foreign currency risk associated with issuing foreign currency denominated funding agreements. In addition to hedging foreign currency risk, they may also change the interest rate
characteristics of the funding agreements for asset-liability management purposes.

Except for credit guarantees, the contractual amounts represent the amount at risk if the contract is fully drawn upon, the counterparty defaults and the value of
any underlying security becomes worthless. Unless noted otherwise, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support off-balance-sheet financial instruments with credit
risk.

Commitments
to invest generally represent commitments to acquire financial interests or instruments. The Company enters into these agreements to allow for additional participation in
certain limited partnership investments. Because the equity investments in the limited partnerships are not actively traded, it is not practical to estimate the fair value of these commitments.

Private
placement commitments represent conditional commitments to purchase private placement debt and equity securities at a specified future date. The Company regularly enters into
these agreements in the normal course of business. The fair value of these commitments generally cannot be estimated on the date the commitment is made as the terms and conditions of the underlying
private placement securities are not yet final.

Commitments
to extend mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a borrower provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. The Company enters these agreements
to commit to future loan fundings at a predetermined interest rate. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Commitments to extend mortgage loans, which are
secured by the underlying properties, are valued based on estimates of fees charged by other institutions to make similar commitments to similar borrowers.

Credit
guarantees represent conditional commitments included in certain fixed income securities owned by the Company. These commitments provide for obligations to exchange credit risk or
to forfeit principal due, depending on the nature or occurrence of credit events for the referenced entities. The Company enters into these transactions in order to achieve higher yields than direct
investment in referenced entities. The fees for assuming the conditional commitments are reflected in the interest receipts reported in net investment income over the lives of the contracts. The fair
value of credit guarantees are estimates of the conditional commitments only and are calculated using quoted market prices or valuation models, which incorporate external market data.

In
the event of bankruptcy or other default of the referenced entities, the Company's maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of the referenced credits becomes worthless, is the fair
value of the subject fixed income securities, which totaled $87 million at December 31, 2003. The Company includes the impact of credit guarantees in its analysis of credit risk, and the
referenced credits were current to their contractual terms at December 31, 2003.

7.     Reserve for Property-Liability Insurance Claims and Claims Expense

As described in Note 2, the Company establishes reserves for claims and claims expense on reported and unreported claims of insured losses. These reserve
estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances and internal factors including the Company's experience with similar cases, historical trends involving claim payment patterns,
loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, the reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including law changes, court decisions,
changes to regulatory requirements, economic conditions, and public attitudes. The Company, in the normal course of business, may also supplement its claims processes by utilizing third party
adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are
implicitly considered in the reserving process.


Because
reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred, including incurred but not reported ("IBNR") losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for
catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on management's best estimates. Allstate regularly
updates its reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be
material, are reflected in the results of operations in the period such changes are determinable.

Activity
in the reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense is summarized as follows:

Incurred claims and claims expense represents the sum of paid losses and reserve changes in the calendar year. This expense includes losses from catastrophes of
$1.49 billion, $731 million and $894 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the property-liability insurance business that have
contributed to, and will continue to contribute to, material year-to-year fluctuations in the Company's results of operations and financial position.

Incurred
claims and claims expense related to prior years is primarily composed of increases to asbestos reserves of $520 million, $121 million, and $94 million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively; decreases in auto reserves of $221 million in 2003, primarily due to improved injury severity and late reported loss developments that were better than
expected, and increases in homeowners reserves of $367 million and $415 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, primarily as a result of claim severity development and late reported
losses greater than the level anticipated in previous reserve estimates.


The level of catastrophic loss and weather-related losses (wind, hail, lightning, freeze and water losses which include mold losses) experienced in any year
cannot be predicted and could be material to results of operations and financial position. For Allstate, areas of potential natural event catastrophe losses due to hurricanes include major
metropolitan centers near the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States. Areas in the United States with exposure to potential earthquake losses included California, areas surrounding the New
Madrid fault system in the Midwest and faults in and surrounding Seattle, Washington and Charleston, South Carolina. Allstate continues to evaluate alternative business strategies to more effectively
manage its exposure to catastrophe losses in these and other areas.

To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities would result in a premium deficiency had those gains actually been realized, a premium deficiency
reserve has been recorded for certain immediate annuities with life contingencies. A liability of $932 million and $797 million is included in the reserve for life-contingent
contract benefits with respect to this deficiency as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The offset to this liability is recorded as a reduction of the unrealized net capital gains
included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Property-liability

Total amounts recoverable from reinsurers at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $1.90 billion and $1.80 billion, respectively. The amounts
recoverable from reinsurers at December 31, 2003 and 2002 include $170 million and $129 million, respectively, related to property-liability losses paid by the Company and billed
to reinsurers, and $1.73 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively, estimated by the Company with respect to ceded unpaid losses (including IBNR), which are not billable until the losses


are
paid. Amounts recoverable from mandatory pools and facilities included in reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims including IBNR were $812 million and $838 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of which $560 million and $589 million, respectively, were recoverable from the Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association ("MCCA"). The
MCCA, established in 1978, is a mandatory reinsurance mechanism for personal injury protection losses over a retention level that increases each MCCA fiscal year. The retention levels are
$300 thousand per claim and $325 thousand per claim for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The MCCA is funded by assessments from member companies who,
in turn, can recover the assessment from policyholders.

The
Company purchases reinsurance after evaluating the financial condition of the reinsurer, as well as the terms and price of coverage. Developments in the insurance industry have
fostered a movement to segregate environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported
these actions. The Company is unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future. The Company had amounts
recoverable from Lloyd's of London of $112 million and $50 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Lloyd's of London implemented a restructuring plan in 1996 to
solidify its capital base and to segregate claims for years prior to 1993. In addition, efforts have been recently made by Lloyd's of London to impose increased documentation standards on reinsurance
claims. The impact, if any, of the restructuring and related actions on the collectibility of the recoverable from Lloyd's of London is uncertain at this time. The recoverable from Lloyd's of London
syndicates is spread among thousands of investors who have unlimited liability.

In
connection with the Company's acquisition of the personal lines auto and homeowners business ("Encompass") of CNA Financial Corporation ("CNA") in 1999, Allstate and Continental
Casualty Company ("Continental"), a subsidiary of CNA, entered into a four-year aggregate stop loss reinsurance agreement. The Company had reinsurance recoverables from Continental on paid
and unpaid losses of $190 million and $219 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, in connection with the reinsurance agreement. The agreement provides for settlement of these
reinsurance recoverables with Continental in 2004.

In
the event of a qualifying catastrophe, the Company also has access to reimbursement provided by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF") for 90% of hurricane losses in excess
of approximately the first $289 million for each storm, up to an aggregate of $719 million (90% of approximately $800 million) in a single hurricane season, and
$1.44 billion total reimbursement over two hurricane seasons. Additionally, in connection with the sale of the Company's reinsurance business to SCOR U.S. Corporation in 1996, the Company
entered into a reinsurance agreement for the associated post-1984 reinsurance liabilities.

With
the exception of mandatory pools and facilities and the recoverable balances from Continental and Lloyd's of London discussed above, the largest reinsurance recoverable balance the
Company had outstanding was $87 million and $91 million from Employers' Reinsurance Company at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No other amount due or estimated to be due
from any single property-liability reinsurer was in excess of $57 million and $60 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The
allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $101 million and $85 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There were $1 million and
$4 million of recoveries of previous year provisions in 2003 and 2002, respectively.


Allstate Financial

The Company's Allstate Financial segment reinsures certain of its risks to other insurers under yearly renewable term, coinsurance, and modified coinsurance
agreements. These agreements result in a passing of the agreed-upon percentage of risk to the reinsurer in exchange for negotiated reinsurance premium payments. Modified coinsurance is
similar to coinsurance except that the cash and investments that support the liability for contract benefits are not transferred to the assuming company and settlements are made on a net basis between
the companies.

Allstate
Financial ceded 90%, 80% or 60% of the mortality risk on certain life policies, depending upon the issue year and product, to a pool of fourteen unaffiliated reinsurers. In
November 1998, Allstate Financial began ceding mortality risk on new business in excess of $2 million per life for individual coverage. For business sold prior to October 1998,
Allstate Financial ceded mortality risk in excess of $1 million per life for individual coverage. As of December 31, 2003, $182.10 billion of life insurance in force was ceded to
other companies. Total amounts recoverable from reinsurers at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $1.22 billion and $1.08 billion, respectively.

In May 2003, the Company issued $400 million of 5.350% senior notes due 2033, the net proceeds of which were used to redeem the $300 million
of 6.75% notes due in 2003 and for general corporate purposes.

In
December 2002, the Company issued $250 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2032, the net proceeds of which were used to redeem all of the 7.125% Debentures due 2097. In
February 2002, the


Company
issued $350 million of 6.125% senior notes due 2012, the net proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes.

Pursuant
to the adoption of FIN 46, the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE used to acquire a headquarters office building and up to 38 automotive collision repair stores
and, as a result, the VIE was consolidated in 2003. The impact of consolidation was to increase property and equipment, net and long-term debt by $112 million. Payments previously
reported as operating costs and expenses are classified as interest expense.

The
Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of two previously unconsolidated VIEs used to hold assets under the management of an affiliate on behalf of third-party investors
("investment management VIEs"). Accordingly, the investment management VIEs were consolidated as of December 31, 2003 resulting in an increase to long-term debt of
$691 million.

The
Company also determined it is the primary beneficiary of a previously unconsolidated structured investment security considered a VIE under FIN 46. As a result, the VIE was
consolidated in 2003 resulting in an increase in debt of $45 million in the 2003 consolidated financial statements.

Additionally,
the Company is the primary beneficiary of Allstate Financing II ("AF II"), a VIE, that issued $200 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trust ("trust preferred securities"). AF II issued 200,000 shares of 7.83% trust preferred securities at $1,000 per share. The Company does not own any of the trust preferred
securities which were issued to unrelated third parties and are considered the principal variable interests issued by AF II. As a result, the preferred securities which the Company previously
consolidated, are no longer consolidated. The sole assets of AF II are junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. The junior subordinated debentures held by AF II will mature
on December 1, 2045 and are redeemable by the Company at a liquidation
value of $1,039 per share in whole or in part beginning on December 1, 2006, at which time the trust preferred securities are callable. The liquidation value per share gradually declines each
year and remains at a liquidation value of $1,000 per share on December 1, 2016. Dividends on the trust preferred securities are cumulative, payable semi-annually in arrears, and
are deferrable at the Company's option for up to 5 years. Previously, the trust preferred securities were reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities of subsidiary trust and the dividends were reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust. The impact of
deconsolidation was to increase long-term debt and decrease mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust by $200 million.

The
obligations of the Company with respect to the junior subordinated debentures and related instruments constitute full and unconditional guarantees by the Company of AF II's
obligations under the trust preferred securities, including the payment of the liquidation or redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid interest and yield enhancements, but only to the extent of
funds held by the trust.

Allstate
will be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock and any preferred stock that it may issue, or repurchasing capital stock if the Company elects to defer dividend
payments on these preferred securities. Dividends on the preferred securities have been reported as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the last six months of 2003 and
were classified as minority interest and reported as dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary trust in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2002 and the first six months of 2003.


The callable notes and debentures are subject to redemption at the Company's option in whole or in part at any time at the greater of either 100% of the principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date or the discounted sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest and accrued and unpaid interest
to the redemption date.

To
manage short-term liquidity, Allstate can issue commercial paper, draw on its credit facilities, and engage in securities repurchase and resale agreements (see
Note 2). The Company maintains three credit facilities as a potential source of funds for The Allstate Corporation, AIC and ALIC. These include a $575 million five-year
revolving line of credit expiring in 2006, a $575 million 364-day revolving line of credit expiring in 2004, and a $50 million one-year revolving line of credit
expiring in 2004. The right to borrow from the five-year and 364-day lines of credit are subject to requirements customary for facilities of this size, type and purpose. For
example, the Company's debt to consolidated net capital (as defined in the agreement) must not exceed a designated level. No amounts were outstanding under any of these lines of credit during 2003 and
2002. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2003. The Company had commercial paper outstanding of $279 million with a weighted average interest rate of 1.25% at
December 31, 2002.

The
Company paid $269 million, $269 million and $241 million of interest on debt in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The
Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in August 2003, under which up to an additional $2.80 billion of debt
and equity securities, warrants for debt and equity securities, depositary shares representing debt and equity securities, trust preferred securities, and stock purchase contracts and stock purchase
units may be issued.

Capital stock

The Company had 900 million shares of issued common stock of which 704 million were outstanding and 196 million were held in treasury as of
December 31, 2003. In 2003, the Company repurchased 4.2 million
shares at an average cost of $35.68 pursuant to authorized share repurchase programs. At December 31, 2003, there was $1.35 billion remaining on the Company's authorized share repurchase
programs.

Shareholder rights agreement

In 2003, the Company announced it would terminate a Shareholder Rights Agreement and redeemed the "Rights" at a price of $0.01 per Right (approximately
$7 million), payable on January 2, 2004. The Rights Agreement, under which all shareholders received a dividend distribution of one Right on each outstanding share of the Company's
common stock, would have expired on February 12, 2009.

12.   Company Restructuring

Restructuring and related charges include employee termination and relocation benefits, post-exit rent expenses, and a non-cash charge
resulting from pension benefit payments made to agents in connection with the 1999 reorganization of Allstate's multiple agency programs to a single exclusive agency program.

In
2003, the Company completed the restructuring program initiated in 2001 to improve the efficiency of its claims handling and certain other back-office processes primarily
through a consolidation and reconfiguration of field claim offices, customer information centers and satellite offices ("2001 program"). The 2001 program resulted in a reduction of the total number of
field claim


offices
and an increase in the average size of individual claim offices. In addition, two customer information centers and two satellite offices were closed. As part of the 2001 program, employees
working in facilities selected for closure were given the option to either relocate or collect severance benefits. The Company realized approximately $175 million of annual pre-tax
expense savings as a result of implementing the 2001 program.

In
2002, the Company completed its program announced on November 10, 1999 to aggressively expand its selling and service capabilities and reduce current annual expenses by
approximately $600 million. The reduction in expenses was achieved through field realignment, the reorganization of employee agents to a single exclusive agency independent contractor program,
the closing of a field support center and four regional offices, and reduced employee related expenses and professional services as a result of reductions in force, attrition and consolidations.

As
a result of the 1999 program, Allstate established a $69 million restructuring liability during the fourth quarter of 1999 for certain employee termination costs and qualified
exit costs. Additionally, during 2001, an additional $96 million was accrued in connection with the 2001 program for certain employee termination costs and qualified exit costs.

The

13.   Commitments, Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities

Leases

The Company leases certain office facilities and computer equipment. Total rent expense for all leases was $367 million, $425 million and
$472 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

California Earthquake Authority

Exposure to certain potential losses from earthquakes in California is limited by the Company's participation in the California Earthquake Authority ("CEA"),
which provides insurance for California earthquake losses. The CEA is a privately-financed, publicly-managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage. Insurers selling
homeowners insurance in California are required to offer earthquake insurance to their customers either through their company or by participation in the CEA. The Company's homeowners policies continue
to include coverages for losses caused by explosions, theft, glass breakage and fires following an earthquake, which are not underwritten by the CEA.

Should
losses arising from an earthquake cause a deficit in the CEA, additional funding would be obtained through assessments on participating insurance companies, reinsurance proceeds
and bond issuances funded by future policyholder assessments. Participating insurers are required to pay an assessment, currently estimated not to exceed $2.18 billion, if the capital of the
CEA falls below $350 million. Participating insurers are required to pay a second assessment, currently estimated not to exceed $1.46 billion, if aggregate CEA earthquake losses exceed
$5.55 billion and the capital of the CEA falls below $350 million. At December 31, 2003, the CEA's capital balance was approximately $1.48 billion. If the CEA assesses its
member insurers for any amount, the amount of future assessments on members is reduced by the amounts previously assessed. To date, the only assessment made by the CEA has been its initial assessment
paid by participating insurers beginning in 1996. The authority of the CEA to assess participating insurers for the first assessment expires when it has completed twelve years of operation, at
year-end 2008. All future assessments on participating CEA insurers are based on their CEA insurance market share as of December 31 of the preceding year. As of December 31,
2003, the Company's share of the CEA was 23%. Allstate does not expect its CEA market share to materially change. At this level, the Company's maximum possible CEA assessment would be
$837 million. However, Allstate does not expect its portion of these additional contingent assessments, if any, to exceed $502 million, its share of the first assessment. This is based
on the low likelihood of an event exceeding the CEA claims paying capacity of $5.55 billion, and therefore the


need
for a second assessment is remote. Management believes Allstate's exposure to earthquake losses in California has been significantly reduced as a result of its participation in the CEA.

Florida hurricane assessments

Allstate Floridian Insurance Company ("Floridian") and Allstate Floridian Indemnity Company ("AFI") sell and service Allstate's Florida residential property
policies and have access to reimbursements on certain qualifying Florida hurricanes, as well as exposure to assessments from the FHCF.

The
FHCF has the authority to issue bonds to pay its obligations to participating insurers, which are funded by assessments on all property and casualty premiums in the state, except
accident and health insurance. These assessments are limited to 4% of premiums per year beginning the first year in which reimbursements require bonding, and up to a total of 6% of premiums per year
for assessments in the second and subsequent years, if required to fund additional bonding. Insurers may recoup assessments immediately through increases in policyholder rates. A rate filing or any
portion of a rate change attributable entirely to an assessment is deemed approved when made with the State of Florida Department of Insurance (the "Department"), subject to the Department's statutory
authority to review the "adequacy" of any rate at any time.

In
addition, Floridian and AFI are subject to assessments from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ("Citizens"), which was created by the state of Florida to provide insurance to
property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market. Citizens can levy a Regular Assessment on participating companies for a deficit in any calendar year equal to the greater of
10% of the deficit or 10% of Florida property premiums industry-wide for the prior year. An insurer may recoup a Regular Assessment through a surcharge to policyholders subject to a cap on
the amount that can be charged in any one year. If a deficit remains after the Regular Assessment, Citizens can also fund the remaining deficit by issuing bonds. The costs of these bonds are then
funded through Emergency Assessments in subsequent years. Companies are required to collect the Emergency Assessments directly from residential property policyholders and remit them to Citizens as
they are collected. Participating companies are obligated to purchase any unsold bonds issued by Citizens. In order to recoup its Citizens assessment, an insurer must file for a policy surcharge with
the Department at least 15 days prior to imposing the surcharge on policies.

While
facilities such as the FHCF and Citizens are designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders, the exposure to assessments and the availability of recoveries from these
facilities may not offset each other. Moreover, even if they do offset each other, they may not offset each other in the same fiscal period's financial statements. This would be due to the ultimate
timing of the assessments and recoupments, as well as the possibility of policies not being renewed in subsequent years.

Other hurricane exposure

The Company has also mitigated its ultimate exposure to hurricanes through policy brokering; examples include the Company's brokering of insurance coverage in
areas of Florida where Floridian and AFI do not write homeowners insurance and in Hawaii for hurricane insurance coverage to a non-affiliated company.

Shared markets

As a condition of maintaining its licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, the Company is required to participate in assigned
risk plans, reinsurance facilities and


joint
underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting
results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to the results of operations.

Guaranty funds

Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, for certain obligations of insolvent
insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The Company's policy is to accrue assessments as the related written premium upon which the assessment is based is written. The Company's expenses
related to these funds have totaled $61 million, $38 million and $52 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

PMI runoff support agreement

The Company has certain limited rights and obligations under a capital support agreement ("Runoff Support Agreement") with PMI Mortgage Insurance Company ("PMI"),
the primary operating subsidiary of PMI Group. Under the Runoff Support Agreement, the Company would be required to pay claims on PMI policies written prior to October 28, 1994 if PMI fails
certain financial covenants and fails to pay such claims. In the event any amounts are so paid, the Company would receive a commensurate amount of preferred stock or subordinated debt of PMI Group or
PMI. The Runoff Support Agreement also restricts PMI's ability to write new business and pay dividends under certain circumstances. Management does not believe this agreement will have a material
adverse effect on results of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Company.

Guarantees

The Company provides residual value guarantees on Company leased automobiles. If all outstanding leases were terminated effective December 31, 2003, the
Company's maximum obligation pursuant to these guarantees, assuming the automobiles have no residual value, would be $19 million at December 31, 2003. The remaining term of each residual
value guarantee is equal to the term of the underlying lease that range from less than one year to three years. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments pursuant to these
guarantees.

The
Company owns certain fixed income securities that obligate the Company to exchange credit risk or to forfeit principal due, depending on the nature or occurrence of specified credit
events for the referenced entities. Additionally, the Company has written credit default swaps that obligate the Company to make a payment upon the occurrence of specified credit events. In the event
all such specified credit events were to occur, the Company's maximum amount at risk on these fixed income securities and written credit default swaps, as measured by the par value and notional value,
respectively, was $132 million at December 31, 2003. The obligations associated with these fixed income securities and written credit default swaps expire at various times during the
next seven years.

Lincoln
Benefit Life Company ("LBL"), a wholly owned subsidiary of ALIC, has issued universal life insurance contracts to third parties who finance the premium payments on
the universal life insurance contracts through a commercial paper program. LBL has issued a repayment guarantee on the outstanding commercial paper balance that is fully collateralized by the cash
surrender value of the universal life insurance contracts. At December 31, 2003, the amount due under the commercial paper program is $300 million and the cash surrender value of the
policies is $306 million. The repayment guarantee expires April 30, 2006.

In
the normal course of business, the Company provides standard indemnifications to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions, including indemnifications for


breaches
of representations and warranties, taxes and certain other liabilities, such as third party lawsuits. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in
the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. The terms of the indemnifications vary in duration and nature. In many cases, the maximum obligation is not
explicitly stated and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur. Because the obligated amounts of the indemnifications are not explicitly
stated in many cases, the maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications is not determinable. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments pursuant to these obligations.

Pursuant
to their respective bylaws, the Company and its subsidiaries indemnify their respective directors, officers and non-officer employees for liabilities and expenses
arising from litigation in specified circumstances. In addition, they indemnify individuals serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer or in a similar capacity in another entity.
Since these indemnifications are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount due
under these indemnifications.

The
aggregate liability balance related to all guarantees was not material as of December 31, 2003.

Regulation

The Company is subject to changing social, economic and regulatory conditions. Recent state and federal regulatory initiatives and proceedings have included
efforts to influence and restrict premium rates in a manner adverse to insurers, restrict the ability of insurers to cancel policies, limit insurers' ability to impose underwriting standards, remove
barriers preventing banks from engaging in the securities and insurance businesses, change tax laws affecting the taxation of insurance companies and the tax treatment of insurance products or
competing non-insurance products that may impact the relative desirability of various personal investment products and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance products and the
insurance industry. The ultimate changes and eventual effects of these initiatives on the Company's business, if any, are uncertain.

Legal proceedings

There are two active nationwide class action lawsuits against Allstate regarding its specification of after-market (non-original equipment
manufacturer) replacement parts in the repair of insured vehicles. One of these suits alleges that the specification of such parts constitutes breach of contract and fraud, and this suit mirrors to a
large degree lawsuits filed against other carriers in the industry. The plaintiffs allege that after-market parts are not "of like kind and quality" as required by the insurance policy, and they are
seeking actual and punitive damages. In the second lawsuit, plaintiffs allege that Allstate and three co-defendants have violated federal antitrust laws by conspiring to manipulate the
price of auto physical damage coverages in such a way that not all savings realized by the use of aftermarket parts are passed on to the policyholders. The plaintiffs seek actual and treble damages.
In November 2002, a nationwide class was certified in this case. The defendants filed a petition to appeal the certification, and the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted review of the
certification. The Company has been vigorously defending both of these lawsuits, and their outcome is uncertain.

There
are a number of statewide and nationwide class action lawsuits pending against Allstate alleging that its failure to pay "inherent diminished value" to insureds under the
collision, comprehensive, uninsured motorist property damage, or auto property damage liability provisions of auto policies constitutes breach of contract and fraud. Plaintiffs define "inherent
diminished value" as the difference between the market value of the insured automobile before an accident and the market value after repair. Plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to the payment of
inherent diminished value


under
the terms of the policy. To a large degree, these lawsuits mirror similar lawsuits filed against other carriers in the industry. These lawsuits are pending in various state and federal courts,
and they are in various stages of development. A class has been certified in only one case, a multi-state class action. The Company has been vigorously defending these lawsuits and, since 1998, has
been implementing policy language in more than 40 states reaffirming that its collision and comprehensive coverages do not include diminished value claims. The outcome of these disputes is currently
uncertain.

There
are a number of state and nationwide class action lawsuits pending in various state courts challenging the legal propriety of Allstate's medical bill review processes on a number
of grounds, including, among other things, the manner in which Allstate determines reasonableness and necessity. One nationwide class action has been certified. These lawsuits, which to a large degree
mirror similar lawsuits filed against other carriers in the industry, allege these processes result in a breach of the insurance policy as well as fraud. The Company denies those allegations and has
been vigorously defending these lawsuits. The outcome of these disputes is currently uncertain.

A
number of nationwide and statewide putative class actions are pending against Allstate, which challenge Allstate's use of certain automated database vendors in valuing total loss
automobiles. To a large degree, these lawsuits mirror similar lawsuits filed against other carriers in the industry. Plaintiffs allege that flaws in these databases result in valuations to the
detriment of insureds. The plaintiffs are seeking actual and punitive damages. The lawsuits are in various stages of development and Allstate has been vigorously defending them, but the outcome of
these disputes is currently uncertain.

One
putative statewide and a number of putative nationwide class action lawsuits have been filed in various courts seeking actual and punitive damages from Allstate alleging that
Allstate violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act or state law by failing to provide appropriate notices to applicants and/or policyholders when adverse action was taken as a result of information in a
consumer report or by ordering consumer reports without a permissible purpose. These cases have been centralized in the federal court in Nashville, Tennessee. The Company is also defending a putative
nationwide class action that alleges that the Company discriminates against non-Caucasian policyholders, through underwriting and rate-making practices including the use of
credit by charging them higher premiums. The Company is also defending two putative statewide class actions challenging its use of credit under certain state insurance statutes. The Company denies
these allegations and has been vigorously defending these lawsuits. The outcome of these disputes is currently uncertain.

Allstate
is defending various lawsuits involving worker classification issues. These lawsuits include a number of putative class actions and one certified class action challenging the
overtime exemption claimed by the Company under the Fair Labor Standards Act or state wage and hour laws. These class actions mirror similar lawsuits filed recently against other carriers in the
industry and other employers. A putative nationwide class action filed by former employee agents also includes a worker classification issue; these agents are challenging certain amendments to the
Agents Pension Plan and are seeking to have exclusive agent independent contractors treated as employees for benefit purposes. Allstate has been vigorously defending these and various other worker
classification lawsuits. The outcome of these disputes is currently uncertain.

The
Company is also defending certain matters relating to the Company's agency program reorganization announced in 1999. These matters include an investigation by the U.S. Department of
Labor and a lawsuit filed in December 2001 by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") with respect to allegations of retaliation under the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A putative nationwide class action has also been filed by former employee agents alleging various violations of
ERISA, breach of contract and age discrimination. Allstate has been vigorously defending these


lawsuits
and other matters related to its agency program reorganization. In addition, Allstate is defending certain matters relating to its life agency program reorganization announced in 2000. These
matters include an investigation by the EEOC with respect to allegations of age discrimination and retaliation. Allstate is cooperating fully with the agency investigation and will continue to
vigorously defend these and other claims related to the life agency program reorganization. The outcome of these disputes is currently uncertain.

The
Company is defending various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings that allege that it engaged in business or sales practices inconsistent with state or federal law. The Company has
been vigorously defending these matters, but their outcome is currently uncertain.

Various
other legal and regulatory actions are currently pending that involve the Company and specific aspects of its conduct of business. Like other members of the insurance industry,
the Company is the target of an increasing number of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts. This litigation is
based on a variety of issues including insurance and claim settlement practices. The outcome of these disputes is currently unpredictable. However, at this time, based on their present status, it is
the opinion of management that the ultimate liability, if any, in one or more of these other actions in excess of amounts currently reserved is not expected to have a material effect on the results of
operations, liquidity or financial position of the Company.

Asbestos and environmental

Establishing net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented
by other types of claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, unresolved legal
issues regarding policy coverage, unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits, evolving and expanding theories of liability,
availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance, retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements, and estimating the extent and timing of any contractual liability,
and other uncertainties. There are complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered,
and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses
are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy
exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the
near future, and the ultimate cost may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in an increase in loss reserves.

Allstate's
reserves for asbestos claims were $1.08 billion and $635 million, net of reinsurance recoverables of $504 million and $269 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Reserves for environmental claims were $257 million and $304 million, net of reinsurance recoverables of $58 million and
$89 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Approximately 60% and 54% of the total net asbestos and environmental reserves at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, were for incurred but not reported estimated losses. The 3-year average survival ratios for net asbestos and environmental reserves excluding commutations, policy
buy-backs and settlement agreements were 16.9 and 11.3 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


Management
believes its net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and
regulations. However, due to the inconsistencies of court coverage decisions, unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage, unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and
timing of exhaustion of policy limits, evolving and plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance,
retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements, and estimating the extent and timing of any contractual liability, and other uncertainties, the ultimate cost of these claims may
vary materially from the amounts currently recorded, resulting in an increase in loss reserves. In addition, while the Company believes that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted
in its ability to estimate asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines net loss reserves, these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable
losses. Due to the
uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required.

14.   Income Taxes

A consolidated federal income tax return is filed by the Company and its eligible domestic subsidiaries. Tax liabilities and benefits realized by the consolidated
group are allocated as generated by the respective entities. Tax liabilities and benefits of ineligible domestic subsidiaries are computed separately based on taxable income of the individual
subsidiary and reported on separate federal tax returns.

The
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed its review of the Company's federal income tax returns through the 1996 tax year. Any adjustments that may result from IRS examinations
of tax returns are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the Company.

based on the assumption that certain


levels
of income will be achieved. The total amount of the valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets was $8 million and $8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Prior to January 1, 1984, ALIC and certain other life insurance subsidiaries included in the Allstate Financial segment were entitled to exclude certain
amounts from taxable income and accumulate such amounts in a "policyholder surplus" account. The balance in this account at December 31, 2003, approximately $105 million, will result in
federal income taxes payable of $37 million if distributed by these companies. No provision for taxes has been made as the Company's affected subsidiaries have no plan to distribute amounts
from this account. No further additions to the account have been permitted since 1983.

The Property-Liability statutory capital and surplus balances above exclude wholly-owned subsidiaries included in the Allstate Financial segment.

AIC
and each of its domestic property-liability and Allstate Financial subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed
or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include a variety of publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws,
regulations and general administrative rules. Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices not so prescribed.

All
states require domiciled insurance companies to prepare statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual ("Codification"),
subject to any deviations prescribed or permitted by the applicable insurance commissioner and/or director.

Dividends

The ability of the Company to pay dividends is dependent on business conditions, income, cash requirements of the Company, receipt of dividends from AIC and other
relevant factors. The payment of shareholder dividends by AIC without the prior approval of the state insurance regulator is limited to formula amounts based on net income and capital and surplus,
determined in conformity with statutory accounting practices, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. Notification and approval of inter-company lending
activities is also required by the Illinois Department of Insurance ("IL DOI") for transactions that exceed a level that is based on a formula using statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus.


In the twelve-month period beginning January 1, 2003, AIC paid dividends of $1.18 billion, which was less than the maximum amount allowed under
Illinois insurance law without the prior approval of the IL DOI based on 2002 formula amounts. Based on 2003 AIC statutory net income, the maximum amount of dividends AIC will be able to pay without
prior IL DOI approval at a given point in time during 2004 is $2.71 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time.

Risk-based capital

The NAIC has a standard for assessing the solvency of insurance companies, which is referred to as risk-based capital ("RBC"). The requirement
consists of a formula for determining each insurer's RBC and a model law specifying regulatory actions if an insurer's RBC falls below specified levels. At December 31, 2003, RBC for each of
the Company's domestic insurance subsidiaries was above levels that would require regulatory actions.

16.   Benefit Plans

Pension and other postretirement plans

Defined benefit pension plans cover most full-time employees, certain part-time employees and employee-agents. Benefits under the pension
plans are based upon the employee's length of service and eligible annual compensation. A cash balance formula was added to the Allstate Retirement Plan effective January 1, 2003. All eligible
employees hired before August 1, 2002 were provided with a one-time opportunity to choose between the cash balance formula and the final average pay formula. The cash balance
formula applies to all eligible employees hired after August 1, 2002.

The
Company also provides certain health care and life insurance subsidies for employees hired before January 1, 2003 when they retire ("Postretirement benefits"). Qualified
employees may become eligible for these benefits if they retire in accordance with the Company's established retirement policy and are continuously insured under the Company's group plans or other
approved plans in accordance with the plan's participation requirements. The Company shares the cost of the retiree medical benefits with retirees based on years of service, with the Company's share
being subject to a 5% limit on annual medical cost inflation after retirement. The Company has the right to modify or terminate these plans.

Obligations and funded status

The Company calculates benefit obligations based upon generally accepted actuarial methodologies using the projected benefit obligation ("PBO") for pension plans
and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans. The determination of pension costs and other postretirement obligations as of December 31 are determined
using an October 31 measurement date. The benefit obligations are the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed to employee service rendered. The PBO is measured using the pension
benefit formula and assumptions as to future compensation levels. A plan's funded status is calculated as the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The Company's
funding policy for the pension plans is to make annual contributions in accordance with regulations under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") and in accordance with generally accepted actuarial
principles. The Company's postretirement benefit plans are not funded.

The majority of the $2.04 billion and $1.95 billion of unrecognized net actuarial pension benefit losses in 2003 and 2002, respectively, reflect the
effect of unfavorable equity market conditions on the value of the pension plan assets and increases in the PBO resulting from decreases in the discount rate. Allstate amortizes its excess
unrecognized net actuarial losses over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits.

The
accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO") for all defined benefit pension plans was $3.62 billion and $3.04 billion at December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
The ABO is the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered. However, it differs from the PBO due to the exclusion of an assumption as
to future compensation levels. A minimum pension liability is recognized as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income when the ABO exceeds the fair value of plan assets. In 2003, the
minimum pension liability declined by $461 million and was reported as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income. In 2002, the Company recorded an increase in the minimum pension
liability of $737 million, which was reported as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income.

The
PBO, ABO, and fair value of plan assets for the Company pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan assets were $945 million, $934 million, and $692 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2003, and $3.68 billion, $3.04 billion, and $2.32 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2002.

Included
in the accrued benefit cost of the pension benefits are certain unfunded non-qualified plans and accrued benefit costs of $83 million and $77 million
for 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The weighted average health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit cost is 11.90% for 2004, gradually declining to 5.50% in
2010 and remaining at that level thereafter.

Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement health care plans. A one percentage-point increase in assumed health care
cost trend rates would increase the total of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost of other postretirement benefits and the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $5 million and $57 million, respectively. A one percentage-point decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would decrease the total of the service and interest cost
components of net periodic benefit cost of other postretirement benefits and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $8 million and $89 million, respectively.

Plan Assets

The pension plans target percentage of plan assets at 2003 and the actual percentage of plan assets, by asset category and the respective long-term
rate of return at December 31 are as follows:

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. This assumption is reviewed
annually giving consideration to appropriate financial data including, but not limited to, the plan asset allocation, the period over which benefits will be paid, historical returns on plan assets and
other relevant market data. As of the 2003 measurement date, the arithmetic average of the annual actual return on plan assets for the most recent 10 and 5 years was 9.8% and 2.0%,
respectively. This is consistent with the allocation used to determine the long-term return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2003 and 2002 of 8.5%.

Cash Flows

There was no minimum funding requirement under the IRC for the tax qualified pension plans as of December 31, 2003. The company currently plans to
contribute $161 million to its pension plans in 2004. This plan is subject to revision at the discretion of management.

The
Company contributed to the postretirement benefit plans $51 million and $45 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company estimates that it will contribute
$52 million for its postretirement benefit plans in 2004. Contributions by participants to the postretirement benefit plans were $32 million and $24 million for the years ending
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Profit sharing plans

Employees of the Company, with the exception of those employed by the Company's Canadian subsidiaries, AHL and Sterling, are eligible to become members of The
Savings and Profit Sharing Fund of Allstate Employees ("Allstate Plan"). Effective January 1, 2004, employees of AHL became eligible to become members of the Allstate Plan. The Company's
contributions are based on the Company's matching obligation and performance. The Allstate Plan includes an ESOP to pre-fund a portion of the Company's anticipated contribution. In
connection with the Allstate Plan, the Company has a note from the ESOP with a current principal balance of $94 million. The ESOP note has a fixed interest rate of 7.9% and matures in 2019.


The
Company's contribution to the Allstate Plan was $125 million, $120 million and $42 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. These amounts were reduced by
the ESOP benefit computed for the years ended December 31 as follows:

The Company contributed $34 million, $10 million and $10 million to the ESOP in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December 31,
2003, total committed to be released, allocated and unallocated ESOP shares were 3 million, 23 million, and 13 million, respectively.

Allstate
has profit sharing plans for eligible employees of its Canadian insurance subsidiaries, AHL and Sterling. Profit sharing expense for these plans is not significant.

17.   Equity Incentive Plans

The Company has three equity incentive plans which provide the Company the authority to grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options and restricted
or unrestricted shares of the Company's stock to certain employees and directors of the Company. A maximum of 78.1 million shares of common stock will be subject to awards under the plans,
subject to adjustment in accordance with the plans' terms. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, 26.9 million and 31.8 million shares, respectively, were reserved and remained available
for future issuance under these plans. To date, the Company has not issued incentive stock options. During 2003 and 2002, the Company issued 1.1 million and 0.1 million shares of
restricted stock, respectively, to employees under the plans. Generally, the restricted shares unrestrict in full on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, with awards subject to forfeiture upon
termination (other than termination due to retirement, upon which shares continue to unrestrict as provided for in the original grant).

The
Company records compensation expense for the restricted shares over the vesting period and as of December 31, 2003 the unamortized cost of the restricted shares is included in
deferred compensation expense as a component of shareholders' equity. In 2003, the Company began prospectively expensing the fair value of all stock options granted in 2003 in accordance with
SFAS 148 (see Note 2). The Company recognized $9 million, after-tax of compensation cost related to its employee plan in 2003. In prior years, the Company applied APB
Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its employee equity incentive plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized in 2002 and 2001 for its employee plan as the
exercise price of the options equaled the market price at the grant date.

Options
are granted under the plans at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Company's common stock on the applicable grant date. The options granted under the Allstate plans
generally vest ratably over a three or four-year period. The options granted may be exercised when vested and will expire ten years after the date of grant.

18.   Business Segments

Allstate management is organized around products and services, and this structure is considered in the identification of its four reportable segments. These
segments and their respective operations are as follows:

Allstate Protection

sells principally private passenger auto and homeowners insurance in the United States and Canada. Revenues generated
outside the United States were $596 million, $509 million and $518 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company evaluates the
results of this segment based upon premium growth and underwriting results.

Discontinued Lines and Coverages

consists of business no longer written by Allstate, including results from environmental, asbestos and
other discontinued lines exposures, and certain commercial and other business in run-off. This segment also includes the historical results of the commercial and reinsurance businesses
sold in 1996. The Company evaluates the results of this segment based upon underwriting results.

Allstate Financial

markets a broad line of life insurance, savings and retirement products in the United States. Life insurance products
primarily include traditional life, including term and whole life, and interest-sensitive life insurance. Savings and retirement products primarily consist of fixed annuities, market value adjusted
annuities, variable annuities, equity-indexed annuities, treasury-linked annuities and immediate annuities. Revenues generated outside the United States were immaterial with respect to Allstate
Financial total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The Company evaluates the results of this segment based upon invested asset growth, face amount of life insurance
in force and operating income.

Corporate and Other

comprises holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations.

Allstate
Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages together comprise Property-Liability. The Company does not allocate Property-Liability investment income, realized capital gains
and losses, or assets to the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments. Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability, Allstate Financial, and Corporate and Other levels
for decision-making purposes.

The
accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in Note 2. The effects of certain inter-segment transactions are excluded from segment performance
evaluation and therefore eliminated in the segment results.

Measuring segment profit or loss

The measure of segment profit or loss used by Allstate's management in evaluating performance is underwriting income for the Allstate Protection and Discontinued
Lines and Coverages segments and operating income for Property-Liability operations and Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other segments. A reconciliation of these measures to income before
dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax, is provided below.

Underwriting income (loss)

is premiums earned, less claims and claims expenses ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and
expenses, amortization of goodwill and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.


Operating income

is income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle, after-tax, excluding:

•

realized
capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which are reported
with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income,

•

amortization
of DAC, to the extent that it resulted from the recognition of realized capital gains and losses, and

•

gain
(loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax.

Interest expense is primarily incurred in the Corporate and Other segment. Capital expenditures for long-lived assets are generally made in the
Property-Liability segment. A portion of these long-lived assets are used by entities included in the Allstate Financial and Corporate and Other segments, and accordingly, are charged

Independent Auditors' Report

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

SHAREHOLDERS OF THE ALLSTATE CORPORATION

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position of The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries (collectively, "the Company") as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders' Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2003, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation, embedded derivatives in
modified coinsurance agreements, and variable interest entities. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets in 2002.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

With the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. However, the design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives and are effective at the "reasonable assurance" level.

During
the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

2.     Receivable and Payable to Subsidiaries

The majority of the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper has been loaned to subsidiaries through an intercompany loan agreement and is used for general
purposes.

In
December 2002, the Registrant issued a promissory note payable on December 1, 2007, or earlier upon demand, to its subsidiary, Allstate Insurance Company, with a
principal balance of $405 million to replace a previous note for the same amount due in April 2003. The new note has a stated annual interest rate of 4.25% until demand, at which time
the annual rate will increase to 6.25% until the note is paid in full. The Registrant has the right to prepay the note in full at any time without penalty. The Registrant recorded $17 million,
$24 million and $25 million of interest expense in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to these borrowings.

In
1996, the registrant issued 200,000 junior subordinated debentures ("debentures") with a par value of $1,000 per debenture and an interest rate of 7.83% and a contractual maturity of
December 1, 2045 to Allstate Financing II ("AF II"), a variable interest entity ("VIE"), which in prior periods met the consolidation requirements of existing accounting guidance
for reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements of The Allstate Corporation. As a result, in prior periods, the debentures were reported as a component of payable to subsidiaries on the
Statements of Financial Position of the registrant. During 2003, the Company's adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 46 resulted in the deconsolidation of AF II, resulting in the
registrant reclassifying the debentures from payable to subsidiaries to long-term debt. The debentures are presented in payable to subsidiaries for 2002. The registrant recorded
$16 million, $16 million and $57 million of interest expense in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to these debentures. The debentures are redeemable in whole, or in part,
in 2006.

3.     Supplemental Disclosures of Non-Cash Investing Activity and Cash Flow Information

The Registrant paid $299 million, $306 million and $331 million of interest on debt in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Allstate Corporation:

We
have audited the consolidated financial statements of The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003, and have issued our report thereon dated February 4, 2004 (which report expresses an unqualified opinion and includes an explanatory paragraph as to a change in
The Allstate Corporation's method of accounting for stock-based compensation, embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance agreements and variable interest entities in 2003 and a change in its method
of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002), such report is included elsewhere in the Form 10-K. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules of
The Allstate Corporation and subsidiaries, listed in the Index at Item 15 (a) 2. These financial statement schedules are the responsibility of The Allstate Corporation's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits. In our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
