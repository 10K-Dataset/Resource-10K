PART I

Item 1.     Business

General

Extra Space Storage Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004, to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop self-storage properties (“stores”). We closed our initial public offering (“IPO”) on August 17, 2004. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “EXR.”

We were formed to continue the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries, which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. These companies were reorganized after the consummation of our IPO and various formation transactions. As of

December 31, 2018

we owned and/or operated

1,647

stores in


states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately

125.7 million

square feet of net rentable space in approximately

1.2 million

units.

We operate in

two

distinct segments: (1) self-storage operations; and (2) tenant reinsurance. Our self-storage operations activities include rental operations of wholly-owned stores.  Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores.  For more information and comparative financial and other information on our reportable business segments, refer to the segment information footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Substantially all of our business is conducted through Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating Partnership”). Our primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). To the extent we continue to qualify as a REIT we will not be subject to U.S. Federal tax, with certain exceptions, on our net taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders.

We file our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You may obtain copies of these documents by visiting the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are furnished to the SEC, we make copies of these documents available to the public free of charge through our website at www.extraspace.com, or by contacting our Secretary at our principal offices, which are located at 2795 East Cottonwood Parkway, Suite 300, Salt Lake City, Utah 84121, telephone number (801) 365-4600.

Management

Members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the self-storage industry.  Our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows: Joseph D. Margolis, Chief Executive Officer, 14 years; Scott Stubbs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 18 years; Samrat Sondhi, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, 15 years; Gwyn McNeal, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, 13 years; James Overturf, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, 20 years.

Our executive management team and board of directors have an ownership position in the Company with executive officers and directors owning approximately

4,120,722

shares or

3.2%

of our outstanding common stock as of

February 19, 2019

.

Industry & Competition

Stores offer month-to-month rental of storage space for personal or business use.  Tenants typically rent fully enclosed spaces that vary in size and typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet, with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet.  Tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units.  Stores generally have on-site managers who supervise and run the day-to-day operations, providing tenants with assistance as needed.

Self-storage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes, or simply because of a need for storage space. The mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are experiencing life changes such as downsizing their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence. Items that tenants place in self-storage are typically furniture, household items


and appliances.  Commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods, records, inventory or storage for seasonal goods.

Our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business, making high-density, high-traffic population centers ideal locations for stores. A store’s price, perceived security, cleanliness, and the general professionalism of the store managers and staff are also contributing factors to a store’s ability to successfully secure rentals. Although most stores are leased to tenants on a month-to-month basis, tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time.

The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March.

Since inception in the early 1970’s, the self-storage industry has experienced significant growth. The self-storage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years. According to the Self-Storage Almanac (the “Almanac”), in 2013, the national average physical occupancy rate was

87.8%

of net rentable square feet, compared to an average physical occupancy rate of

91.7%

in 2018.

The industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership. According to the Almanac, as of the end of


, the top ten self-storage companies in the United States operated approximately

15.2%

of the total U.S. stores, and the top 50 self-storage companies operated approximately

18.4%

of the total U.S. stores. We believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future.

We believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions.  Recently we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire existing operating stores, especially for brokered portfolios. Competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities, and this will likely continue.

We are the second largest self-storage operator in the United States. We are one of five public self-storage REITs along with CubeSmart, Life Storage, National Storage Affiliates and Public Storage.

Long-Term Growth and Investment Strategies

Our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable long-term growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term stockholder value both at acceptable levels of risk. We continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities.  Our primary strategies include the following:

Maximize the performance of our stores through strategic, efficient and proactive management

We pursue revenue-generating and expense-minimizing opportunities in our operations. Our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology systems' ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management. Our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs, which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.

We continually analyze our portfolio to look for long-term value-enhancing opportunities.  We proactively redevelop properties to add units or modify existing unit mix to better meet the demand in a given market and to maximize revenue.  We also redevelop properties to reduce their effective useful age, increase visual appeal, enhance security and to improve brand consistency across the portfolio.

Acquire self-storage stores

Our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multi-store portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value. We have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. In addition, we believe our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals.  We remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value.

In addition to the pursuit of stabilized stores, we develop stores from the ground up and provide the construction capital.  We also purchase stores at the completion of construction from third party developers, who build to our specifications.  These stores purchased at completion of construction (a "Certificate of Occupancy store"), create additional long term value for our stockholders.  We are typically able to acquire these assets at a lower price than a stabilized store, and expect greater long term


returns on these stores on average. However, in the short term, these acquisitions cause dilution to our earnings during the two-to-four year period required to lease up the Certificate of Occupancy stores.  We expect that this trend will continue in 2019 as we continue to acquire Certificate of Occupancy stores.

Expand our management business

Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees as well as expand our geographic footprint, data sophistication and scale with little capital investment. We believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. We pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores.

Financing of Our Long-Term Growth Strategies

Acquisition and Development Financing

As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders.  Consequently, we require access to additional sources of capital to fund our growth. We expect to maintain a flexible approach to financing growth. We plan to finance future acquisitions through a diverse capital optimization strategy which includes but is not limited to: cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving lines of credit (the "Credit Lines"), secured and unsecured financing, equity offerings, joint ventures and the sale of stores.

Credit Lines -

We have two credit lines which we primarily use as short term bridge financing until we obtain longer-term financing through either debt or equity.  As of

December 31, 2018

, our Credit Lines had available capacity of

$790.0 million

, of which

$709.0 million

was undrawn.

Secured and Unsecured Debt -

Historically, we had primarily used traditional secured mortgage loans to finance store acquisitions and development efforts.  More recently, we obtain unsecured bank term loans and issue unsecured private placement bonds.  We will continue to utilize a combination of secured and unsecured financing for future store acquisitions and development.  As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$2.9 billion

of secured notes payable and

$1.9

billion of unsecured notes payable outstanding compared to

$2.8 billion

of secured notes payable and

$1.7

billion of unsecured notes payable outstanding as of

December 31, 2017

.

Equity -

We have an active "at the market" (ATM) program for selling stock.  We sell stock under the ATM program from time to time to raise capital when we believe conditions are advantageous.  During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, we issued

933,789

shares of common stock through our ATM program and received net proceeds of approximately

$90.5

million.  No shares were issued under the ATM program during the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

We view equity interests in our Operating Partnership as another source of capital that can provide an attractive tax planning opportunity to sellers of real estate.  We issue common and preferred Operating Partnership units to sellers in certain acquisitions.  Common Operating Partnership units receive distributions equal to the dividends on common stock, while preferred Operating Partnership units receive distributions at various negotiated rates.  We may issue additional units in the future when circumstances are favorable.

Joint Venture Financing -

As of

December 31, 2018

, we owned


of our stores through joint ventures with third parties.  Our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the acquisition of stores owned in these joint ventures.  Most joint venture agreements include buy-sell rights, as well as rights of first offer in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture.  We generally manage the day-to-day operations of the stores owned in these joint ventures and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture, but do not control the joint ventures.

Sale of Properties -

We have not historically sold a high volume of stores, as we generally believe we are able to optimize the cash flow from stores through continued operations.  However, we may sell more stores or interests in stores in the future in response to changing economic, financial or investment conditions.  For the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


, we sold one store to a third party for approximately

$40.2

million and 36 stores to a new joint venture with an existing partner for

$295.0 million

, respectively.


Regulation

Generally, stores are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Changes in any of these laws or regulations, as well as changes in laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act, which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores, or laws affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of stores or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In addition, noncompliance with any of these laws, ordinances or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could require substantial capital expenditures to ensure compliance.

Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.  Store management activities may be subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.  Changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

3,624

employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement.

Item 1A.     Risk Factors

An investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report before trading in our securities. If any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition could be harmed.

Our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments. We are a real estate company that derives our income from the operation of our stores. There are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate, including the following:

Risks Related to Our Stores and Operations

Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results.

Our revenues and net operating income can be negatively impacted by general economic factors that lead to a reduction in demand for rental space in the markets in which we operate.

If we are unable to promptly re-let our units or if the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than expected, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Virtually all of our leases are on a month-to-month basis. Any delay in re-letting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, lower than expected rental rates upon re-letting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth.

Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow.

We maintain comprehensive property and casualty insurance policies, including liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as we deem necessary or as required by our lenders), umbrella coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores. Certain types of losses, however, may be either uninsurable, not economically insurable, or coverage may be excluded on certain policies, such as losses due to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war, terrorism, or social engineering. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store. In addition, if any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.


Legal disputes, settlement and defense costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

From time to time we have to make monetary settlements or defend actions or arbitration (including class actions) to resolve tenant, employment-related or other claims and disputes. Settling any such liabilities could negatively impact our operating results and cash available for distribution to stockholders, and could also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, operate or encumber affected properties.

Our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation, which may adversely affect our results.

Our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation. The regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, to promulgate, interpret and implement regulations, and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers. As a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction, we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities, or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may adversely affect our results of operations.

Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner, developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, which could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return.

Costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses.

Under the ADA, places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores, or restrict certain further renovations of the stores, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons.  If one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ADA or other legislation, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance.

There is significant competition among self-storage operators and from other storage alternatives.

Competition in the local markets in which many of our stores are located is significant and has affected our occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses. Development of self-storage facilities has increased in recent years, which has intensified competition, and we expect it will continue to do so as newly developed facilities are opened. Development of self-storage facilities by other operators could continue to increase in the future.  Actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases in our occupancy and rental rates, while increasing our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth.

Our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. We may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price.

Our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks

•

competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital, including other publicly-traded REITs and institutional investment funds;

•

competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability;

•

the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions; and


•

we may acquire stores subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the stores and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the stores.

We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.

We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personally identifiable information, and tenant and lease data. We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. While, to date, we have not experienced a material security breach, this risk has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure

Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our Operating Partnership.

Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, and our Operating Partnership or any partner thereof. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, have fiduciary duties, as a general partner, to our Operating Partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Our duties, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, as a general partner to our Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our Company. The partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our Company or the limited partners in our Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness, and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest.

Additionally, the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we, our direct wholly-owned Massachusetts business trust subsidiary, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, nor any of our or their trustees, directors or officers, will be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we, or such trustee, director or officer, acted in good faith. In addition, our Operating Partnership is required to indemnify us, our affiliates and each of our respective trustees, officers, directors, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership, provided that our Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (1) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (2) any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful.

The provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement.


Our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we held interests in


operating stores through joint ventures. Some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers financial conditions and disputes between us and our co-venturers. We expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores. In such event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. The decision-making authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners, is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or is equally shared by us and the joint venture partners. In addition, investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers, which could harm our financial condition.

Certain provisions of Maryland law and our organizational documents, including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter, may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction.

Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common stock or 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding capital stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit. However, our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. These restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Different ownership limits apply to the family of Kenneth M. Woolley, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing; to Spencer F. Kirk, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing; and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter.

Our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders.

Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval. In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.

Maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. Our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers.


Risks Related to Our Debt Financings

Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us.

Uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects. A downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.

Required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had approximately

$4.9 billion

of outstanding indebtedness. We may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development. We may borrow under our Credit Lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores. Additionally, we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and, therefore, we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity and/or debt offerings. Further, we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a REIT or to make our expected distributions.  To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains, and we are subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year.

If we are required to utilize our Credit Lines for purposes other than acquisition activity, this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth. Therefore, our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:

•

our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;

•

we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT;

•

we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;

•

because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense;

•

we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our stores, possibly on disadvantageous terms;

•

after debt service, the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced;

•

we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns, reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;

•

we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our stores that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases and/or enforce our guarantees;

•

we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and

•

our default under any one of our mortgage loans with cross-default or cross-collateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other stores.

Increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had approximately

$4.9 billion

of debt outstanding, of which approximately

$1.3 billion

, or 25.9% was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). This variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately

3.9%

per annum. Increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions.


Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.

In certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements. Hedging involves risks, such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders.

Risks Related to Qualification and Operation as a REIT

Dividends payable by REITs may be taxed at higher rates.

Dividends payable by REITs may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of non-REIT corporations. The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for qualified dividends paid by domestic non-REIT corporations to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trust or estates is generally 20%. Dividends paid by REITs to such stockholders are generally not eligible for that rate, but under the 2017 Tax Legislation (defined below), such stockholders may deduct up to 20% of ordinary dividends (i.e., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs, such tax rate may still be higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends. This may cause investors to view REIT investments as less attractive than investments in non-REIT corporations, which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock of REITs, including our stock.  In addition, the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends, which could negatively affect the value of our stores.

Possible legislative or other actions affecting REITs could adversely affect our stockholders.

The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us in ways we cannot predict.  New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.

The federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Legislation”), has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their stockholders. Changes made by the 2017 Tax Legislation that could affect us and our stockholders include:

•

permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, which previously imposed a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a corporate tax rate of 21%;

•

permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our stockholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will allow individuals, trusts and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;

•

reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests from 35% to 21%;

•

limiting our deduction for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80% of REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction);

•

generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30% of a business’s “adjusted taxable income,” except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses (including most equity REITs) and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system with longer depreciation periods); and

•

eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.

Many of these changes that are applicable to us are effective beginning with our 2018 taxable year, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. The legislation was unclear in many respects and could still be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and IRS, any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation. In addition, it is still unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes could affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. While some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one


or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial in the future. We continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the 2017 Tax Legislation as a whole will have on us.

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.

We believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT or lose our qualification as a REIT at any time, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income;

•

we also could be subject to the U.S. Federal alternative minimum income tax for taxable years prior to 2018 and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that our U.S. individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates, and our U.S. corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject, in each case, to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code in order to maintain our REIT status, we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of $50,000 or more for each such failure. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our securities.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code is greater in the case of a REIT that, like us, holds its assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets, the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.  Our ability to satisfy the income tests depends on the sources and amounts of our gross income, which we may not be able to control.  Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income including capital gains. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. Although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS regarding our qualification as a REIT.

We will pay some taxes, reducing cash available for stockholders.

Even though we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. Extra Space Management, Inc. manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties. We, jointly with Extra Space Management, Inc., elected to treat Extra Space Management, Inc. as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) of our Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A TRS is subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its taxable income. ESM Reinsurance Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Extra Space Management, Inc., generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax, and pays certain insurance royalties to us. In addition, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants, our TRS and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties.  Also, if we sell property as a dealer (i.e., to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business), we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales. While we do not intend to sell stores as a dealer, the IRS could take a contrary position. To the extent that we are, or our TRS is, required to pay U.S. federal, state or local taxes, we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders.


Item 1B.     Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.     Properties

As of

December 31, 2018

, we owned or had ownership interests in

1,111

operating stores. Of these stores,


are wholly-owned,

four

are in consolidated joint ventures, and


are in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we managed an additional


stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own and/or manage to

1,647

. These stores are located in


states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.  The majority of our stores are clustered around large population centers.  The clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. Our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence.

As of

December 31, 2018

, approximately

910,000

tenants were leasing storage units at the operating stores that we own and/or manage, primarily on a month-to-month basis, providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually, for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends. Although leases are short-term in duration, the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time. For stores that were stabilized as of

December 31, 2018

, the average length of stay was approximately

15.1

months.

The average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores, net of discounts and bad debt, was

$16.16

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

, compared to

$15.58

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

. Average annual rent per square foot for new leases was

$17.65

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

, compared to

$16.58

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

. The average discounts, as a percentage of rental revenues, during these periods were

4.1%

and

4.0%

, respectively.

Our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations. Most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities, a mix of both drive-up buildings and multi-floor buildings. We have a number of multi-floor buildings with elevator access only, and a number of facilities featuring ground-floor access only.

The following table presents additional information regarding net rentable square feet and the number of stores by state:


Item 3.     Legal Proceedings

We are involved in various legal proceedings and are subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The estimated loss, if any, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. We could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period, notwithstanding the fact that we are currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against us.  For more information on our legal accruals, refer to the Commitments and Contingencies footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Item 5.     Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market Information

Our common stock is traded under the symbol “EXR” on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") since our IPO on August 17, 2004.  On

February 19, 2019

, the closing price of our common stock as reported by the NYSE was

$99.11

. At

February 19, 2019

, we had


holders of record of our common stock. Certain shares of the Company are held in “street” name and accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included in the foregoing number.

Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive distributions when declared by our board of directors out of any assets legally available for that purpose. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our “REIT taxable income,” which is generally equivalent to our net taxable ordinary income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid to our stockholders, annually in order to maintain our REIT qualification for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  We have historically made regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders.

Information about our equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference in Item 12 of Part III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

In November 2017, our board of directors authorized a three-year share repurchase program to allow us to acquire shares in aggregate up to $400.0 million. We expect to acquire shares through open market or privately negotiated transactions.  There have been no repurchases since the inception of this plan.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

All unregistered sales of equity securities during the year ended

Item 6.     Selected Financial Data

The following table presents selected financial data and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data).


(1)

The adoption of FASB ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2017, has resulted in a decrease in acquisition related costs as our acquisition of operating stores are considered asset acquisitions rather than business combinations.

(2)

In connection with our adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASU 2015-3,

"Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,"

in fiscal year 2016, debt issuance costs, with the exception of those related to our revolving credit facility, have been reclassified from other assets to a reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt liability. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.

(3)

In connection with our adoption of FASB ASU 2016-18, "

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,"

on January 1, 2018,

we began including amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.

Item 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Form 10-K entitled “Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information.” Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Form 10-K entitled “Risk Factors.” Dollar amounts in thousands, except share and per share data.

OVERVIEW

We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”), formed to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop self-storage properties (“stores”). We derive substantially all of our revenues from our two segments: storage operations and tenant reinsurance.  Primary sources of revenue for our storage operations segment include rents received from tenants under leases at each of our wholly-owned stores.  Our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage units, to actively manage unit rental rates, and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. Consequently, management spends a significant portion of their time maximizing


cash flows from our diverse portfolio of stores.  Revenue from our tenant reinsurance segment consists of insurance revenues from the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores.

Our stores are generally situated in highly visible locations clustered around large population centers.  These areas enjoy above average population growth and income levels. The clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale.  To maximize the performance of our stores, we employ industry-leading revenue management systems. Developed by our management team, these systems enable us to analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions. We believe our systems and processes allow us to more pro-actively manage revenues.

We operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose. Competition has impacted, and will continue to impact, our store results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity.  We believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industry-leading technology systems.  We consider a store to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80% occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1 of the current year, or has been open for three years prior to January 1 of the current year.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. A summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates:

CONSOLIDATION:

Arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”). An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

We have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created.  For each VIE created, we have performed a qualitative analysis, including considering which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each VIE and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with our financial statements.  Otherwise, our investment is generally accounted for under the equity method.  Our ability to correctly assess the influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of the investment in our consolidated financial statements.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had no consolidated VIEs. Additionally, our Operating Partnership has notes payable to one trust that is considered a VIE.  Since the Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trust, this VIE is not consolidated.

REAL ESTATE ASSETS:

We account for the acquisition of stores, including by merger and other acquisitions of real estate, in accordance with ASC 805-10, "

Business Combinations."

We use our judgment to determine if assets acquired meet the definition of a business or if the acquisition should be considered an asset acquisition subsequent to our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2017-01,

"Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business."

We must make significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred. These assumptions and estimates require judgment, and therefore others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values, which could result in differences in depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on the sale of real estate assets, and real estate and intangible asset values.

EVALUATION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT:

Long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. We review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. We focus on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. For these stores, we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will


likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. In addition, we review stores in the lease-up stage and compare actual operating results to original projections.  We may not have identified all material facts and circumstances that affect impairment of our stores. No material impairments were recorded in the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:

We hold a number of derivative instruments which we use to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, mainly related to our interest rates on variable interest debt.   We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  We assess our derivatives both at inception, and on an ongoing quarterly basis, for whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective.  The rules and interpretations relating to the accounting for derivatives are complex. Failure to apply this guidance correctly may require us to recognize all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative in earnings, which may materially impact our results.

INCOME TAXES:

We have elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, among other things, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders. We plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. For any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a REIT and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply, we would be subject to federal corporate income tax on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years.  We could also be subject to penalties and interest, and our net income may be materially different from the amounts reported in our financial statements.

We have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries, Extra Space Management, Inc., as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). In general, our TRS may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to federal corporate income tax. Interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred. If tax authorities determine that amounts paid by our TRS to us are not reasonable compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject to a penalty tax on the excess payments.

Revenues

The following table presents information on revenues earned for the years indicated:

Property Rental—

The increase in property rental revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2018

was primarily the result of an increase of

$57,827

associated with acquisitions completed in


and


.  We acquired


stores and opened three new development stores during the year ended

December 31, 2018

, and acquired


stores during the year ended December 31,


.  Property rental revenue also increased by

$36,797

during the year ended

December 31, 2018

as a result of increases in rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease of

$26,313

from the sale of 36 stores during the year ended December 31, 2017 to a new joint venture with an existing partner.  We have a 10% ownership interest in the new joint venture.  We sold one additional store during the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

Tenant Reinsurance

—The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to an increase in stores operated, as well as an increase in the average tenant insured value per policy. We operated

1,647

stores at

December 31, 2018

, compared to

1,483

stores at

December 31, 2017

.

Management Fees and Other Income

—Management fees represent the fee collected for our management of stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures.

Expenses

The following table presents information on expenses for the years indicated:

Property Operations

—The increase in property operations expense consists primarily of an increase of

$19,541

related to acquisitions completed in


and


. We acquired


stores and opened three new development stores during the year ended

December 31, 2018

and acquired


stores during the year ended

December 31, 2017

.  There was also an increase of

$7,495

related to increases in expenses at stabilized stores.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease of

$8,282

due to property sales.

Tenant Reinsurance

—Tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance.  The change was due primarily to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed and an increase in the overall average payout on claims.

General and Administrative—

General and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores, including corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. These expenses are recognized as incurred.  We did not observe any material trends in specific payroll, travel or other expenses that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores.


Depreciation and Amortization

—Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. We acquired


stores and opened three new development stores during the year ended

December 31, 2018

, and acquired


operating stores during the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

Other Income and Expenses

The following table presents information on other revenues and expenses for the years indicated:

Gain on Real Estate Transactions, Earnout on Prior Acquisitions and Impairment of Real Estate—

During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, we sold one store in California and recognized a gain of

$30,671

on this transaction.  During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we sold


stores to a new joint venture with an existing partner.  We own a 10% ownership interest in the new joint venture.  We recognized a total gain of

$118,776

related to this transaction.  During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we also recognized an impairment loss of $6,100 related to three parcels of undeveloped land where the carrying values were greater than the fair values.

Interest Expense—

The increase in interest expense during the year ended

December 31, 2018

was primarily the result of higher debt balances when compared to the prior year, as well as an increase in the average 30-day LIBOR rate.  The total face value of our debt, including our lines of credit, was

$4,854,077

at

December 31, 2018

compared to

$4,601,322

at

December 31, 2017

.  Our average interest rate for fixed and variable rate debt as of

December 31, 2018

was

3.5%

compared to

3.3%

at

December 31, 2017

.

Non-cash Interest Expense Related to Amortization of Discount on Equity Component of Exchangeable Senior Notes—

Represents the amortization of the discounts related to the equity components of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our Operating Partnership.  The decrease is related to the repayment in July 2018 of our outstanding exchangeable senior notes due 2013.

Interest Income—

Interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and interest earned on notes receivable and income earned on notes receivable from preferred and common Operating Partnership unit holders.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures—

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures.  In these joint ventures, we and our joint venture partners generally receive a preferred return on our invested capital. To the extent that cash or profits in excess of these preferred returns are generated, we receive a higher percentage of the excess cash or profits, as applicable.

Income Tax Expense—

The increase in income tax expense relates primarily to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability balance and valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the 2017 Tax Legislation.  The tax benefit recorded from this remeasurement was

$8,606

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

.   No similar remeasurement was recorded during the year ended

December 31, 2018

.  Tax expense was recognized at 21% for the year ended

December 31, 2018

as opposed to 35% in the prior year.  We also generated tax credits from our solar program in the amount of $5,629 in 2018.

Revenues

The following table presents information on revenues earned for the years indicated:

Property Rental—

The increase in property rental revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2017

was primarily the result of an increase of

$59,694

associated with acquisitions completed in


and


.  We acquired


stores during the year ended

December 31, 2017

and


stores during the year ended December 31,


.  Property rental revenue also increased by

$40,439

during the year ended

December 31, 2017

as a result of increases in rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores.

Tenant Reinsurance

—The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to the increase in stores operated. We operated

1,483

stores at

December 31, 2017

, compared to

1,427

stores at

December 31, 2016

.

Management Fees and Other Income

—Management fees represent the fee collected for our management of stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures.


Expenses

The following table presents information on expenses for the years indicated:

Property Operations

—The increase in property operations expense consists primarily of an increase of

$19,607

related to acquisitions completed in


and


. We acquired


operating stores during the year ended

December 31, 2017

and


stores during the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

Tenant Reinsurance

—Tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance.  The change is due primarily to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed.

Acquisition Related Costs and Other—

For the year ended December 31, 2016, acquisition related costs represented closing and other transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of operating stores, which were accounted for as business combinations.  On January 1, 2017, we adopted the guidance in ASU 2017-01,

"Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business,"

which resulted in our acquisition of operating stores being accounted for as asset acquisitions rather than business combinations.  Accordingly, closing and other transaction costs have been capitalized in 2017 as part of the acquisition price for asset acquisitions, rather than being expensed as incurred.

General and Administrative—

General and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores, including corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. These expenses are recognized as incurred. General and administrative expenses for the year ended

December 31, 2017

decreased when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of an expense of $4,000 that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 as the result of a legal settlement.  There were no such expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017.  We did not observe any material trends in specific payroll, travel or other expenses that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores.

Depreciation and Amortization

—Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. We acquired


operating stores during the year ended

December 31, 2017

, and


operating stores during the year ended

December 31, 2016

.


Other Income and Expenses

The following table presents information on other revenues and expenses for the years indicated:

Gain on Real Estate Transactions, Earnout on Prior Acquisitions, and Impairment of Real Estate—

During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we sold


stores to a new joint venture with an existing partner.  We have a 10% ownership interest in the new joint venture.  We recognized a total gain of

$118,776

related to this transaction.  During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we also recognized an impairment loss of $6,100 related to three parcels of undeveloped land.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, through various transactions, we sold a total of

nine

stores located in Indiana, Ohio and Texas.  We recognized a total gain of

$11,358

related to these dispositions.

During 2014, we acquired five stores where we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net operating income for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2016.  As the operating income of these stores during the earnout period was higher than originally estimated, an additional payment was due to the sellers of $4,284, which was recorded as a loss during 2016.

Interest Expense—

The increase in interest expense during the year ended

December 31, 2017

was primarily the result of higher debt balances when compared to the prior year as well as an increase in our average interest rate.  The total face value of our debt, including our lines of credit, was

$4,601,322

at

December 31, 2017

compared to

$4,363,697

at

December 31, 2016

.  Our average interest rate as of

December 31, 2017

was

3.3%

compared to

3.0%

at

December 31, 2016

.

Non-cash Interest Expense Related to Amortization of Discount on Equity Component of Exchangeable Senior Notes—

Represents the amortization of the discounts related to the equity components of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our Operating Partnership.

Interest Income—

Interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and interest earned on notes receivable and income earned on notes receivable from preferred and common Operating Partnership unit holders.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures—

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures—Gain on Sale of Real Estate Assets and Purchase of Joint Venture Partners’ Interests—

Beginning January 1, 2017, the acquisition of our joint venture partners' interests in stores are no longer considered business combinations achieved in stages (step acquisitions) due to the adoption of ASU 2017-01,

"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business."

Instead, these transactions are considered asset acquisitions; therefore we had no gain or loss to record related to these transactions during the year ended December 31, 2017.  In 2016 we had several large transactions with our joint venture partners that did result in gains.  We acquired 11 stores from


the ESS WCOT LLC joint venture ("WCOT") in a step acquisition.  We recorded a gain of

$4,651

as a result of the transaction.  Similarly, we acquired


stores from our PRISA II joint venture ("PRISA II") in a separate step acquisition and recorded a gain of

$6,778

on the transaction.  Immediately after the step acquisition, we sold our interest in the PRISA II joint venture, which still owned


properties, to our joint venture partners, and recognized a gain of $30,846.  Lastly, we acquired six stores from our VRS Self Storage LLC joint venture (“VRS”) in a step acquisition, where we again recorded a gain of

$26,923

.

Income Tax Expense—

The decrease in income tax expense relates primarily to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability balance and valuation allowance as a result of the 2017 Tax Legislation.  The tax benefit recorded from this remeasurement was

$8,606

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

.  We also generated tax credits from our solar program in the amount of $5,308.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

Funds from operations ("FFO") provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. We believe FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings. Net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe FFO more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (“NAREIT”) as net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the consolidated financial statements.  FFO should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with GAAP.

The computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions.

The following table presents the calculation of FFO for the periods indicated:

Beginning January 1, 2017, the disposition of properties is not considered the disposal of a business due to the adoption of ASU 2017-01 "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business."


SAME-STORE RESULTS

Comparison of the Year Ended

December 31, 2018

to the Year Ended

December 31, 2017

Our same-store pool for the periods presented consists of


stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80% or more for one calendar year.  We believe that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to: occupancy, rental revenue growth, operating expense growth, net operating income growth, etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments.  Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole.  The following table presents operating data for our same-store portfolio:

Same-store revenues for the

year ended ended December 31, 2018

increased due to gains in occupancy and higher rental rates for both new and existing customers. Expenses were higher for the year ended

December 31, 2018

, primarily due to increases in property taxes, payroll and benefits and marketing.

The following table presents a reconciliation of same-store net operating income to net income as presented on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:

were moderately higher primarily due to increases in property taxes and marketing expense offset by decreases in repairs and maintenance and insurance.

The following table presents a reconciliation of same-store net operating income to net income as presented on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:

(1)

Beginning January 1, 2017, the disposition of properties is not considered the disposal of a business due to the adoption of ASU 2017-01 "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business."


(2)

Beginning January 1, 2017, acquisition related costs have been capitalized due to the adoption of ASU 2017-01 "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business."

CASH FLOWS

Cash flows from operating activities increased as expected from our continued growth in revenues through rates along with the increase in the number of properties we own and operate.  Cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to our acquisition, development, and sales of stores and investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures, and fluctuate depending on our actions in those areas.  Cash flows from financing activities depend primarily on our debt and equity financing activities. A summary of cash flows along with significant components are as follows:

We believe that cash flows generated by operations, along with our existing cash and cash equivalents, the availability of funds under our existing lines of credit, and our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the next twelve months.  These cash needs include operating expenses, monthly debt service payments, recurring capital expenditures, acquisitions, building redevelopments and expansions, distributions to unit holders and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our REIT qualification.

We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2019, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds under our existing lines of credit, curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Financing Strategy

We will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors. Although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate. In making financing decisions, we will consider factors including but not limited to:

•

the interest rate of the proposed financing;

•

the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our stores;

•

prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing;


•

the purchase price of stores acquired with debt financing;

•

long-term objectives with respect to the financing;

•

target investment returns;

•

the ability of particular stores, and our Company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments;

•

overall level of consolidated indebtedness;

•

timing of debt maturities;

•

provisions that require recourse and cross-collateralization; and

•

corporate credit ratios including fixed charge coverage ratio and max secured/unsecured indebtedness.

Our indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse, cross-collateralized, cross-defaulted, secured or unsecured. In addition, we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens, or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis. We may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing stores, for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$57,496

available in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. During


and


, we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents; however, there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had

$4,854,077

face value of debt, resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of

28.4%

.  As of

December 31, 2017

, we had $4,601,322 face value of debt, resulting in a debt total enterprise value ratio of 28.1%.  As of

December 31, 2018

, the ratio of total fixed-rate debt and other instruments to total debt was

74.1%

(including

$2,192,550

on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixed-rate debt). As of

December 31, 2017

, the ratio of total fixed-rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 74.7% (including $2,283,049 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixed-rate debt).  The weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed- and variable-rate debt at

December 31, 2018

and


was

3.5%

and 3.3%, respectively.  Certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt. We are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt. We were in compliance with all financial covenants at

December 31, 2018

.

We expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of Operating Partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit.  In addition, we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs.

Our liquidity needs consist primarily of operating expenses, monthly debt service payments, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders and distributions to unit holders necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. We may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt, shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In addition, we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships, which may require us to raise additional funds. We may also use Operating Partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from self-storage owners who desire tax-deferral in their exiting transactions.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.


CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table presents information on future payments due by period as of

December 31, 2018

:

The operating leases above include minimum future lease payments on leases for


of our operating stores as well as leases of our corporate offices.

Three

ground leases include additional contingent rental payments based on the level of revenue achieved at the store.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was

3.4%

, and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was

3.9%

.

For more information on our contractual obligations related to real estate acquisitions, refer to our commitments and contingencies footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

SEASONALITY

The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

Item 7a.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future income, cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control.

As of

December 31, 2018

, we had approximately

$4.9

billion in total face value debt, of which approximately

$1.3

billion was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately

$12.6

million annually.

Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.


Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments to help manage interest rate risk using designated hedge relationships. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate interest payments between two parties based on a contractual underlying notional amount, but do not involve the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. See our Derivatives footnote in our Notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our use of derivative contracts.

1.     DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Extra Space Storage Inc. (the “Company”) is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”), formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004, to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties located throughout the United States. The Company was formed to continue the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries, which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. The Company’s interest in its stores is held through its operating partnership, Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating Partnership”), which was formed on May 5, 2004. The Company’s primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT.

The Company invests in stores by acquiring wholly-owned stores or by acquiring an equity interest in real estate entities. At

December 31, 2018

, the Company had direct and indirect equity interests in

1,111

storage facilities. In addition, the Company managed


stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which it owns and/or manages to

1,647

. These stores are located in


states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.  The Company also offers tenant reinsurance at its owned and managed stores that insures the value of goods in the storage units.

2.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly- or majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Certain amounts previously reported in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period’s presentation, primarily to change the presentation of Gain on real estate transactions, earnout from prior acquisitions, and impairment of real estate on the consolidated statement of operations.  The Company has included Gain on real estate transactions, earnout from prior acquisitions, and impairment of real estate as a component of Income from operations to present gain and losses on sales of properties in accordance with ASC 360-10-45-5. The change was made for the prior periods as the Securities and Exchange Commission has eliminated Rule 3-15(a) of Regulation S-X as part of Release No. 33-10532; 34-83875; IC-33203, which had required REITs to present gain and losses on sale of properties outside of continuing operations in the statement of operations.

Immaterial Correction to Consolidated Balance Sheets

In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company determined that the negative balances in the "Investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures" line should be presented separately as liabilities. As a result,

$5,816

should have been reported as "Cash distributions in unconsolidated real estate ventures" as of December 31, 2017. The Company concluded that the amount was not material to the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 but has elected to present these amounts as liabilities in the accompanying financial statements for consistent presentation. The classification error had no effect on the previously reported consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Variable Interest Entities

The Company accounts for arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights as variable interest entities (“VIEs”). An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity’s equity holders as a group either: (a) lack the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an entity is deemed to be a VIE, the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest, or combination of variable interests, that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the VIE, is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.

The Company has concluded that under certain circumstances when the Company enters into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (i), (ii) (b) or (c) of the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, the Company has performed a qualitative analysis, including considering which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each VIE and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with the Company’s financial statements. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has notes payable to

one

trust that is a VIE under condition (ii)(a) above. Since the Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trust, this VIE is not consolidated.

The Company’s investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control, and joint ventures which are VIEs in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value Disclosures

Derivative financial instruments

Currently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate forward curves.

The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. In conjunction with the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s fair value measurement guidance, the Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of

December 31, 2018

, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The table below presents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2018

, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Long-lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. The Company reviews each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. The Company focuses on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. For these stores, the Company determines whether the decrease is temporary or permanent, and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. In addition, the Company reviews stores in the lease-up stage and compares actual operating results to original projections.

When the Company determines that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred, the Company compares the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets.

When real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value of the assets, net of selling costs.  The Company compares the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy).  If the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, the Company would recognize a loss on the assets held for sale. The operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented.

The Company assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. An investment is impaired if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred, and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment.

As of

December 31, 2018

and


, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, other financial instruments included in other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, variable-rate notes payable, revolving lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at

, approximate fair value.

The fair values of the Company’s notes receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership unit holders and other fixed rate notes receivable were based on the discounted estimated future cash flow of the notes (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the discount rate used approximated the current market rate for loans with similar maturities and credit quality. The fair values of the Company’s fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts were estimated using the discounted estimated future cash payments to be made on such debt (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the discount rates used approximated current market rates for loans, or groups of loans, with similar maturities and credit quality. The fair value of the Company’s exchangeable senior notes was estimated using an average market price for similar securities obtained from a third party.


EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(continued)

Amounts in thousands, except store and share data, unless otherwise stated

The fair values of the Company’s fixed-rate assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated:

Real Estate Assets

Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized. The construction period begins when expenditures for the real estate assets have been made and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use are in progress. The construction period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are generally between

five

and


years.

Stores purchased at the time of certificate of occupancy issuance and stores purchased subsequent to the Company's adoption of ASU 2017-01 on January 1, 2017 are considered asset acquisitions.  As such, the purchase price is allocated to the real estate assets acquired based on their relative fair values, which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, is determined as if vacant. Intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their relative fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases. The Company measures the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers, which is based on the Company’s historical experience with turnover in its stores. Any debt assumed as part of the acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates.  Acquisition-related transactions costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price.

Intangible lease rights represent: (1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on

three

stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are amortized to expense over the life of the leases and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on

eight

stores where the leases were assumed by the Company at rates that were lower than the current market rates for similar leases. The values associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the lease terms.

Real Estate Sales

In general, sales of real estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition; other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition.

Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures

The Company’s investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control and joint ventures which are VIEs in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Under the equity method, the Company’s investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for the Company’s share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on the Company’s ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For

the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows, the Company follows the “look through” approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture’s sale of assets), in which case it is reported as an investing activity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States and at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of

three

months or less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash is comprised of letters of credit and escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States relating to earnest money deposits on potential acquisitions, real estate taxes, insurance and capital expenditures.

Other Assets

Other assets consist of equipment and fixtures, rents receivable from our tenants, investments in trusts, notes and other receivables, other intangible assets, deferred tax assets, prepaid expenses and the fair value of interest rate swaps. Depreciation of equipment and fixtures is computed on a straight-line basis over

three

to

five

years.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. The Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Risk Management and Use of Financial Instruments

In the normal course of its ongoing business operations, the Company encounters economic risk. There are

three

main components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its interest-bearing liabilities. Credit risk is the risk of inability or unwillingness of tenants to make contractually required payments. Market risk is the risk of declines in the value of stores due to changes in rental rates, interest rates or other market factors affecting the value of stores held by the Company. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its interest rate risk.

Exchange of Common Operating Partnership Units

Redemption of common Operating Partnership units for shares of common stock, when redeemed under the original provisions of the Operating Partnership agreement, are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to the Company’s equity.

Revenue and Expense Recognition

Rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally on month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period. Late charges, administrative fees and merchandise sales are recognized as income when earned. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities is recognized based on the Company's ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. Interest income is recognized as earned.

The Company's management fees are earned subject to the terms of the related management services agreements ("MSAs").  These MSAs provide that the Company will perform management services, which include leasing and operating the property and providing accounting, marketing, banking, maintenance and other services.  These services are provided in exchange for monthly management fees, which are based on a percentage of revenues collected from stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures.  MSAs generally have original terms from

three

to

five

years, after which management services are provided on a month-to-month basis unless terminated.  Management fees are due on the last day of each calendar month that management services are provided.

The Company accounts for the management services provided to a customer as a single performance obligation which are rendered over time each month.  The total amount of consideration from the contract is variable as it is based on monthly revenues, which are influenced by multiple factors, some of which are outside the Company's control.  Therefore, the Company recognizes the revenue at the end of each month once the uncertainty is resolved.  Due to the standardized terms of the MSAs, the Company accounts for all MSAs in a similar, consistent manner.  Therefore, no disaggregated information relating to MSAs is presented.

Property expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. The Company accrues for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts and estimates.  If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected.

Tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage. The Company records an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history. The unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end, including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported. The Company uses a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received. The administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported. Annually, a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid claims liability. Prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known. The impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations. The unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value. Each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program. Tenants can purchase policies in amounts of

2,000

dollars to

10,000

dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee. As of

December 31, 2018

, the average insurance coverage for tenants was approximately

2,900

dollars. The Company’s exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant. The Company purchases reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount for any one event.  The Company does not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, among other things, the Company is required to distribute at least

90%

of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its income and assets. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to stockholders. The Company plans to continue to operate so that it meets the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. For any taxable year that the Company fails to qualify as a REIT and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply, we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years.  The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended

December 31, 2018

,

0%

(unaudited) of all distributions to stockholders qualified as a return of capital.

The Company has elected to treat its corporate subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc. (“ESMI”), as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). In general, the Company’s TRS may perform additional services for tenants and may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to federal corporate income tax. ESM Reinsurance Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ESMI, generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal corporate income tax and state insurance premiums tax.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. At

Stock-Based Compensation

The measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors are based on estimated fair values. Awards granted are valued at fair value and any compensation expense is recognized over the service periods of each award.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed using the two-class method by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. All outstanding unvested restricted stock awards contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends and participate in undistributed earnings with common stockholders; accordingly, they are considered participating securities that are included in the two-class method. Diluted earnings per common share measures the performance of the Company over the reporting period while giving effect to all potential common shares that were dilutive and outstanding during the period. The denominator includes the weighted average number of basic shares and the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares that were dilutive had been issued, and is calculated using either the two-class, treasury stock or as if-converted method, whichever is most dilutive. Potential common shares are securities (such as options, convertible debt, Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series A Units”), Series B Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series B Units”), Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series C Units”), Series D Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series D Units” and together with the Series A Units, Series B Units and Series C Units, the “Preferred OP Units") and common Operating Partnership units (“OP Units”)) that do not have a current right to participate in earnings of the Company but could do so in the future by virtue of their option, redemption or conversion right.

In computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, net income is adjusted to add back any changes in earnings in the period associated with the convertible security. The numerator also is adjusted for the effects of any other non-discretionary changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares. In computing diluted earnings per common share, only potential common shares that are dilutive (those that reduce earnings per common share) are included. For the years ended

For the purposes of computing the diluted impact of the potential exchange of the Preferred OP Units for common shares upon redemption, where the Company has the option to redeem in cash or shares and where the Company has stated the intent and ability to settle the redemption in shares, The Company divided the total value of the Preferred OP Units by the average share price of

$90.30

for the year ended

The following table presents the number of weighted OP Units and Preferred OP Units, and the potential common shares, that were excluded from the computation of earnings per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive:

The Operating Partnership had

$575,000

of its

3.125%

Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2035 (the “2015 Notes”) issued and outstanding as of

December 31, 2018

. The 2015 Notes could potentially have a dilutive impact on the Company’s earnings per share calculations. The 2015 Notes are exchangeable by holders into shares of the Company’s common stock under certain circumstances per the terms of the indenture governing the 2015 Notes. The exchange price of the 2015 Notes was

$92.80

per share as of

December 31, 2018

, and could change over time as described in the indenture. The Company has irrevocably agreed to pay only cash for the accreted principal amount of the 2015 Notes relative to its exchange obligations, but retained the right to satisfy the exchange obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount in cash and/or common stock.

Though the Company has retained that right, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 260,

“Earnings per Share,”

requires an assumption that shares would be used to pay the exchange obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount, and requires that those shares be included in the Company’s calculation of weighted average common shares outstanding for the

no

shares related to the 2015 Notes were included in the computation for diluted earnings per share as the exchange price exceeded the per share price of the Company’s common stock during this period.

For the purposes of computing the diluted impact on earnings per share of the potential exchange of Series A Units for common shares upon redemption, where the Company has the option to redeem in cash or shares and where the Company has stated the positive intent and ability to settle at least

$101,700

of the instrument in cash (or net settle a portion of the Series A Units against the related outstanding note receivable), only the amount of the instrument in excess of

$101,700

is considered in the calculation of shares contingently issuable for the purposes of computing diluted earnings per share as allowed by ASC 260-10-45-46.

The computation of earnings per share is as follows for the periods presented:

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-9, “

Revenue from Contracts with Customers,

” ("Topic 606") which amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. Topic 606 outlines a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers.  Topic 606 became effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company determined that its property rental revenue and tenant reinsurance revenue are not subject to the guidance in Topic 606, as they qualify as lease contract and insurance contracts, which are excluded from its scope.  The Company's management fee revenue is included in the scope of Topic 606, and revenue recognized under the standard does not differ materially from revenue recognized under previous guidance.  The Company adopted the standard

using the modified retrospective transition method as of January 1, 2018.  The Company's adoption of Topic 606 did not result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment or any significant changes to financial statement line items.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

"Leases (Topic 842),"

which modifies the accounting for leases, intending to increase transparency and comparability of organizations by requiring balance sheet presentation of leased assets and increased financial statement disclosure of leasing arrangements.  ASU 2016-02 will require entities to recognize a liability for their lease obligations and a corresponding asset representing the right to use the underlying asset over the lease term.  Lease obligations are to be measured at the present value and accounted for using the effective interest method.  The accounting for the leased asset will differ slightly depending on whether the agreement is deemed to be a financing or operating lease. For finance leases, the leased asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis and recorded separately from the interest expense in the statements of operations, resulting in higher expense in the earlier part of the lease term. For operating leases, the depreciation and interest expense components are combined, recognized evenly over the term of the lease, and presented as a reduction to operating income. ASU 2016-02 requires that assets and liabilities be presented or disclosed separately, and requires additional disclosure of certain qualitative and quantitative information related to these lease agreements.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company plans to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach as of January 1, 2019.  The Company expects to elect the package of practical expedients upon adoption, which allows for the application of the standard solely to the transition period in 2019 but does not require application to prior fiscal comparative periods presented.  The Company estimates that the cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded upon adoption will not have a significant impact on retained earnings.  The primary impact is expected to be related to the Company's


operating ground leases and

two

corporate facility leases under which it serves as lessee.  The Company estimates the lease assets and lease liabilities to be between

$90,000

and $

110,000

related to its operating leases upon the adoption of Topic 842.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, "

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,"

which requires that a statement of cash flows explains the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2018, and now presents restricted cash along with cash and cash equivalents in its consolidated statements of cash flows.  Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,

"Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business,"

which provides guidance on whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.  Specifically, when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business.  Additionally, ASU 2017-01 also provides other guidance providing a more robust framework to use in determining whether a set of assets and activities is a business.  This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early application of ASU 2017-01 is permitted for transactions for which the acquisition or disposition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued.   The Company adopted the guidance in ASU 2017-01 prospectively to new acquisitions beginning on January 1, 2017.  The adoption of this guidance resulted in a decrease in acquisition related costs, as the Company's acquisition of operating stores are considered asset acquisitions rather than business combinations under ASU 2017-01, and such costs are capitalized under the new guidance.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12,

"Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements for Accounting for Hedging Activities,"

which amends and simplifies existing guidance for the financial reporting of hedging relationships to allow companies to better portray the economic effects of risk management activities in their financial statements. ASU 2017-12 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, "

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40

):

Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract."

ASU 2018-15 amends the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract, and aligns them with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.  ASU 2018-15 also requires that entities amortize the capitalized implementation costs over the term of the hosting arrangement. ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted,

REAL ESTATE ASSETS

The components of real estate assets are summarized as follows:

As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had

one

operating store and

one

parcel of land classified as held for sale. The estimated fair value less selling costs of these assets are greater than the carrying value of the assets, and therefore

no

loss has been recorded related to these assets. These assets held for sale are included in the self-storage operations segment of the Company’s segment information.

The Company amortizes to expense intangible assets—tenant relationships on a straight-line basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility (currently estimated at

18 months

). The Company amortizes to expense the intangible lease rights over the terms of the related leases. Amortization related to the tenant relationships and lease rights was

$9,050

,

$14,349

, and

$21,133

for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, respectively. The remaining balance of the unamortized lease rights will be amortized over the next

one year

to

43 years

.  Accumulated amortization related to intangibles was

$121,238

and

$112,347

as of

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively.

4.     PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

The following table shows the Company’s acquisitions of stores for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and


.  The table excludes purchases of raw land or improvements made to existing assets.

(1)

Store acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2018 include the acquisition of


stores previously held in joint ventures where the Company held a noncontrolling interest.  The Company purchased its partners' remaining equity interests in the joint ventures, and the properties owned by the joint ventures became wholly owned by the Company.

(2)

Store acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017 include the acquisition of

seven

stores that had been owned by joint ventures in which the Company held an equity interest.

Store Disposals

On August 16, 2018, the Company sold a store located in California that had been classified as held for sale for

$40,235

in cash. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of

$30,671

.

On November 30, 2017, the Company sold


stores located in various states that had been classified as held for sale for an aggregate sales price of

$295,000

.  The buyer of these properties was Storage Portfolio II JV, LLC ("SP II"), a newly formed joint venture in which the Company has a

10.0%

equity interest.  The Company recognized a gain of

$118,776

related to this disposition, which represented

90.0%

of the total gain.  This amount is included in

Gain on real estate transactions, earnout on prior acquisitions and impairment of real estate

on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.  The Company deferred

10.0%

of the gain due to the fact that it held an equity interest in the buyer, which resulted in a reduction in the carrying value of the Company's investment in SP II.

On September 13, 2017, the Company closed on the sale of a parcel of land located in New York that had been classified as held for sale for $

19,000

in cash.  This parcel of land had been written down to its fair value less selling costs during the six months ended June 30, 2017, and a loss of

$3,500

was recorded.  Therefore, no additional gain or loss was recorded related to this sale at the time of closing.

On July 26, 2016, the Company completed the sale of an operating store located in Indiana that had been classified as held for sale for

$4,447

in cash. The Company recognized

no

gain or loss related to this disposition.

On April 20, 2016, the Company completed the sale of

seven

operating stores located in Ohio and Indiana that had been classified as held for sale for

$17,555

in cash. The Company recognized a gain of

On April 1, 2016, the Company disposed of a single store in Texas in exchange for

85,452

of the Company's OP Units valued at

$7,689

. The Operating Partnership canceled the OP Units received in this disposition. The Company recognized a gain of

$93

related to this disposition, which is included in

Gain on real estate transactions, earnout on prior acquisitions and impairment of real estate

on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

Loss on Earnouts from Prior Acquisitions

On December 2014, the Company acquired a portfolio of

five

stores located in New Jersey and Virginia.  As part of this acquisition, the Company agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net operating income for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2016.  At the acquisition date, the Company recorded an estimated liability related to this earnout provision.  The operating income of these stores during the earnout period was higher than expected, resulting in an increase in the estimate of the amount due to the sellers of

$4,284

, which was recorded as a loss and included in

Gain on real estate transactions, earnout on prior acquisitions and impairment of real estate

on the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.

5.     INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED REAL ESTATE VENTURES

Investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures and cash distributions in unconsolidated real estate ventures consist of the following:

(1)

Subsequent to year end, the Company acquired its joint venture partner's interests in Extra Space West One LLC and Extra Space West Two LLC joint ventures.  The


stores owned by these joint ventures became wholly-owned by the Company subsequent to this acquisition. The Company paid cash of

$172,515

and assumed an existing loan of

$17,157

.

In these joint ventures, the Company and the joint venture partner generally receive a preferred return on their invested capital. To the extent that cash or profits in excess of these preferred returns are generated through operations or capital transactions, the Company would receive a higher percentage of the excess cash or profits, as applicable, than its equity interest.

In accordance with ASC 810, the Company reviews all of its joint venture relationships annually to ensure that there are no entities that require consolidation. As of

December 31, 2018

, there were no previously unconsolidated entities that were required to be consolidated as a result of this review.

two

new joint ventures (WICNN JV LLC and GFV JV, LLC), in which the Company has

$22,734

and

$8,720

of preferred equity, respectively.  The Company earns an

8.0%

return on its preferred equity in these joint ventures, which has priority over other distributions.

stores from its ESS WCOT LLC joint venture ("WCOT") in a step acquisition.  The Company owned

5.0%

of WCOT, with the other

95.0%

owned by affiliates of Prudential Global Investment Management ("Prudential").  WCOT created a new subsidiary, Extra Space Properties 132 LLC ("ESP 132") and transferred


stores into ESP 132.  WCOT then distributed ESP 132 to the Company and Prudential on a pro rata basis.  This distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of

$68,814

.  Immediately after the distribution, the Company acquired Prudential's

95.0%

interest in ESP 132 for

$153,304

, resulting in

100%

ownership of ESP 132 and the related


stores.  Based on the purchase price of Prudential's share of ESP 132, the Company determined that the fair value of its investment in ESP 132 immediately prior to the acquisition of Prudential's share was

$8,119

, and the Company recorded a gain of

$4,651

as a result of remeasuring to fair value its existing equity interest in ESP 132.  This gain is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.  The fair value of the stores purchased was recorded at

$161,072

stores into ESP 131.  PRISA II then distributed ESP 131 to the Company and Prudential on a pro rata basis.  This distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of

$4,326

.  Immediately after the distribution, the Company acquired Prudential's

95.6%

interest in ESP 131 for

$238,679

, resulting in

100%

This gain is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.  The fair value of the stores purchased was recorded at

$248,530

.  Subsequent to these transactions, PRISA II owned


stores.

properties as outlined above, the Company sold its

4.42%

interest in PRISA II to Prudential for

$34,758

in cash.  The carrying value of the Company's investment prior to the acquisition was

$3,912

2.0%

to

4.4%

.  The Company continues to account for its investment in PRISA under the equity method of accounting.  The Company subsequently sold its interest in PRISA II as noted above.

On February 2, 2016, the Company acquired

six

stores from its VRS Self Storage LLC joint venture (“VRS”) in a step acquisition. The Company owns

45.0%

of VRS, with the other

55.0%

six

stores into ESP 122. VRS then distributed ESP 122 to the Company and Prudential on a pro rata basis. This distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of

$17,261

. Immediately after the distribution, the Company acquired Prudential’s

55.0%

interest in ESP 122 for

$53,940

, resulting in

100%

ownership of ESP 122 and the related

six

stores. Based on the purchase price of Prudential’s share of ESP 122, the Company determined that the fair value of its investment in ESP 122 immediately prior to the acquisition of Prudential’s share was

$44,184

, and the Company recorded a gain of

$26,923

as a result of re-measuring to fair value its existing equity interest in ESP 122. This gain is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners’ interests on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.  The fair value of the stores purchased was recorded at

$98,082

.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures consists of the following:

$27,867

of these equity investments over its original basis. The excess basis is amortized over


years.

6.     NOTES PAYABLE AND REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT

The components of notes payable are summarized as follows:

On December 7, 2018, the Company amended the credit agreement originally entered into on October 14, 2016 (the "Credit Agreement").  The amended Credit Agreement provides for aggregate borrowings of up to

$1.35 billion

consisting of a senior unsecured

four

-year revolving credit facility of

$650 million

maturing January 2023 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), a senior unsecured loan of

$480 million

maturing January 2024 (the Tranche 1 Term Loan Facility”) and a senior unsecured loan of

$220 million

maturing October 2023 (the “Tranche 2 Term Loan Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Tranche 1 Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facility”). The Company may request an increase in the amount of the commitments under the Credit Facility up to an aggregate of

$2.0 billion

, and extend the term of the Revolving Credit Facility for up to

two

additional periods of

six months

each, after satisfying certain conditions.

Amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates, at the Company’s option, equal to either (i) LIBOR plus the applicable Eurodollar rate margin or (ii) the applicable base rate which is the applicable margin plus the highest of (a)

0.0%

, (b) the federal funds rate plus

0.50%

, (c) U.S. Bank’s prime rate or (d) the Eurodollar rate plus

1.00%

. The applicable Eurodollar rate margin will range from

1.05%

to

1.7%

per annum and the applicable base rate margin will range from

0.05%

to

0.7%

per annum, in each case depending on the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and the type of loan. If the Operating Partnership obtains a specified investment grade rating from two or more specified credit rating agencies, and elects to use the alternative rates based on the Company’s debt rating, the applicable Eurodollar rate margin will range from

0.75%

to

1.65%

per annum and the applicable base rate margin will range from

0.0%

to

0.7%

per annum, in each case depending on the rating achieved and the type of loan.

The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and is not secured by any assets of the Company.  We are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants.

The following table summarizes the scheduled maturities of notes payable, excluding available extensions, at

All of the Company’s lines of credit are guaranteed by the Company. The following table presents information on the Company’s lines of credit, the proceeds of which are used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes, for the periods indicated:

7.     DERIVATIVES

The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s investments and borrowings.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. A portion of these changes is excluded from accumulated other comprehensive income as it is allocated to noncontrolling interests. During the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. During


, the Company estimates that

$17,439

will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense.

The following table summarizes the terms of the Company’s


derivative financial instruments, which have a total combined notional amount of

$2,231,162

as of

December 31, 2018

:

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

The table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets:

Effect of Derivative Instruments

The tables below present the effect of the Company’s derivative financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented. No tax effect has been presented as the derivative instruments are held by the Company:

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

The Company has agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain provisions pursuant to which, the Company could be declared in default of its derivative obligations if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender.

The Company also has an agreement with some of its derivative counterparties that incorporates the loan covenant provisions of the Company’s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with the loan covenant provisions would result in the Company being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was

$1,785

. As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions as of

December 31, 2018

, it could have been required to cash settle its obligations under these agreements at their termination value of

$2,422

.

8.     NOTES PAYABLE TO TRUSTS

During July 2005, ESS Statutory Trust III (the “Trust III”), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, issued an aggregate of

$40,000

of preferred securities which mature on

July 31, 2035

. In addition, Trust III issued

1,238

of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price of

$1,238

. On July 27, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities of

$41,238

were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership (“Note 3”). Note 3 had a fixed rate of

6.91%

through July 31, 2010, and then was payable at a variable rate equal to the

three month LIBOR

plus

2.4%

per annum. Effective July 11, 2011, Trust III entered into an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate to be paid at

5.0%

per annum and matured

July 11, 2018

. The interest on Note 3, payable quarterly, was be used by Trust III to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities became redeemable by Trust III with

no

prepayment premium on

July 27, 2010

.

During May 2005, ESS Statutory Trust II (the “Trust II”), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership of the Company, issued an aggregate of

$41,000

of preferred securities which mature on

June 30, 2035

. In addition, Trust II issued

1,269

of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price of

$1,269

. On May 24, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities of

$42,269

were

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership (“Note 2”). Note 2 had a fixed rate of

6.7%

through

June 30, 2010

, and then was payable at a variable rate equal to the

three month LIBOR

plus

2.4%

per annum. Effective July 11, 2011, Trust II entered into an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate to be paid at

5.0%

per annum and matured

July 11, 2018

. The interest on Note 2, payable quarterly, was be used by Trust II to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities became redeemable by Trust II with

no

prepayment premium on June 30, 2010.

During April 2005, ESS Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership of the Company issued an aggregate of

$35,000

of trust preferred securities which mature on

June 30, 2035

. In addition, Trust issued

1,083

of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price of

$1,083

. On April 8, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred and common securities of

$36,083

were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership (the “Note”). The Note has a variable rate equal to the

three month LIBOR

plus

2.3%

per annum. Effective June 30, 2010, Trust entered into an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate to be paid at

5.1%

per annum and matured on

June 30, 2018

. The interest on the Note, payable quarterly, will be used by Trust to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities are redeemable by Trust with

no

prepayment premium.

Trust, Trust II and Trust III (together, the “Trusts”) are VIEs because the holders of the equity investment at risk (the trust preferred securities) do not have the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly affect the entities’ economic performance because of their lack of voting or similar rights. Because the Operating Partnership’s investment in the Trusts’ common securities was financed directly by the Trusts as a result of its loan of the proceeds to the Operating Partnership, that investment is not considered to be an equity investment at risk. The Operating Partnership’s investment in the Trusts is not a variable interest because equity interests are variable interests only to the extent that the investment is considered to be at risk, and therefore the Operating Partnership cannot be the primary beneficiary of the Trusts. Since the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Trusts, they have not been consolidated. A debt obligation has been recorded in the form of notes as discussed above for the proceeds, which are owed to the Trusts by the Company. The Company has also recorded its investment in the Trusts’ common securities as other assets.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repaid a total principal amount of

9.     EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR NOTES

In September 2015, the Operating Partnership issued

$575,000

of its

3.125%

Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2035. Costs incurred to issue the 2015 Notes were approximately

$11,992

, consisting primarily of a

2.0%

underwriting fee. These costs are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over

five years

, which represents the estimated term based on the first available redemption date, and are included in exchangeable senior notes, net, in the consolidated balance sheets. The 2015 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are fully guaranteed by the Company. Interest is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning April 1, 2016, until the maturity date of October 1, 2035. The Notes bear interest at

3.125%

per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the 2015 Notes may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash (for the principal amount of the 2015 Notes) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, for cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s option. The exchange rate of the 2015 Notes as of

December 31, 2018

was approximately

10.78

shares of the Company’s common stock per

$1,000

principal amount of the 2015 Notes.

The Operating Partnership may redeem the 2015 Notes at any time to preserve the Company’s status as a REIT. In addition, on or after October 5, 2020, the Operating Partnership may redeem the 2015 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at

100%

of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon at least


days but not more than


days prior written notice to the holders of the 2015 Notes. The holders of the 2015 Notes have the right to require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the 2015 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, on October 1 of the years 2020, 2025 and 2030, (unless the Operating Partnership has called the 2015 Notes for redemption), and upon the occurrence of certain designated events, in each case for a repurchase price equal to

100%

of the principal amount of the 2015 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Certain events are considered “Events of Default,” as defined in the indenture governing the 2015 Notes, which may result in the accelerated maturity of the 2015 Notes.

Additionally, the 2015 Notes can be exchanged during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock of the Company is greater than or equal to

130%

of the exchange price for at least


trading days during a period of


consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The price of the Company’s common stock did not exceed

130%

of the exchange price for the required time period for the 2015 Notes during the quarter ended December 31,  2018.

On June 21, 2013, the Operating Partnership issued

$250,000

of its 2013 Notes at a

1.5%

discount, or

$3,750

. Costs incurred to issue the 2013 Notes were approximately

$1,672

. These costs were amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over

five years

, which represented the estimated term based on the first available redemption date.  The 2013 Notes bore interest at

2.375%

per annum and contained an exchange settlement feature.  The Operating Partnership redeemed all remaining outstanding 2013 Notes on July 5, 2018.

GAAP requires entities with convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. The Company therefore accounts for the liability and equity component of the 2015 Notes separately. The equity components are included in paid-in capital in stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets, and the value of the equity components are treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt components. The discount is being amortized as interest expense over the remaining period of the debt through its first redemption date, October 1, 2020 for the 2015 Notes. The effective interest rate on the liability components of the 2015 Notes is

4.0%

, which approximates the market rate of interest of similar debt without exchange features (i.e. nonconvertible debt) at the time of issuance.

Information about the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes (collectively, the "Notes"), including the total carrying amounts of the equity components, the principal amounts of the liability components, their unamortized discounts and net carrying amount were as follows for the periods indicated:

Repurchase of 2013 Notes

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased a total principal amount of

$49,259

of the 2013

Notes, which represented all of the remaining principal amount outstanding. The Company paid cash of

$80,270

for the total of

the principal amount and the exchange value in excess of the principal amount.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased a total principal amount of

$13,911

of the 2013 Notes. The Company paid cash of

$20,042

for the total of the principal amount and the exchange value in excess of the principal amount.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased a total principal amount of

$22,194

of the 2013 Notes. The Company paid cash for the principal amount, and issued a total of

148,940

shares of common stock valued at

$13,066

for the exchange value in excess of the principal amount.

The Company allocated the value of the consideration paid to repurchase the 2013 Notes (1) to the extinguishment of the liability component and (2) to the reacquisition of the equity component. The amount allocated to the extinguishment of the liability component is equal to the fair value of that component immediately prior to extinguishment. The difference between the consideration attributed to the extinguishment of the liability component and the sum of (a) the net carrying amount of the repurchased liability component, and (b) the related unamortized debt issuance costs, is recognized as a gain on debt extinguishment. The remaining settlement consideration is allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component of the repurchased 2013 Notes and recognized as a reduction of stockholders’ equity.

12.     NONCONTROLLING INTEREST REPRESENTED BY PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS

Classification of Noncontrolling Interests

GAAP requires a company to present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section, but separate from the company’s equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as equity transactions. If noncontrolling interests are determined to be redeemable, they are to be carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity.

The Company has evaluated the terms of the Operating Partnership’s preferred units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by such preferred units as stockholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling amount as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying amount, or (2) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made.

At

December 31, 2018

and


, the noncontrolling interests represented by the Preferred OP Units qualified for classification as permanent equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  The partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership (as amended, the "Partnership Agreement")  provides for the designation and issuance of the OP Units.  Noncontrolling interests in Preferred OP Units were presented net of notes receivable from preferred Operating Partnership unit holders of

$108,644

and

$120,230

as of

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively, as more fully described below.

Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Units

The Series A Units were issued in June 2007.  Series A Units in the amount of

$101,700

bear a fixed priority return of

2.3%

, and originally had a fixed liquidation value of

$115,000

. The remaining balance participates in distributions with, and has a liquidation value equal to, that of the common OP Units. The Series A Units became redeemable at the option of the holder on September 1, 2008, which redemption obligation may be satisfied, at the Company’s option, in cash or shares of its common stock.  As a result of the redemption of

114,500

Series A Units in October 2014, the remaining fixed liquidation value was reduced to

$101,700

which represents

875,480

Series A Units.  On April 18, 2017, the holder of the Series A Units and the Operating Partnership agreed to reduce the fixed priority return on the Series A Units from

5.0%

to

2.3%

in exchange for a reduction in the interest rate of the related loan, as more fully described below.

The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series A Units. The Series A Units have priority over all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

On June 25, 2007, the Operating Partnership loaned the holders of the Series A Units

$100,000

. The note receivable bears interest at

2.1%

.  On April 18, 2017, a loan amendment was signed modifying the maturity date of the loan to the later of the death of the Series A Unit holder or his spouse and also lowering the interest rate of the loan from

4.9%

to

2.1%

.  The loan amendment was determined to be a loan modification under GAAP, and therefore no change in value was recognized.  The loan is secured by the borrower’s Series A Units.

No

future redemption of Series A Units can be made unless the loan secured by the Series A Units is also repaid. The Series A Units are shown on the balance sheet net of the

$100,000

loan because the borrower under the loan is also the holder of the Series A Units.

Series B Redeemable Preferred Units

The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series B Units. The Series B Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series C Units and Series D Units, and senior to all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

The Series B Units were issued in 2013 and 2014 and have a liquidation value of

$25.00

per unit for a current fixed liquidation value of

$41,902

which represents

1,676,087

Series B Units. Holders of the Series B Units receive distributions at an annual rate of

6.0%

. These distributions are cumulative. The Series B Units are redeemable at the option of the holder on the first anniversary of the date of issuance, which redemption obligations may be satisfied at the Company’s option in cash or

shares of its common stock.  The Series B Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series C Units and Series D Units, and senior to all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units

The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series C Units. The Series C Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series B Units and Series D Units, and senior to all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

The Series C Units were issued in 2013 and 2014 and have a liquidation value of

$42.10

per unit for a current fixed liquidation value of

$12,462

which represents

296,020

Series C Units. From issuance to the fifth anniversary of issuance, each Series C Unit holder will receive quarterly distributions equal to the quarterly distribution for common OP Unit plus

$0.18

. Beginning on the fifth anniversary of issuance, each Series C Unit holder will receive a fixed quarterly distribution equal to the aggregate quarterly distribution payable in respect of such Series C Unit during the four quarters immediately preceding the fifth anniversary of issuance divided by four. These distributions are cumulative. The Series C Units became redeemable at the option of the holder

one year

from the date of issuance, which redemption obligation may be satisfied at the Company’s option in cash or shares of its common stock. The Series C Units also became convertible into common OP Units at the option of the holder

one year

from the date of issuance, at a rate of

0.9145

common OP Units per Series C Unit converted. This conversion option expires upon the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance.

In December 2014, the Operating Partnership loaned holders of the Series C Units

$20,230

. The notes receivable, which are collateralized by the Series C Units, bear interest at

5.0%

and mature on December 15, 2024. The Series C Units are shown on the balance sheet net of the loan because the borrower under the loan receivable is also the holder of the Series C Units.

On December 1, 2018, certain holders of the Series C Units converted their Series C Units into common OP Units, with a total of

407,996

Series C Units being converted into a total of

373,113

common OP Units.  As part of this conversion, the holders of the Series C Units agreed to pledge the common OP Units received in the conversion as collateral on the loan receivable to replace the Series C Units that were converted.  As of

December 31, 2018

, the total outstanding balance of the loan receivable was

$19,735

, of which

$8,644

is shown as a reduction of the noncontrolling interests related to the Series C Units and

$11,091

is shown as a reduction of the noncontrolling interests related to the common OP Units on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Series D Redeemable Preferred Units

The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series D Units. The Series D Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series B Units and Series C Units, and senior to all other partnership interest of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

The Series D Units have been issued at various times from 2014 to 2017.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Operating Partnership issued

446,420

Series D Units valued at

$11,161

in conjunction with wholly-owned and joint venture acquisitions.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Operating Partnership issued a total of

2,687,711

Series D Units valued at

$67,193

in conjunction with the acquisition of real estate assets.

The Series D Units have a liquidation value of

$25.00

per unit, for a current fixed liquidation value of

$92,064

which represents

3,682,521

Series D Units. Holders of the Series D Units receive distributions at an annual rate between

3.0%

and

5.0%

. These distributions are cumulative. The Series D Units will become redeemable at the option of the holder on the first anniversary of the date of issuance, which redemption obligation may be satisfied at the Company’s option in cash or shares of its common stock.  In addition, certain of the Series D Units are exchangeable for common OP Units until the tenth anniversary of the date of issuance, with the number of common OP Units to be issued equal to

$25.00

per Series D Unit, divided by the value of a share of common stock as of the exchange date.

Amounts in thousands, except store and share data, unless otherwise stated

The Company’s interest in its stores is held through the Operating Partnership. Between its general partner and limited partner interests, the Company held a

91.0%

majority ownership interest therein as of

December 31, 2018

. The remaining ownership interests in the Operating Partnership (including Preferred OP Units) of

9.0%

are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating Partnership.

The noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership represents OP Units that are not owned by the Company.  OP Units are redeemable at the option of the holder, which redemption may be satisfied at the Company's option in cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s common stock (based on the

ten

-day average trading price) at the time of the redemption. Alternatively, the Company may, at its sole discretion, elect to acquire those OP Units in exchange for shares of its common stock on a

one-for-one basis

, subject to anti-dilution adjustments provided in the Operating Partnership agreement. The

ten

-day average closing stock price at

December 31, 2018

, was

$91.64

and there were

5,994,251

OP Units outstanding.

Assuming that all of the OP Unit holders exercised their right to redeem all of their OP Units on

December 31, 2018

and the Company elected to pay the OP Unit holders cash, the Company would have paid

$549,313

in cash consideration to redeem the units.

OP Unit activity is summarized as follows for the periods presented:

Additionally,

373,113

common OP Units were issued in the conversion of

407,996

Series C Units on December 1, 2018.  These newly issued OP Units are pledged as collateral on the existing loan receivable to the Series C Unit holders.  As a result, noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership is reported net of

$11,091

of the loan receivable, which represents the portion of the note receivable that is collateralized by the OP Units.

GAAP requires a company to present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company’s equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as equity transactions. If noncontrolling interests are determined to be redeemable, they are to be carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity.

The Company has evaluated the terms of the common OP Units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by the common OP Units as stockholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling amount as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying amount, or (2) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made.

Other Noncontrolling Interests

Other noncontrolling interests represent the ownership interest of third parties in

two

consolidated joint ventures as of

December 31, 2018

. One joint venture owns

two

operating stores in Texas and an operating store and a development store in Colorado, and the other owns an operating store in Pennsylvania and a development store in New Jersey. The voting interests of the third-party owners are between

As of

December 31, 2018

,

1,587,625

shares

were available for issuance under the Company’s 2015 Incentive Award Plan (the “Plan”).

Option grants are issued with an exercise price equal to the closing price of stock on the date of grant. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee (“CNG Committee”) at the time of grant, options shall vest ratably over a

four

-year period beginning on the date of grant. Each option wi

ll be exercisable once it has vested. Options are exercisable at such times and subject to such terms as deter

mined by the CNG Committee, but under no circumstances may be exercised if such exercise would cause a violation of the ownership limit in the Company’s charter. Options expire


years from the date of grant.  Beginning in 2017, the CNG Committee decided to the replace stock options granted to executives with performance based stock units for executive compensation.  See the "Performance-Based Stock Units" section below.

Also as defined under the terms of the Plan, restricted stock grants may be awarded. The stock grants are subject to a vesting period over which the restrictions are released and the stock certificates are given to the grantee. During the performance or vesting period, the grantee is not permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or assign shares of restricted stock granted under the Plan; however, the grantee has the ability to vote the shares and receive nonforfeitable dividends paid on shares. Unless otherwise determined by the CNG Committee at the time of grant, the forfeiture and transfer restrictions on the shares lapse over a

four

-year period beginning on the date of grant.

Option Grants

A summary of stock option activity is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of


and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on

December 31, 2018

. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock.

The weighted average fair value of stock options granted in


, was

$20.30

.  There were

no

options granted in


or 2017.  The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:


EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC.

(continued)

Amounts in thousands, except store and share data, unless otherwise stated

The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for the estimated life of the option. The Company uses actual historical data to calculate the expected price volatility, dividend yield and average expected term. The forfeiture rate, which is estimated at a weighted-average of

7.4%

of unvested options outstanding as of

December 31, 2018

, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimates.

A summary of stock options outstanding and exercisable as of

December 31, 2018

, is as follows:

The Company recorded compensation expense relating to outstanding options of

$570

,

$649

and

$729

in general and administrative expense for the years ended

December 31, 2018

$1,266

and

$1,444

, respectively. At

December 31, 2018

, there was

$344

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

0.72

years. The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time, including the expected forfeiture rate. Therefore, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense at

December 31, 2018

noted above does not necessarily represent the expense that will ultimately be realized by the Company in the statement of operations.

Common Stock Granted to Employees and Directors

The Company recorded

$10,606

, respectively. The forfeiture rate, which is estimated at a weighted-average of

10.2%

of unvested awards outstanding as of

December 31, 2018

, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimates. At

December 31, 2018

there was

$10,870

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

A summary of the Company’s employee and director share grant activity is as follows:

Performance-based Stock Units

In 2017, the CNG Committee changed its compensation for executives to issue performance-based stock units (the "PSUs") as a replacement for stock option awards.  The PSUs granted to executives represent the right to earn shares of the Company's common stock.  These awards have two financial performance components: (1) the Company's core FFO performance ("FFO Target"), and (2) the Company's total stockholder return relative to the performance of a defined group of peers ("TSR Target").  Each of these performance components are weighted

50%

and are measured over the performance period, which is defined as the

three

-year period ending December 31 from the year of grant.  At the end of the performance period, the financial performance components are reviewed to determine the number of shares actually granted to executives, which can be as low as

zero

shares and up to a maximum of

two

shares issued for each PSU.  A summary of the PSU activity is as follows:

The Company estimated the fair value of the PSUs as of the grant date, using the closing trading price of the Company's common stock on the grant date to value the FFO Target portion.  A Monte Carlo simulation model was used to calculate the fair value of the TSR Target portion of the PSUs, using the following assumptions:

Under the terms of the PSUs, dividends for the entire measurement period are paid in cash when the shares are issued, so a dividend yield of

zero

was used.  The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time, including the probabilities associated with achieving the FFO Targets (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy).  Therefore, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense at

December 31, 2018

noted above does not necessarily represent the expense that will ultimately be realized by the Company in the statement of operations.

15.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

The Company has a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code under which eligible employees can contribute up to

60%

of their annual salary, subject to a statutory prescribed annual limit. For the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, the Company made matching contributions to the plan of

$2,833

,

$2,212

and

$1,944

, respectively, based on

100%

of the first

3%

and up to

50%

of the next

2%

of an employee’s compensation.

16.     INCOME TAXES

As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which is distributed annually to its stockholders. However, the Company has elected to treat

one

of its corporate subsidiaries, Extra Space Management, Inc., as a TRS. In general, the Company’s TRS may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to federal corporate income tax. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740,

“Income Taxes.”

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company has elected to use the Tax-Law-Ordering approach to determine when excess tax benefits will be realized.

The income tax provision for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, is comprised of the following components:

The major sources of temporary differences stated at their deferred tax effects are as follows:

The state income tax net operating losses expire between 2019 and 2036. The valuation allowance is associated with the state income tax net operating losses. The tax years 2014 through 2017 remain open related to the state returns, and 2015 through 2017 for the federal returns.

Federal tax reform legislation that was enacted on December 22, 2017 (commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) (the “2017 Tax Legislation”) made substantial changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Among those changes were a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from the previous rate of 35% to 21%, the elimination or modification of various allowed deductions, and a deduction for REIT stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates of up to 20% of ordinary REIT dividends. Many of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Legislation required guidance through the issuance of Treasury regulations in order to assess their effect. It is possible that there will be technical corrections legislation proposed with respect to the 2017 Tax Legislation, the effect of which cannot be predicted and may be adverse to the Company or its stockholders.

The SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Legislation. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the 2017 Tax Legislation enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the 2017 Tax Legislation for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Legislation is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the 2017 Tax Legislation. The Company recorded a provisional estimate of the impact of the 2017 Tax Legislation for the year ended

December 31, 2017

. The SAB 118 measurement period closed on December 22, 2018. The Company's accounting for the 2017 Tax Legislation under SAB 118 has been finalized with no additional adjustments.

For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The tax benefit recorded related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance and valuation allowance was

$8,606

, which is included as a component of income

17.     SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company’s segment disclosures present the measure used by the chief operating decision makers ("CODMs") for purposes of assessing each segment’s performance. The Company’s CODMs are comprised of several members of its executive management team who use net operating income ("NOI") to assess the performance of the business for the Company’s reportable operating segments. NOI for our self-storage operations represents total property revenue less direct property operating expenses.  NOI for our tenant reinsurance segment represents tenant reinsurance revenues less tenant reinsurance expense.

The Company’s segments, prior to 2017, were comprised of

three

reportable segments: (1) rental operations; (2) tenant reinsurance; and (3) property management, acquisition and development. Based on how the CODMs reviews performance and makes decisions, the Company realigned its segments into

two

reportable segments: (1) self-storage operations and (2) tenant reinsurance. The self-storage operations activities include rental operations of wholly-owned stores.  The Company's consolidated revenues equal total segment revenues plus property management fees and other income. Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in the stores operated by the Company.  Excluded from segment revenues and net operating income is property management fees and other income.

For all periods presented, substantially all of our real estate assets, intangible assets, other assets, and accrued and other liabilities are associated with the self-storage operations segment. The prior periods have been restated to conform to the current presentation. Financial information for the Company’s business segments is set forth below:

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings and is subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The estimated loss, if any, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in any particular period, notwithstanding the fact that the Company is currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against it.  As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company was involved in various legal proceedings and was subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, such litigation, claims and complaints are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company was under agreement to acquire


stores at a total purchase price of

$271,526

. Of these stores,


are scheduled to close in 2019 at a purchase price of

$247,498

, and

two

are scheduled to close in 2020 at a purchase price of

$24,028

. Additionally, the Company is under agreement to acquire


stores with joint venture partners, for a total investment of

$73,860

.

Eleven

of these stores are scheduled to close in 2019, while the remaining

two

are scheduled to close in 2020.

Although there can be no assurance, the Company is not aware of any material environmental liability, for which it believes it will be ultimately responsible, that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, the uses and conditions of properties in the vicinity of the Company’s properties, the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the Company is unaware with respect to its properties could result in future material environmental liabilities.

Item 9A.     Controls and Procedures

(i)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

We have a disclosure committee that is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure obligations of the Company on a timely basis. The disclosure committee meets quarterly and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

(a)

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2018

. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued the following attestation report over our internal control over financial reporting.

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Extra Space Storage Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Extra Space Storage Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Extra Space Storage Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.


We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8 and our report dated February 26, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
