PART I

Item 1. Business

General

Extra Space Storage Inc. (the “Company”) is a self-administered
and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004 to own, operate, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage facilitates. On August 17, 2004, the Company
commenced operations effective with the completion of its initial public offering of 20,200,000 shares of common stock. The Company received proceeds from the offering of $234.8 million, net of issuance costs of $17.7 million. As part of the
offering, the Company granted the underwriters the right to purchase up to 3,030,000 additional shares within thirty days after the offering to cover any overallotments. On September 1, 2004, the underwriters exercised their right and purchased an
additional 3,030,000 shares of common stock with proceeds to the Company of $35.2 million, net of issuance costs of $2.6 million. The Company also paid additional issuance costs of $5.6 million. The Company’s common stock is traded on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol “EXR”.

The
Company was formed to continue the business of its of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries (the “Predecessor”), which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. These companies were reorganized after the consummation of
the offering and various formation transactions. As of December 31, 2004, the Company held ownership interests in 140 properties located in 20 states with an aggregate of 9.2 million square feet of net rentable space and greater than 70,000
customers. Of these 140 properties, 122 are wholly owned, and 18 are owned in joint-venture partnerships. An additional 20 properties are owned by third parties and operated by the Company in exchange for a management fee.

Substantially all of the Company’s business is conducted through Extra
Space Storage LP, (the “Operating Partnership”), and its primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. The
Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be subject to tax, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is
distributed to its shareholders.

The Company files its annual
report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You may obtain copies of these documents by visiting the
SEC’s Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 or by accessing the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. The Company’s website is

Management

Members of the Company’s senior management team have significant
experience in all aspects of the self-storage industry, with an average of more than ten years of industry experience. The senior management team has collectively acquired and/or developed more than 200 properties during the past 25 years for the
Predecessor and other entities. Kenneth M. Woolley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard S. Tanner, Senior Vice President Development, have worked in the self-storage industry since 1977 and led two of the earliest self-storage facility
development projects in the United States.

The remainder of
our executive management team and their years of experience with the Company and Predecessors are as follows: Kent Christensen, Chief Financial Officer, 7 years; Charles Allen, Chief Legal



Officer, 7 years; Timothy Arthurs, Senior Vice President Operations, 5 years; Scott Stubbs, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, 5 years;
Kenneth T. Woolley; Senior Vice President Acquisitions, 6 years.

The executive management team has guided the Predecessor through substantial growth, developing and acquiring over $750 million in assets since 1996. This growth was previously funded with internal funds and more than $245 million was
raised in private equity capital since 1998, largely from sophisticated, high net-worth individuals and institutional investors such as affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. and Fidelity Investments.

The Company’s senior management and board of directors have a
significant ownership position in the Company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 5.6 million shares or 17.8% of the common stock as of February 28, 2005

.

Industry & Competition

Self-storage properties refer to properties that offer do-it-yourself, month-to-month storage space rental for personal or business use. Self-storage
offers a cost-effective and flexible storage alternative. Tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited, exclusive access. Tenants have responsibility for moving their
items into and out of their units. Self-storage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet, with an interior height of eight to 12 feet.

Self-storage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions, whether due to a
life-change, or simply because of a need for extra storage space. The mix of residential tenants using a self-storage property is determined by a property’s local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living
space or others who are not yet settled in large homes.

The
range of items residential tenants place in self-storage properties range from cars, boats and recreational vehicles, to furniture, household items and appliances. Commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and
frequent access to their goods, records or extra inventory or storage for seasonal goods.

Self-storage properties provide an accessible storage alternative at a relatively low cost. Tenants typically rent an enclosed space to which they have unlimited, exclusive access. Properties generally have on-site
managers who supervise and run the day-to-day operations, providing tenants with assistance as needed.

The Company’s research has shown that tenants choose a self-storage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or
business, making high-density, high-traffic population centers ideal locations for locating a self-storage property. A property’s perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staffs are also contributing factors
to a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals. Although most self-storage properties are leased to tenants on a month-to-month basis, tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time.

Self-storage does have seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for
self-storage properties. Based on the Company’s experience, generally, there is increased leasing activity at self-storage properties during the summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period. The highest level
of occupancy is achieved in July and August, while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in February and March.

Since it’s inception in the early 1970’s the self-storage industry has seen significant growth. In the past ten years, there has been even
greater growth. According to the 2005 Self-Storage Almanac (the “Almanac”), in 1994 there were approximately 19,500 self-storage properties in the United States, with an average occupancy rate of 84.8% of net rentable square feet compared
to approximately 38,800 self-storage properties in 2004 with an average occupancy rate of 84.2% of net rentable square feet. As population densities have increased in the United States, there has been an increase in self-storage awareness and
development, which the Company expects will continue in the future.



The Company has found that the factors most important to tenants when choosing a self-storage site are a
convenient location, a clean environment, friendly service and a professional helpful staff. Its experience also indicates that successfully competing in the self-storage industry requires an experienced and dedicated management team that is
supported by an efficient and flexible operating platform that is responsive to tenants’ needs and expectations.

Increased competition has affected the Company’s business and has led to both pricing and discounts pressure. This has limited the Company’s
ability to increase revenues in many markets in which it operates. Many markets have been able to absorb the increase in self-storage development due to superior demographics and density. However, select markets have not been able to absorb the new
facilities and have not performed as well as others.

Competition can also be seen on the acquisitions front, especially with brokered portfolios. Bidding wars have been commonplace between both public and private entities, and this competition has hindered the Company’s ability to grow
at a more consistent pace.

The growth within the industry has
also led to an increased emphasis on site location, property design, innovation and functionality, especially for new sites slated for high-density population centers, to accommodate the requirements and tastes of local planning and zoning boards,
and to distinguish a facility from other offerings in the market.

The Company strives to have a creative and flexible approach to its development projects and it is open to a broad array of opportunities because of this flexibility. Due to the attractive architecture of many of the Company’s
properties, the Company has been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most self-storage developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial users.

The industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership. According to the
Almanac, the top five self-storage companies in the United States owned approximately 9.9% of total U.S. self-storage properties, and the top 50 self-storage companies owned approximately 15.6% of the total U.S. properties. The Company believes this
fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level into the future. The Company also believes it is well positioned to be able to compete for acquisitions given its enhanced ability to access capital as a public company and its
historical reputation for closing deals.

According to the
Almanac, the Company is the seventh largest self-storage owner and operator in the United States as of December 31, 2004. The Company is now one of five self-storage REITS along with Public Storage Inc. (PSA), Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc. (SHU);
Sovran Self-Storage, Inc. (SSS), and U-Store-It Inc. (YSI).

Growth and
Investment Strategies

The Company’s primary business
objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to its shareholders and to achieve sustainable long-term growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term shareholder value. The Company’s business strategy to achieve
these objectives consists of the following elements:

•

Maximize Cash Flow at the Company’s Properties.

The Company seeks to maximize revenue-generating opportunities by responding to changing local market conditions through interactive yield
management of the rental rates at its properties. Supported by STORE (the Company’s licensed property management software), the Company will seek to respond to changing market conditions and to maximize revenue-generating opportunities through
interactive rental rate management.

•

Pursue Opportunities to Acquire Self-Storage Portfolios.

The Company intends to continue to selectively acquire, for cash or by utilizing units in its operating partnership as acquisition
currency, privately-held self-storage portfolios and single self-storage assets in



high population density areas with an undersupply or equilibrium of self-storage demand, re-flag them under the Extra Space Storage brand name, and implement
its comprehensive property and operating systems so as to maximize operating performance over time.

•

Strategically Select and Develop Sites.

The Company plans to continue to expand by selecting and developing new self-storage properties, through joint ventures, with
cost-effective, appealing construction in desirable areas based on specific data, including: visibility and convenience of location, market occupancy and rental rates, market saturation, traffic count, household density, median household income,
barriers to entry and future demographic and migration trends. Because of the attractive architecture of many of the Company’s properties, it has been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most self-storage developers in areas
usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial properties.

•

Continue Joint Venture Strategy to Pursue Development Opportunities and Enhance Returns.

The Company plans to grow by continuing its development
activities in conjunction with its joint venture partners while mitigating the risks normally associated with early-stage development and lease-up activities. Where appropriate, the Company plans to also seek to acquire properties in a
capital-efficient manner in conjunction with its joint venture partners. Typically in these deals, the Company seeks to have a small capital interest, and once its joint venture partner receives a predetermined return on its investment, the
remaining profits will be distributed to the joint venture partners.

Financing of the Company’s Growth Strategies

•

Acquisition Financing

On September 9, 2004, the Company, as guarantor, and its Operating Partnership entered into a $100 million revolving line of credit, which
includes a $10 million swingline subfacility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is collateralized by self-storage properties. Since the Company’s initial public offering, the Company has funded substantially all of its
acquisitions through the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2004, the Credit Facility had approximately $63.5 million of available borrowings based on the assets collateralizing the Credit Facility. The Company expects to maintain a flexible
approach in financing new property acquisitions. The Company plans to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under the Credit Facility, traditional secured mortgage financing and additional equity offerings.

•

Development Joint Venture Financing

The Company owns 13 of its stabilized properties and five of its lease-up properties through joint venture with third parties, including
affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. In each joint venture, the Company manages the day-to-day operations of the underlying properties and has the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties or financings by the
applicable joint venture. The Company’s joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business. Under the operating agreements for the joint ventures, the Company typically
maintains the right to receive between 35% and 50% of the available cash flow from operations after the joint venture partner has received a predetermined return, and between 35% and 50% of the available cash flow from capital transactions after the
joint venture partner has received a return of its capital plus such predetermined return. Some joint venture agreements include certain buy-sell rights, as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint
venture.

•

Disposition of Properties

The Company will continue to review its portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine
the potential disposition of these properties to fund other growth.

Regulation

Generally, self-storage properties
are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures. Changes in any of these laws or regulations, as well as



changes in laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act, or CERCLA, which increase the potential liability for
environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties, or laws affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures,
loss of self-storage sites or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Under the American Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain
federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the properties, or restrict
certain further renovations thereof, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any
non-complying feature, and in substantial capital expenditures. To the extent the Company’s properties are not in compliance, the Company is likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ADA.

Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as
determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, as well as are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant
thereto.

Property management activities are often subject to
state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.

Changes in any of the laws governing the Company’s conduct could have an adverse impact on the ability to conduct its business or could materially
affect its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of February 28, 2005, the
Company had 469 employees and believes its relationships with its employees to be good. The Company’s employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement.

Item 2. Properties

As of
December 31, 2004, the Company owned and operated 140 self-storage properties located in 20 states, 122 of which are wholly owned and 18 of which are held in joint ventures with third parties. The Company also manages an additional 20 properties for
third parties. The Company’s properties are generally situated in convenient, highly visible locations regionally clustered around high-density, high-income population centers, such as Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/Northern New
Jersey and San Francisco. Its properties contain an aggregate of approximately 9.2 million net rentable square feet of space configured in approximately 87,500 separate storage units. As of December 31, 2004, its stabilized portfolio (which consists
of 111 properties) was on average 85.4% occupied, while its lease-up portfolio (which consists of 29 properties) was on average 69.7% occupied. The Company considers a property to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of
occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. The Company considers a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 85% occupancy rate, or has been open for four years. Over the next 24 months, the Company expects its lease-up
properties to achieve 85% occupancy, which it believes is in line with lease-up periods typical in the self-storage industry.

As of December 31, 2004, greater than 70,000 tenants were leasing storage units at the Company’s 140 properties, primarily on a month-to-month basis,
providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Although leases are short-term in duration, the typical tenant tends to remain at the Company’s properties for an extended period of time. For properties
that were stabilized as of December 31, 2004, the average length of stay was approximately 16 months.



The following table sets forth additional information regarding the occupancy of the stabilized
properties on a state-by-state basis as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The information as of December 31, 2003 is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at December 31, 2004 were under the Company’s control as of December 31,

multi-floor buildings with elevator access only, and a number of facilities featuring ground-floor access only.

The Company’s properties are generally situated in convenient, highly visible locations clustered around large population bases; however, due to
certain factors, the Company has a handful of locations outside the top MSA’s (Metropolitan Statistical Areas) that were developed or acquired based on the market, familiarity with the properties, or as part of a larger portfolio.

Overview

On August 17,
2004, the Company closed its initial public offering, pursuant to which it sold 20,200,000 shares of common stock, with proceeds to the Company of approximately $234,825, net of issuance costs of $17,675. As part of the offering, the Company granted
the underwriters the right to purchase up to 3,030,000 additional shares within thirty days after the offering to cover any over-allotments. On September 1, 2004, the underwriters exercised their right and purchased an additional 3,030,000 shares of
stock with proceeds to the Company of approximately $35,224, net of issuance costs of $2,651. The Company also paid additional issuance costs of $5,574. The formation transactions outlined in the offering prospectus have been completed as described
in various 8-K filings.

In connection with the initial public
offering, the existing holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class E Units in the Predecessor exchanged these Units for an aggregate of 7,939,950 shares of common stock, 1,608,437 operating partnership (“OP”) units, 3,888,843 CCS’s
and 200,046 CCU’s and $18,885 in cash. As a result of this exchange, the Predecessor became a wholly owned subsidiary of Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating Partnership”), which is a subsidiary of the Company. The transaction did
not result in a change in the carrying value of the Predecessor’s assets and liabilities because the exchange was accounted for at historical cost as a transfer of assets between companies under common control.

The Company is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by its predecessor companies to own, operate, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties. Since 1996, the Company’s fully integrated
development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of more than 130 self-storage properties. To maximize revenue-generating opportunities for the properties, the Company employs a state-of-the-art, proprietary, web-based
tracking and yield management technology called STORE. Developed by the Company’s management team, STORE enables the Company to analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across its portfolio in order to respond to changing market
conditions.

The Company derives substantially all of its
revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of its self-storage properties. The Company operates in competitive markets, where consumers have multiple self-storage self-storage properties from which to choose. Competition
has and will continue to impact the Company’s results. The Company experiences minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. The Company’s
operating results, therefore, depend materially on its ability to lease available self-storage space and on the ability of its tenants to make required rental payments. The Company believes it is able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in
local, regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of STORE, the operating management software employed at the properties.

The Company continues to evaluate a range of new growth initiatives and opportunities in order to enable it to maximize
shareholder value. These include:

•

Focus on maximizing the performance of properties through strategic, efficient and timely management. The Company plans to pursue revenue generating opportunities
on all fronts including active, real-time



revenue management, targeted marketing programs and operational efficiencies gained through technology improvements. Supported by STORE, it seeks to respond
to changing market conditions and to maximize revenue-generating opportunities through interactive rental rate management.

Continue to focus on the acquisition of self-storage properties from third parties. The Company has benefited greatly from the acquisition of existing properties. During 2004, the
Company and the Predecessor acquired 44 properties identified by its acquisition team; it continues to explore new opportunities. The acquisitions team will continue to aggressively pursue the acquisition of single properties and portfolios that it
believes can provide short and long-term shareholder value. The Company’s reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer enhances its ability to negotiate and close non-brokered, private deals. Also, its status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when
structuring deals.

•

Continue to develop new properties through joint-venture relationships. Eighteen of the Company’s properties are currently held in joint ventures. During 2004, the Company
acquired five development properties.

As of
December 31, 2004, the Company owned and operated 140 properties located in 20 states. Of the 140 properties, 122 are wholly owned and 18 are held in joint ventures with third parties. The properties are operated under the service-marked Extra Space
Storage brand name. As of December 31, 2004, the properties contained an aggregate of approximately 9.2 million net rentable square feet of space configured in approximately 87,500 separate storage units. The properties are generally situated in
convenient, highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/Northern New Jersey and San Francisco. These areas all enjoy above average population and income demographics and
high barriers to entry for new self-storage properties. The clustering of assets around these population centers enables the Company to reduce its operating costs through economies of scale. The Company considers a property to be in the lease-up
stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. A property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 85% occupancy rate, or has been open for four years.

In the Results of Operations discussion below, the Company has combined the
historical results of operations for the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2004 through August 16, 2004 with the historical results of operations for the Company for the period from August 17, 2004 through December 31, 2004 in discussing
the historical results of the operations for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2004. Comparisons to the respective prior periods are to the historical results of operations of the Predecessor.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Management of the Company has prepared the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company has summarized below those accounting policies and estimates that require its most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based on information currently available to management
and on various other assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date of this report.

•

Acquisitions of real estate and intangible assets.

When the Company acquires real estate properties, it allocates the components of the acquisition price using relative fair
values determined based on certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions impact the allocation of costs between land and different categories of land improvements as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties
in multiple property acquisitions. These allocations impact the amount of depreciation expense and gains and losses recorded on future sales of self-storage properties, and therefore the net income or loss the Company reports.



The Company determines the fair value of the real estate it acquires, including land, land improvements
and buildings, by valuing the real estate at the purchase price less any intangible assets. This fair value is then allocated to land, land improvements and buildings based on the Company’s determination of the relative fair values of these
assets.

The Company determines the fair value of the
intangible assets it acquires in accordance with purchase accounting for acquisitions by considering the value of in-place leases and the value of tenant relationships. The Company does not place a value on the in-place leases due to the
month-to-month terms of the leases. The Company values tenant relationships as two months’ projected rent (end of month rent roll), based on the stable nature of rentals and vacates in its self-storage properties and the minimal amount of time
and effort required to replace an existing tenant.

•

Useful lives of assets and amortization methods.

The Company determines the useful lives of its real estate assets (generally 39 years) based on historical and industry
experience with the lives of those particular assets and experience with the timing of significant repairs and replacement of those assets.

The Company has estimated the useful life of tenant relationships to be approximately 18 months based on experience with the period of time a tenant stays
in a property.

•

Impairment of real estate.

The Company evaluates long-lived assets, which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an
impairment. The Company compares the carrying value of these long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the
undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset.

When real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, the
Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value, net of selling costs. If, the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets which have been identified for sale, is less than the net carrying value of the
assets, a valuation allowance is established.

•

Investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures.

The Company evaluates each of its real estate ventures to determine whether it is a variable interest entity under the
provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (revised December 2003)” (“ FIN 46R”). The Company will consolidate a variable interest entity for which it
is deemed to be the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R. The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures under the equity method of accounting, as it exercises significant influence over, but does not control, these
entities under the provisions of the entities’ governing agreements. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as investments in real estate ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and
distributions.

•

Income Taxes.

The Company has been organized and operated, and intends to continue to operate, as a qualifying REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state laws.
A qualifying REIT generally does not pay corporate level income taxes on its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders, and accordingly, the Company does not pay or record as an expense income tax on the share of its taxable income that
is distributed to shareholders.

•

Allowance for doubtful accounts.

The Company has not recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts. Substantially all of its receivables are comprised of rent due from tenants.
Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on tenant’s receivables. However, collection of future receivables cannot be assured.

•

Stock based compensation.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” the Company has elected to apply the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25) and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize compensation expense for stock options when the stock
option price at the grant date is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the stock at that date.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2004 to the Year Ended December 31, 2003

Overview

Results for the year ended December 31, 2004 included the operations of 147 properties, seven of which were deconsolidated during 2004, (128 of which were
consolidated and 19 of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2003, which included the operations of 94 properties (57 of which were consolidated and 37 of which
were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method). Results for the quarter and year-ended December 31, 2004 include the results of six properties in which the Company did not own any interest and one where the Company sold its joint
venture interest in 2004. The properties were consolidated as a result of guarantees and/or puts for which the Company was liable. Five of the six properties were deconsolidated on August 16, 2004 upon the release of all guarantees and puts, and the
other property was deconsolidated on December 31, 2004. Results for both periods also included equity in earnings of real estate ventures, third-party management fees, acquisition fees and development fees.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $65,971 compared to $36,261 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an
increase of $29,710, or 81.9%. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $29,602 in property rental revenues, which includes merchandise sales, insurance administrative fees and late fees. The increase in property rental revenues consists of
$8,081 from the buyout of the certain joint venture interests (previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting), $16,777 from new acquisitions and $4,045 from increases in occupancy at lease-up properties. During the year ended
December 31, 2004, the Company and the Predecessor opened five new properties, acquired 44 new properties, acquired its joint venture partners interest in 22 properties and continued to increase the occupancy at its other lease-up properties. The
increase in stabilized property revenues consists primarily of increased rental rates.

Management fees represent 6.0% of cash collected from properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. The decrease in management fees was due to the Company purchasing its joint venture
partner’s interest Extra Space East One, LLC in 2004.

During 2004, acquisition and development fees increased by $546. The increase in acquisition fees and development fees was due to the increased volume of development relating to joint ventures in 2004. While the Company and the Predecessor
purchased 44 properties in 2004, acquired its joint venture partners interest in 22 properties the Company did not recognize any acquisition fees as these properties are wholly owned and are consolidated.

Other income represents interest income and income from truck rentals.

Expenses

Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $54,822 compared to $34,897 for the year ended December 31, 2003,
an increase of $19,925, or 57.1%. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $11,208 in property operating expenses, an increase of $4,168 in general and administrative expenses and an increase in depreciation of $8,747. These amounts were
partially offset by a decrease of $4,198 in unrecovered development/acquisition costs.

Property Operations

For the year ended
December 31, 2004, property operations were $26,066 compared to $14,858 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $11,208, or 75.4%. The increase in property operations was primarily due to increases of $2,654 from the buyout of certain
joint venture interests (previously accounted for using the



equity method of accounting), $6,306 from new acquisitions and $2,238 from lease-up properties. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company and the
Predecessor opened five new properties, acquired 44 new properties, and continued to increase the occupancy at its other lease-up properties. Existing lease-up property expenses increased due to increases in utilities, office expenses, repairs and
maintenance and property taxes due to reassessment. The increase in stabilized property expenses consists primarily of payroll and property taxes.

Unrecovered Development/Acquisition Costs and Support Payments

Unrecovered development/acquisition costs and support payments were $739 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $4,937 for the year ended
December 31, 2003, a decrease of $4,198, or 85.0%. Unrecovered development costs for 2003 included $1,520 relating to final performance guarantee payments to the joint venture partner in Extra Space West One, LLC and Extra Space East One, LLC. In
addition, the decrease was due to approximately $2,500 in costs relating to potential acquisitions, which were written off during the year ended December 31, 2003.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $12,465 compared to $8,297 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase
of $4,168, or 50.2%. This increase is due to fewer internal development expenses capitalized in 2004—$1,198, than were capitalized in 2003—$1,797, and to overhead added to prepare the Company for growth, and its ongoing public company
costs. In addition, the Company recognized $1,205 in compensation expense related to employee unit grants in 2004.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $15,552 compared to $6,805 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of
$8,747, or 128.5%. The increase results from more properties being open due to development and acquisition during 2004, than were open during the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company and the Predecessor acquired 44 properties, bought out joint
venture partners on 22 properties that had been previously accounted for on the equity method of accounting, and opened five properties in 2004.

Interest Expense and Loss on Debt Extinguishments

Interest expense and loss on debt extinguishments for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $32,014 compared to $18,746 for the year ended December 31,
2003, an increase of $13,268, or 70.8%. The increase was due primarily to additional debt and interest relating to new properties entering the lease-up stage being expensed rather than capitalized (interest was capitalized during the development
phase) and $3,523 being paid to extinguish debt. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $1,213 and $2,593, respectively. In addition, during 2004, the Company and the Predecessor acquired 44 new properties and
bought out joint venture partners on 22 properties, which increased its average outstanding debt.

Minority Interest-Fidelity Preferred Return

Minority interest-Fidelity preferred return for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $3,136 compared to $4,132 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $996, or 24.1%. The decrease was due to the redemption
of the Fidelity minority interest on August 17, 2004.

Minority Interest
Operating Partnership

Loss allocated to the Operating
Partnership represents 8.05% of the net loss subsequent to the IPO and totaled $113 for the year ended December 31, 2004.



Loss Allocated to Other Minority Interests

Loss allocated to other minority interests for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2,290 compared to $1,431 for the year
ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $859, or 60.0%. The increase was primarily due to additional losses on lease-up properties allocated to Extra Space Development (“ESD”) in 2004 under the joint venture operating agreements.

Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Ventures

Equity in earnings of real estate ventures decreased $78, or 5.3%, for the
year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease was primarily due to the Predecessor purchasing its joint venture partner’s interest in 18 self-storage facilities held by Extra Space Storage East One and West One, LLC and these facilities being
subsequently consolidated, offset by increased profitability of Extra Space West One, LLC.

Gain on the Sale of Real Estate Assets

Gain on the sale of real estate assets for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $1,749 compared to $672 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was due primarily to the Company recognizing a gain of $1,920
on the sale of its joint venture interest in a property in Laguna Hills, California in August 2004.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2003 to the Year Ended December 31, 2002

Overview

Results for the year ended December 31, 2003 included the operations of 94 properties (57 of which were consolidated and 37 of which were in joint
ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2002, which included the operations of 88 properties (54 of which were consolidated and 34 of which were in joint ventures accounted for using
the equity method). Results for both periods also included equity and earnings of real estate ventures, third-party management fees, acquisition fees and development fees.

Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $36,261 compared to $32,386 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $3,875, or 11.9%. This
increase was primarily due to an increase of $4,243 in property rental revenues.

Property rental revenues (including merchandise sales, insurance administrative fees and late fees) increased by $4,243, or 14.7%, consisting of approximately $3,840 from lease-up properties and $403 from stabilized
properties. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Predecessor opened six new properties, and continued to increase the occupancy at its other lease-up properties. The increase in stabilized property revenues consists primarily of increased
rental rates.

Management fees represent 6.0% of cash collected
from properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures.

During 2003, acquisition and development fees decreased by $268. The decrease in acquisition and development fees was primarily due to the decreased volume of acquisitions of behalf of joint ventures in 2003. This
decrease in the number of properties acquired was the result of increased competition for properties, offset by overall higher prices for the properties acquired.

Other income represents interest income and income from truck rentals.



Expenses

Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $34,897 compared to $25,146 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $9,751, or
38.8%. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $3,218 in property operating expenses, an increase of $2,381 in general and administrative expenses, and an increase of $2,999 in unrecovered development/acquisition costs and support
payments.

Property Operating Expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2003, property-operating expenses were
$14,858 compared to $11,640 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $3,218, or 27.6%. The increase was due primarily to increases in expenses of approximately $2,810 resulting from lease-up properties and approximately $408 in expenses
from stabilized properties.

During the year ended December 31,
2003, the Predecessor opened six new properties, and continued to increase the occupancy at its other lease-up properties. Existing lease-up property expenses increased due to increases in utilities, office expenses, repairs and maintenance and
property taxes due to reassessment. The increase in stabilized property expenses consists primarily of payroll and repairs and maintenance.

Unrecovered Development/Acquisition Costs and Support Payments

Unrecovered development/acquisition costs and support payments were $4,937 for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $1,938 for the year ended
December 31, 2002, an increase of $2,999, or 154.7%. Unrecovered development costs for 2003 and 2002 included $1,520 and $314, respectively, relating to final performance guarantee payments to the joint venture partner in Extra Space West One, LLC
and Extra Space East One, LLC. In addition, the increase was due to approximately $2,500 in costs relating to potential acquisitions that were written off during the year ended December 31, 2003.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003
were $8,297 compared to $5,916 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $2,381, or 40.2%. This increase is primarily due to fewer development expenses capitalized in 2003—$1,797—than were capitalized in 2002—$3,788.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2003 was
$6,805 compared to $5,652 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $1,153, or 20.4%. The increase results from more properties being open for the entire year in 2003, than were open during 2002.

Interest Expense and Loss on Debt Extinguishments

Interest expense and loss on debt extinguishments for the year ended
December 31, 2003 was $18,746 compared to $13,894 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $4,852, or 34.9%. The increase was due primarily to additional debt and interest relating to new properties entering the lease-up stage being
expensed rather than capitalized (interest was capitalized during the development phase). Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $2,593 and $2,071, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Predecessor opened six new properties, which increased the Predecessor’s average outstanding debt. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower interest rates on variable rate debt.

Minority Interest-Fidelity Preferred Return

Minority interest-Fidelity preferred return for the year ended December 31,
2003 was $4,132 compared to $3,759 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $373, or 9.9%. The increase was primarily due to an additional investment by Fidelity being outstanding for the entire year of 2003 compared to three months of
2002.

Loss allocated to other minority interests for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1,431 compared to ($100) for the year
ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $1,531. The increase was primarily due to additional losses on lease-up properties allocated to the minority investors, and to the deconsolidation in 2003 of two properties due to the release of guarantees.

Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Ventures

Equity in earnings of real estate ventures increased $494, or 50.9%, for the
year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due to the increased profitability of Extra Space West One.

Gain on the Sale of Real Estate Assets

Gain on the sale of real estate assets for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $672 compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was
due to the sale of a facility in Kings Park, New York for $6,241 to Extra Space East One, LLC.

SAME-STORE STABILIZED PROPERTY RESULTS

The Company considers same-store stabilized portfolio to consist of only those properties owned by the Company at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented and that had achieved stabilization as
of the first day of such period. The following table sets forth operating data for the same-store portfolio for the Company and the Predecessor’s same store portfolio. The Company considers the following same-store presentation to be meaningful
in regards to the 31 properties shown below. These results provide information relating to property-level operating changes without the effects of acquisitions or completed developments. As the Company continues forward as a public company, it will
have a greater population of same-store properties to which to make a comparison. Consequently, the results shown below should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance.

Comparison of the Year Ended
December 31, 2004 to the Year Ended December 31, 2003

Same-Store Rental Revenues.

Total revenues for the Company’s same-store stabilized property portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $22,597 compared to $21,861 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of
$736, or 3.4%. This increase was primarily due to increased rental rates and the Company’s ability to maintain occupancy.

Same-Store Operating Expenses.

Total operating expenses for the Company’s same-store stabilized property portfolio for the year ended December
31, 2004 were $7,385 compared to $7,189 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $196, or 2.7%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in insurance and property taxes.



Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2003 to the Year Ended December 31, 2002

Same-Store Rental Revenues.

Total revenues for the Predecessor’s
same-store stabilized property portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $21,861 compared to $21,518 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $343, or 1.6%. This increase was primarily due to increased rental rates and a slight
increase in occupancy.

Same-Store Operating Expenses.

Total operating expenses for the Predecessor’s same-store stabilized property portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $7,189 compared to $6,660 for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $529, or 7.9%. This increase
was primarily due to increased payroll, advertising, snow removal (due to heavy snow falls experienced in New England) and property taxes.

Common Contingent Share (“CCS”) and Common Contingent Unit (“CCU”) Property Performance:

As described in the Company’s Prospectus for its IPO, upon the
achievement of certain levels of net operating income with respect to 14 of the Company’s pre-stabilized properties, the Company’s CCSs and the Company’s operating partnership’s CCUs will convert into additional shares of common
stock and operating partnership units, respectively, beginning, with the quarter ending March 31, 2006. The average occupancy of these 14 properties as of December 31, 2004 was 57.5% as compared to 36.4% at December 31, 2003. The table below
outlines the performance of the properties for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Revenues for the
quarter ended December 31, 2004 increased 65.9% as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2003. Expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 increased 18.6%. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 98.6% as compared to the
quarter ended December 31, 2003. Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 48.7%.

CASH FLOWS

Comparison of the Year
Ended December 31, 2004 to the Year Ended December 31, 2003

Cash used in operating activities was ($6,158) and ($8,526) for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower cash funding requirements relating to the Company’s lease-up
properties.



Cash used in investing activities was ($261,298) and ($59,206) for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The increase in 2004 is primarily the result of acquisitions of real estate assets.

Cash provided by financing activities was $280,039 and $73,017 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2004 financing activities
consisted primarily of net proceeds from share issuances of $264,475, additional borrowings of $418,154, including borrowings to fund the purchase of 44 stabilized properties and the development of existing projects, offset by the repayment of
$325,917 of borrowings. The 2003 financing activities consisted primarily of additional borrowings of $106,323 offset by the repayment of $61,613 of borrowings.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2003 to the Year Ended December 31, 2002

Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was ($8,526) and $1,613 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to the increased net loss and use of cash for working capital in 2003. Properties acquired in 2003 and 2002 continued to increase in occupancy, but it was still necessary to fund the cash
shortfalls relating to these properties.

Cash used in
investing activities was ($59,206) and ($69,249) for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in 2003 was due primarily to the sale of a property in Kings Park, New York for $6,241 to Extra Space East One, LLC.
Development activity in 2003 was similar to 2002.

Cash
provided by financing activities was $73,017 and $66,863 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2003 was due primarily to additional net borrowings and additional equity contributions by members. These
borrowings have been primarily in the form of construction loans on development properties and mortgage loans on operating properties.

2004 OPERATIONAL SUMMARY

The 2004 year proved to be challenging for the Company. Not only did it become a public company and overcome the requisite obstacles, but it also faced
strong competition in most of the markets where it operates.

The first three months of 2004 signaled a return to increased revenues and occupancy for the Company. This was also true for most public and private self-storage operators. However, during the second quarter, the Company saw its rental
activity and corresponding occupancy begin to drop on a year-on-year basis. The Company believes this was due to strong competitive pressures in certain markets, where of the Company’s properties are located. High levels of discounting and
aggressive pricing by certain competitors continued well into the third and fourth quarter of 2004.

The Company also became more aggressive in terms of its promotional strategy, moving from site-level promotions to unit-level promotions that its software
can stringently control. This combination negatively affected second and third quarter results.

The Company instituted several in-house initiatives and marketing promotions in the third quarter. These tactics, combined with additional less-stringent
promotional rules at properties proved to stimulate occupancy and revenue growth. During the third quarter, and into the fourth quarter, the Company witnessed positively trending improvement in both revenue and occupancy on a year-on-year basis.
Despite increased promotional activity in the third and fourth quarters, promotional discounts at the 31 wholly owned, same-store properties were 24.1% below 2003 discounting levels.

The Company experienced flat move-in activity as compared to 2003, while move-out activity was slightly lower. Occupancies
remained essentially flat on a year-on-year basis. California, Florida and New Jersey were the strongest regions in terms of revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2004, while Massachusetts and Pennsylvania were the weakest.



OUTLOOK

The Company has seen marked improvement in its recent year-on-year performance with both occupancy and revenue. Though there can be no assurance that this
trend will continue, the Company believes that positive economic conditions and its use of real real-time pricing and promotions, will continue to provide the Company with the opportunity to grow revenues.

The Company anticipates increased competition from all operators, both public
and private, in all of the markets in which the Company operates in 2005. Despite this, the Company expects continued improvement in the operating climate for self-storage operators, particularly for those with well-located, highly visible, and
efficiently managed self-storage properties. The Company will continue to enhance operational processes and implement technology to maximize its effectiveness as an operator.

REVENUE OUTLOOK

2004 signaled a gradual return to increased revenues and occupancy for many operators. This was also true for the Company and the Predecessor, as
illustrated by same-store revenue growth and net operating income growth. With the use of the Company’s STORE software technology, the Company aims to achieve not the highest level of occupancy, but the highest sustainable level of revenue to
increase shareholder value. This may mean lower occupancy levels when compared on a year-on-year basis. The Company will also continue to selectively discount certain sites and units based on occupancy, availability, and competitive parameters that
are controlled through the Company’s software.

Discounting, though substantially lower in 2004 on a same-store portfolio comparison from 2003, remains an important factor for the Company. The Company’s evolving system of analyzing different data as it relates to site performance,
customer behavior, competitive variables and its operational experience will drive site-level and portfolio performance in the future.

As the Company continues to grow, media opportunities that only a few companies currently possess in the industry will become available. Currently, select
marketing programs have been targeted on a local level. The Company seeks to both continue to stretch its marketing dollar further and investigate other marketing channels to better communicate its services to prospective customers.

EXPENSE OUTLOOK

Property taxes and insurance costs were the main components of 2004’s increased operating expenses. An increase in
credit card merchant fees had both positive and negative impacts, as it signified customers placing their monthly rental purchases on an auto-pay format that eliminates manual processes for the Company’s site personnel, but also resulted in
higher fees. The Company believes that expenses such as credit card merchant fees are somewhat controllable and should be brought in line with prior years through proactive negotiating by the Company. In regards to the same-store group of
properties, the Company is forecasting no major increase in repairs and maintenance in 2005. The unknown factor regarding repairs and maintenance will be the snow removal situation in the eastern United States as a result of several major storms in
early 2005. The Company believes that its insurance costs are controllable to an extent, and is hopeful that they will decrease in the future through continued refinement of insurance and risk management processes.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $24,329 available in
cash and cash equivalents. The Company will be required to distribute at least 90% of its net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its shareholders on an annual basis to maintain its qualification as a REIT. The Company intends to use
this cash to purchase additional self-storage properties in the first quarter of 2005. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Company will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet its liquidity needs. Instead, these needs must be
met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital.



On September 9, 2004, the Company, as guarantor, and its Operating Partnership entered into a $100
million revolving line of credit (“Credit Facility”), which includes a $10 million swingline sub facility. The Credit Facility is collateralized by self-storage properties. The Operating Partnership intends to use the proceeds of the
Credit Facility for general corporate purposes and acquisitions. As of December 31, 2004, the Credit Facility has approximately $63.5 million of capacity based on the assets collateralizing the Credit Facility. The outstanding principal balance of
the Credit Facility at December 31, 2004 was $39.0 million and is due September 2007.

On October 4, 2004, the Company entered into a reverse interest rate swap with U.S. Bank National Association, relating to the Company’s existing $61,770 fixed rate mortgage due 2009 with Wachovia Bank. Pursuant
to the swap agreement, the Company will receive fixed interest payments of 4.30% and pay variable interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR plus .0655% on a notional amount of $61,770. There were no origination fees or other up front costs
incurred by the Company in connection with the swap agreement.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $473 million of debt, resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 53.2%. The Company’s variable rate instruments increased by $61.8 million upon completion
of the reverse interest rate swap. As of December 31, 2004, the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt is approximately 59.1%. The weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at December
31, 2004 is approximately 4.5%.

The Company expects to fund
its short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to shareholders, distributions to holders of OP units and interest on its outstanding indebtedness out of its operating cash flow, cash on
hand and borrowings under the Credit Facility.

Long-Term Liquidity Needs

The Company’s long-term liquidity needs consist
primarily of distributions to shareholders, new facility development, property acquisitions, principal payments under the Company’s borrowings and non-recurring capital expenditures. The Company does not expect that its operating cash flow will
be sufficient to fund its long term liquidity needs and instead expects to fund such needs out of additional borrowings, joint ventures with third parties, and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt. The Company may
also use OP Units as currency to fund acquisitions from self-storage owners who desire tax-deferral in their exiting transactions.

FINANCING STRATEGY

The Company will continue to employ leverage in its capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by its board of directors. Although its
board of directors has not adopted a policy, which limits the total amount of indebtedness that the Company may incur, it will consider a number of factors in evaluating the Company’s level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the
amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate. In making financing decisions, the Company’s board of directors will consider factors including but not limited to:

•

the interest rate of the proposed financing;

•

the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing its properties;

•

prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing;

•

the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing;

•

long-term objectives with respect to the financing;

•

target investment returns;

•

the ability of particular properties, and the Company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments;



•

overall level of consolidated indebtedness;

•

timing of debt and lease maturities;

•

provisions that require recourse and cross-collateralization;

•

corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets; and

•

the overall ratio of fixed- and variable-rate debt.

The Company’s indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse or cross-collateralized. If the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited
to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, the Company may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on the Company’s properties, or may refinance properties
acquired on a leveraged basis. The Company may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing properties, for general working capital or to purchase
additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when the Company believes it is advisable.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Except as disclosed in the notes to the Company’s financial statements, the Company does not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow
or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to the Company’s financial statements, the Company has not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor does it have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any
such entities. Accordingly, the Company is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in these relationships.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004:

Mortgage interest
payments are calculated using a weighted average interest rate of 4.7% for all fixed and 4.2% on all variable rate loans as of December 31, 2004.

SEASONALITY

The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September.
Historically, the Company’s highest level of occupancy has been as of the end of July, while its lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be
achieved for the full fiscal year.



RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123-R”), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS No. 123-R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,” and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” This statement requires the fair value of all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. SFAS No. 123-R is
effective for the Company beginning on July 1, 2005. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 123-R using the modified prospective method, which requires the recognition of expense over the remaining vesting period for the portion of awards not fully
vested as of July 1, 2005. The Company estimates its expense in the third and fourth quarters of 2005, relating to outstanding options at December 31, 2004, will be $91 per quarter.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

Market
risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The Company’s future income, cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and
international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the Company’s control.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $473 million in total debt of which $194 million is subject to variable interest rates (including the $61.8
million on which the Company has the reverse interest rate swap). If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash
flows by approximately $1.9 million annually.

Interest rate
risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company’s financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the
event of a change of that magnitude, the Company may take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no
changes in the Company’s financial structure.

The fair
value of fixed rate notes payable at December 31, 2004 was $333,579. The carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable at December 31, 2004 was $340,669.

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business

Extra Space Storage Inc. (the “Company”) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”), formed as a
Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004 to own, operate, acquire and develop self-storage facilities located throughout the United States.

The Company’s interest in its properties is held through its operating partnership Extra Space Storage LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the
“Operating Partnership”), and its primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. The Company has elected to
be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be subject to tax, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to its
shareholders.

The Company invests in self-storage facilities
by acquiring or developing wholly owned facilities or by acquiring an equity interest in real estate entities, which own facilities. At December 31, 2004, the Company had direct and indirect equity interests in 140 storage facilities located in 20
states and operating under the “Extra Space Storage” name.

The Company operates in two distinct segments: the Property Management and Development segment and the Rental Operations segment. The Company’s Property Management and Development activities include acquiring, managing, developing and
selling self-storage facilities. The Rental Operations include rental operations of self-storage facilities. No single tenant accounts for more than 5% of rental income.

Initial Public Offering

On August 17, 2004, the Company completed its initial public offering (the “Offering”) pursuant to which it sold 20,200,000 shares of common
stock, with proceeds to the Company of $234,825, net of offering costs of $17,675. As part of the Offering, the Company granted the underwriters the right to purchase an additional 3,030,000 shares within thirty days after the Offering to cover any
over-allotments. On September 1, 2004, the underwriters exercised their right and purchased 3,030,000 shares of common stock with proceeds to the Company of $35,224, net of offering costs of $2,651. The Company also paid additional offering costs of
$5,574 as part of the Offering.

In connection with the closing
of the Offering, the Company also consummated various formation transactions. These formation transactions are described in detail in this report and in the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-11 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with the Offering. The Company succeeded to the business conducted by Extra Space Storage LLC (the “Predecessor”), a Delaware limited liability company.

In connection with the Offering, the existing holders of Class A, Class B,
Class C and Class E Units in the Predecessor exchanged these Units for an aggregate of 7,939,950 shares of common stock, 1,608,437 Operating Partnership (“OP”) units, 3,888,843 contingent conversion shares (“CCSs”), 200,046
contingent conversion units (“CCUs”) and $18,885 in cash. As a result of this exchange, the Predecessor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Extra Space Storage LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”),
which was formed on May 5, 2004 and as of December 31, 2004 is a 91.95% subsidiary of the Company. The transaction did not result in a change in the carrying value of the Predecessor’s assets and liabilities because the exchange was accounted
for at historical cost as a transfer of assets between companies under common control.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2004
through August 16, 2004 and the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the results of operations and financial condition of the Company for the period from August 17, 2004 through December 31, 2004.

The consolidated financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of
accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Real Estate Assets

Real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs associated with the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of
real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized as building costs. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 was $1,213, $2,593 and $2,071, respectively. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over
their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are generally between 5 and 39 years.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of properties, the purchase
price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, are determined as if vacant, that is, at replacement cost.
Intangible assets, which represent the value of tenant relationships, are recorded at their fair values.

Because the Company’s leases are month-to-month, no value is assigned to acquired in-place leases other than the tenant relationship. The Company
measures the value of tenant relationships based on the Company’s historical experience with turnover in its facilities. The Company amortizes the tenant relationships on a straight-line basis over the estimated life that a tenant utilizes the
facility (18 months).

Intangible lease rights represent
purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases. These rights are amortized over the life of the lease.

Evaluation of Asset Impairment

The Company evaluates long-lived assets, which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment. The
Company compares the carrying value of these



Extra Space Storage Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except shares and per share data)

long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of
the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset. Management has determined no property is
impaired and no impairment charges have been recognized through December 31, 2004.

When real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value, net of selling costs. If, the estimated fair value, net of selling
costs, of the assets that have been identified for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, a valuation allowance is established.

Investments in Real Estate Ventures

For acquisitions of an interest in an entity, the Company evaluates the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a Variable Interest Entity
(“VIE”), and if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46R”). Entities that meet one or more of the
criteria listed below are considered VIEs.

•

Equity investment is not sufficient to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional third party financing;

•

The equity investors, as a group do not have the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity’s business;

•

The equity investors, as a group are not obligated to absorb the expected losses of the entity;

•

The equity investors, as a group do not have the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; and

•

The equity investors’ voting rights are not proportionate to its economic interests, and substantially all of the entity’s activities either involve or are conducted on
behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.

The Company consolidates the entities that are VIEs and the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. For entities where the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary or the entity is not
deemed a VIE and the Company’s ownership is 50% or less and has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method, i.e. at cost, increased or decreased by the Company’s share of earnings or losses,
less distributions. The Company will reconsider its determination of whether an entity is a VIE and who the primary beneficiary is if certain events occur that are likely to cause a change in the original determinations.

Annually, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value
of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment. To the
extent impairment has occurred, and it is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. No impairment charges have been recognized through
December 31, 2004.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States of America and at
times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash is comprised of escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions located in various states relating to earnest money deposits on
potential acquisitions and real estate taxes. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company has debt agreements that require the Company to have unrestricted cash of $1,500 available at all times.

Other Assets

Other assets consist primarily of equipment and fixtures, accounts receivable, deferred financing costs and capitalized
advertising costs. Depreciation of equipment and fixtures is computed on a straight-line basis over three to seven years. Deferred financing costs are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective debt agreements.
Capitalized direct response advertising costs are amortized to property operating expenses over a thirty-month period on a straight-line basis.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as
amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in
expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized
in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss), outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to
earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.

In
October 2004, the Company entered into a reverse interest rate swap agreement (“Swap Agreement”) to float $61,770 of 4.30% fixed interest rate secured notes due in June 2009. Under this Swap Agreement, the Company will receive interest at
a fixed rate of 4.30% and pay interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.655%. The Swap Agreement matures at the same time the notes are due. This Swap Agreement is a fair value hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, and the fair value of the
Swap Agreement is recorded as an asset or liability, with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related note payable. Monthly interest payments are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest expense.

The estimated fair value of the Swap Agreement at December 31, 2004 is a
liability of $532. For the year ended December 31, 2004, interest expense has been reduced by $243 as a result of the Swap Agreement.



Extra Space Storage Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except shares and per share data)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003 approximate the fair values
of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other financial instruments included in other assets, accounts payable, variable rate notes payable and other liabilities. The fair value of fixed rate notes payable at December 31, 2004 was $333,579. The
carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable at December 31, 2004 was $340,669. At December 31, 2003, the carrying value of fixed rate notes payable approximated their fair value.

Revenue and Expense Recognition

Rental revenues are recognized monthly based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally on month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents
are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Management fee revenue is recorded monthly when earned; development and acquisition fee revenue is recorded as development costs are incurred. Equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on the Company’s ownership
interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities.

The Company evaluates real estate sales for both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”. In general, sales of real
estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition; other
forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition. The Predecessor has periodically sold existing properties into real estate joint ventures or identified properties for acquisition by newly formed
joint ventures in which it retains an interest. In connection with certain of these transactions, the Predecessor and/or a significant unit holder provided certain financial guarantees to the lender; or to support a put right on a portion of the
joint venture partner’s interest that effectively provided for a return on and of their investment. These arrangements preclude sale accounting under SFAS No. 66 and, accordingly, the Predecessor has reflected these transactions using the
financing method set forth in SFAS No. 66. Under this method, the putable portions of these joint ventures partners’ interests are reflected as liabilities; the initial fair value of the joint venture partners’ non-putable residual
interests are reflected as minority interests with offsetting discounts attributed to the liabilities associated with the putable interests, “putable preferred interests in consolidated joint ventures.” These discounts are amortized using
the effective interest method over the period until the relevant put first becomes exercisable (generally a period of three to five years depending on the terms of the individual transaction). The preferred return on the putable interest
liabilities, plus the amortization of the discounts, is reflected as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The joint venture partners are allocated their proportionate share of any profits, except that losses may not be
allocated in excess of the originally ascribed basis. Concurrent with the Offering, the Company redeemed all putable interest liabilities by purchasing 100% of its partner’s interest in these properties.

Advertising Costs

The Company incurs advertising costs primarily attributable to yellow page, direct mail, internet and other advertising.
Direct response advertising costs are capitalized and amortized. The Company recognized $2,950, $1,902 and $1,058 in advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



Extra Space Storage Inc.

(Dollars in thousands, except shares and per share data)

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In
order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, among other things, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its income and assets. As a REIT, the
Company is not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income, which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to the stockholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes is included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. The Company plans to continue to operate so that it meets the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If the Company were to fail to meet these
requirements, the Company would be subject to Federal income tax. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in property operations expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations. For the year ended December 31, 2004, 100% of all distributions qualify as a return of capital.

The Company may elect to treat one or more of its existing or newly created corporate subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). In
general, a TRS of the Company may perform additional services for tenants of the Company and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging
facilities or the provision to any person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax. The Company has
elected to treat certain of its existing and newly created corporate subsidiaries as TRS’s.

Prior to August 17, 2004, the Company elected to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes. The tax effects of the Company’s operations were
passed directly to members. Therefore, no provisions for income taxes were recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Stock-Based Compensation

As permitted by SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123,” the Company has elected to measure and record compensation cost relative to employee stock option costs in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock issued to Employees,” and related interpretations and make pro forma disclosures of net loss and basic loss per share as if the fair value method of valuing stock options had been
applied. Under APB No. 25, compensation cost is recognized for stock options granted to employees when the option price is less than the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the
Company applies SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, which requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the employee stock options at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The following illustrates the pro forma effect on net loss and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended:

The pro forma amounts
shown above may not necessarily represent the impact on net income (loss) in future periods.

The fair value of options granted under the Plan was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used: dividend yield of 7.3%, expected
volatility of 22%, risk-free interest rate of 3.45%, and expected life of 5.0 years. The weighted-average fair value of options at the date of grant was $1.09.

Net Loss Per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average common shares outstanding (prior to the dilutive impact of stock options outstanding).
Diluted earnings per common share are computed using the weighted average common shares outstanding. No options were included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2004, because the effect would have been
antidilutive. Options to purchase 1,568,000 shares of common stock at $12.50 per share were outstanding at December 31, 2004.

For the periods prior to the Offering, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding includes Class A units as if the Class A units had been
converted to common stock using the initial public offering conversion ratio of one Class A unit to 0.08 shares of common stock.

The basic and diluted loss per share does not include the potential effects of the CCSs and CCUs as such securities would not have participated in
earnings for any of the periods presented. These securities will not participate in distributions until they are converted, which cannot occur prior to March 31, 2006.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net the loss attributable to common shareholders by the
weighted average shares outstanding. The net loss attributable to common shareholders represents the net loss, less the preferred return payable by the Predecessor on Class B, C and E units, less the loss on early redemption of Fidelity minority
interest. The loss on early redemption of Fidelity minority interest represents additional preferred return paid to Fidelity for the period between the redemption date of September 9,

(Dollars in thousands, except shares and per share data)

2004 and November 25, 2004. The amount was paid based on the agreement whereby Fidelity was entitled to a preferred return through November 25, 2004,
regardless of the redemption date.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123-R”), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS No. 123-R supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” This statement requires the fair value of all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in
the consolidated statement of operations. SFAS No. 123-R is effective for the Company beginning on July 1, 2005. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 123-R using the modified prospective method, which requires the recognition of expense over the
remaining vesting period for the portion of awards not fully vested as of July 1, 2005. The Company estimates its expense in the third and fourth quarters of 2005, relating to outstanding options at December 31, 2004, will be $91 per quarter.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46
(FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” This Interpretation clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to certain entities in which equity investors do
not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 requires an enterprise to
consolidate a variable interest entity if that enterprise will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both. FIN 46 also requires disclosure about
unconsolidated variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a significant variable interest. Application of FIN 46, as revised, in December 2003, is required for periods ending after December 15, 2003. In 2004, the Company adopted FIN 46R
and has evaluated its investments in joint ventures and economic interests in Extra Space Development (“ESD”) with regards to FIN 46, and has determined them to be variable interest entities. The Company is not consolidating the joint
ventures and ESD, as the Company is not the primary beneficiary.

5. INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE
VENTURES

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company and

9. PUTABLE PREFERRED INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER
MINORITY INTERESTS

On August 17, 2004, the Company
purchased its joint venture partner’s 49.5% interest in Extra Space Properties Three, LLC. Prior to the purchase of its joint venture partner’s interest, the Predecessor owned a 50.5% interest in Extra Space Properties Three, LLC. This
arrangement provided for a preferred return of 12% on certain capital provided by both the Predecessor and the joint venture partner, and thereafter returns were split based upon percentage residual interests.

The Company also purchased its joint venture partner’s interests in 15
other self-storage facilities on August 17, 2004. The Predecessor had entered into these joint venture agreements with other entities controlled by Equibase Mini Warehouse. These arrangements provided for a preferred return of either 10% or 12%,
depending on the specific agreement, on certain capital provided by the joint venture partner and thereafter returns were split based on the indicated percentage interests (generally 40% to the Predecessor and 60% to the investors).

Prior to the buyout of the Predecessor’s joint ventures partners
(entities controlled by Equibase Mini Warehouse), the Predecessor and/or a significant unit holder provided certain financial guarantees to the secured lender (generally providing for performance under the loan, including principal and interest
payments), or to support a put right on a portion of the joint venture partner’s interest after a fixed period (generally either three or five years), that effectively provided for a return on and of the preferred portion of their investment.
In addition, after a fixed period (generally either three or five years), the joint venture had the right to redeem the preferred capital at an amount equal to its unreturned contribution plus any accrued preferred return. Upon exercise of the put
or call on the preferred portion of their investment, the joint venture investors would continue to hold their residual equity interests. As a result of the put rights and guarantees, the Predecessor consolidated the properties and related debt
until the put rights and guarantees were satisfied or have expired. At December 31, 2003, all the joint venture properties were consolidated. The financial guarantees to the secured lender would generally expire upon satisfaction of the related loan
at maturity or refinancing. The put rights and related guarantees had no stated maturity and would only expire upon exercise or through redemption of the preferred interests through a capital event.

On August 17, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of joint venture
interests held by Equibase Mini Warehouse and its affiliates in seven joint ventures, which currently own an aggregate of 30 self-storage



Extra Space Storage Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except shares and per share data)

properties, for an aggregate of approximately $35,800 in cash and 114,928 OP Units issued by the Operating Partnership valued at $1,437.

Upon completion of the Offering, the Company was released from all puts and
guarantees relating to the remaining Equibase joint ventures. These guarantees and puts were transferred to Extra Space Development and a shareholder of the Company. Accordingly, these properties were deconsolidated as of August 17, 2004. The
operating results through August 16, 2004 relating to the properties that were deconsolidated are included in the consolidated statements of operations.

During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company reflected interest expense on the putable preferred interests of $4,227, $4,951 and
$2,634, respectively, including amortization of discounts ascribed at issuance of $1,043, $1,311 and $554, respectively.

During the formation of ESE and ESW, the Predecessor agreed to guarantee the financial performance of certain properties, which were acquired on behalf of
those entities. As a result of these guarantees, the Predecessor consolidated these properties until these performance guarantees were satisfied or expired. During 2003, the guarantees related to two properties were either satisfied or expired.
During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company and the Predecessor recognized $0, $1,283, and $395, respectively, of expense, related to these guarantees. These amounts are classified as a component of unrecovered development /
acquisition costs and support payments. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no active guarantees related to these properties.

The following table summarizes the putable preferred interests in consolidated joint ventures and other minority interests of the Company and the
Predecessor:

Extra Space Storage Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except shares and per share data)

Related party balances as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 are summarized as follows:

Receivables from
related parties consist of loans to properties in which the Company and the Predecessor has no equity interest and development and management fee receivables. Payables to related parties consist primarily of amounts advanced by members of the
Predecessor; in addition, a joint venture partner has made advances to the Predecessor in the form of mortgage loans used to purchase land and self-storage facilities. These related party receivables and payables bear interest at 9-12% and are due
upon demand.

As discussed in Note 8, one member of the
Predecessor has guaranteed certain borrowings of the Predecessor. The Predecessor did not pay any fees for these guarantees.

On January 1, 2004, the Predecessor distributed its equity ownership in Extra Space Development (“ESD”), a consolidated subsidiary, to the Class
A members. ESD owned 13 early-stage development properties, two parcels of undeveloped land, and a note receivable. The net book value of the distributed properties and related liabilities was approximately $15,000. The Predecessor retained a
receivable of $6,212 from ESD and recorded a net distribution of $9,000. In September 2004, ESD repaid the amounts due the Company using funds obtained through new loans on unencumbered properties. Through August 16, 2004, the Predecessor was
required to continue consolidating certain of the properties due to financial guarantees. Concurrent with the initial public offering, the Company was released from all guarantees, and the properties were deconsolidated as of August 16, 2004 (Note
9). The Company does not intend to purchase these properties in the future. During the year ended December 2004, the Company recognized management fee revenue of $26 from ESD.

During 2002, the Predecessor distributed software with a net book value of $699 to the Class A unit holders. Those members
contributed the software to a newly formed company, Centershift. During 2004 and 2003, the Predecessor advanced Centershift $0 and $1,798 under the terms of a convertible note, which bears interest at 9%. The note receivable from Centershift was
reflected as a reduction of members’ equity at December 31, 2003. On January 1, 2004, the Predecessor distributed the $4,493 (including accrued interest of $438) note receivable from Centershift to the Class A unit holders. Effective January 1,
2004, the Company entered into a license agreement with Centershift which secures a perpetual right for continued use of STORE in all aspects of the Company’s property acquisition, development, redevelopment and operational activities. During
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company paid Centershift $441, $175 and $202 respectively, for the use of Centershift’s software program STORE.

(Dollars in thousands, except shares and per share data)

The Company has determined that it has a variable interest in properties in which ESD owns or has an
ownership interest. The Company does not have an equity investment or interest, and in which it is not the primary beneficiary. This variable interest is a result of management and development contracts that are held by the Company. The variable
interest is limited to the management and development fees and there is not any additional loss that can be attributed to the Company.

12. MINORITY INTEREST IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

The Company’s interest in its properties is held through the Operating Partnership. ESS Holding Business Trust I, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Company is also a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, and controls the operations of the Operating Partnership, holding an 8.05% ownership interest therein as of
December 31, 2004. The remaining ownership interests in the Operating Partnership are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating Partnership subsequent to its formation. The Company and Operating Partnership were formed to
continue to operate and expand the business of the Predecessor.

The minority interest in the Operating Partnership represents OP Units that are not owned by the Company, which, at December 31, 2004 totaled 8.05% of the outstanding units (8.84% as of August 17, 2004). In conjunction with the formation of
the Company, certain persons and entities contributing interests in properties to the Operating Partnership received limited partnership units (“OP units”). Limited partners who received OP units in the formation transactions have the
right, commencing on or after August 17, 2005, to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of their OP units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at the time of the redemption.
Alternatively, the Company may elect to acquire those OP units in exchange for shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to anti-dilution adjustments provided in the Operating Partnership agreement. Upon consummation of the Offering,
8.84% of the carrying value of the net assets of the Predecessor ($8,481) was allocated to the minority interest. As of December 31, 2004, the Operating Partnership had 2,730,050 OP units outstanding.

CCUs do not carry any voting rights. Upon the achievement of certain
performance thresholds relating to 14 early-stage lease-up properties, all or a portion of the CCUs will be automatically converted into shares of the Company’s common stock. Initially, each CCU will be convertible on a one-for-one basis into
shares of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2006 and ending with the quarter ending December 31, 2008, the Company will calculate the net operating income from the 14 wholly
owned early-stage lease-up properties over the 12-month period ending in such quarter. Within 35 days following the end of each quarter referred to above, some or all of the CCUs will be converted so that the total percentage (not to exceed 100%) of
CCU issued in connection with the formation transactions that have been converted to common stock will be equal to the percentage determined by dividing the net operating income for such period in excess of $5.1 million by $4.6 million. If any CCU
remains unconverted through the calculation made in respect of the 12-month period ending December 31, 2008, such outstanding CCUs will be cancelled and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

13. REDEEMABLE MINORITY INTEREST—FIDELITY

Through December 31, 2003, the Predecessor, through a consolidated
subsidiary, Extra Space Properties Four, LLC, had received net cash proceeds of $14,156 (net of transaction costs of $1,403) from FREAM No. 39, LLC and Fidelity Pension Fund Real Estate Investments (collectively, “Fidelity”). The
Predecessor was accreting the discount related to the transaction costs over the five-year period ending November 25, 2006; the first date the investment was redeemable by Fidelity.

(Dollars in thousands, except shares and per share data)

This investment earned a 22% preferred return, of which, 9% was payable quarterly with the remainder
payable upon redemption. The earliest date at which the investment could be repaid without penalty at the option of the Predecessor was November 25, 2004. The investment was redeemable November 25, 2006 at the option of Fidelity. As of December 31,
2003, the Predecessor owed Fidelity $3,810, in unpaid preferred return which had been accrued and was included in the redeemable minority interest-Fidelity.

On September 9, 2004, the Operating Partnership completed its acquisition of the preferred equity interest held by Fidelity in Extra Space Properties Four
LLC. This interest was acquired for approximately $21,530 in cash, which included the preferred return through November 25, 2004. The Company recorded a loss on early redemption of $1,478.

14. MEMBERS’ AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Shareholders’ Equity

The Company’s charter provides that it can issue up to 200,000,000
shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share, 4,100,000 CCS, $.01 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. The Company’s board of directors is authorized to increase the aggregate number
of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without shareholder approval. As of December 31, 2004, 31,169,950 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding, 3,888,843 shares of CCSs were issued and outstanding and no
shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

All
shareholders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends and to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. The transfer agent and registrar for the Company’s common stock is American Stock Transfer
& Trust Company.

Unlike the Company’s shares of
common stock, CCSs do not carry any voting rights. Upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to 14 early-stage lease-up properties, all or a portion of the CCSs will be automatically converted into shares of the Company’s
common stock. Initially, each CCS will be convertible on a one-for-one basis into shares of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2006 and ending with the quarter ending December
31, 2008, the Company will calculate the net operating income from the 14 wholly owned early-stage lease-up properties over the 12-month period ending in such quarter. Within 35 days following the end of each quarter referred to above, some or all
of the CCSs will be converted so that the total percentage (not to exceed 100%) of CCS issued in connection with the formation transactions that have been converted to common stock will be equal to the percentage determined by dividing the net
operating income for such period in excess of $5.1 million by $4.6 million. If any CCS remains unconverted through the calculation made in respect of the 12-month period ending December 31, 2008, such outstanding CCSs will be cancelled and restored
to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

While any CCSs remain outstanding, a majority of the Company’s independent directors must review and approve the net operating income calculation for each measurement period and also must approve any sales of any of the 14 wholly owned
early-stage lease-up properties.

As of December 31, 2004, no
shares of preferred stock are outstanding.

Members’ Equity

Members’ profits, losses and distributions of the Predecessor were allocated in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement, as amended.
Member unit holders included members of management. Member interests were divided into four classes of units.

Class A units were common units with voting rights and no par value. These units were not redeemed at the option of the Company or the holder. There were
also non-voting Class A units held by certain employees.

During April 2004, the Predecessor granted 4,019,837 Class A Units, valued at $0.30 per unit, to certain employees, resulting in a compensation charge of $1,205. All A units were redeemed or converted to common stock as of August 17, 2004
at the option of the holder.

Class B units were preferred
units with a par value of $1.00. These units were non-convertible, non-voting and earned a 9% preferred return (non-compounding) with no current dividend paid. The 9% preferred return was paid based upon available funds, including upon liquidation
or termination. These units were not redeemed at the option of the Company or the holder. All B units were redeemed or converted to common stock as of August 17, 2004 at the option of the holder.

Class C units were preferred units with a par value of $1.00. These units
were non-convertible, non-voting and earned a 9% preferred return with current dividends paid quarterly. All C units were redeemed or converted to common stock as of August 17, 2004 at the option of the holder.

Class E units were preferred units with a par value of $1.00. These units
were non-convertible, non-voting and earned a 7% preferred return with current dividends paid quarterly. These units were redeemable after July 1, 2004 at the option of the holder. All E units were redeemed or converted to common stock as of August
17, 2004 at the option of the holder.

Class B, C and E units
did not participate in the distribution of profits after payment of the preferred return.

15. STOCK OPTION PLAN

In August 2004, the Board of Directors approved the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). Under the terms of the Plan, the exercise price of an option shall be determined by the Compensation Committee and
reflected in the applicable award agreement. Each option will be exercisable after the period or periods specified in the award agreement, which will generally not exceed 10 years from the date of grant (or five years in the case of an incentive
stock option granted to a 10% stockholder, if permitted under the Plan). Options will be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms as determined by the Compensation Committee, but under no circumstances may be exercised if such exercise
would cause a violation of the ownership limit in the Company’s charter. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, such stock options shall vest ratably over a four-year period beginning on the date of
grant.

18. DECONSOLIDATION OF ASSETS

As a result of the distribution of the Predecessor’s
equity ownership in Extra Space Development (“ESD”) and the release of all puts and guarantees on August 16, 2004, the Predecessor de-consolidated certain properties during the year ended December 31, 2004. The operating results through
August 16, 2004 relating to the properties that were deconsolidated are included in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the deconsolidation, the following assets and liabilities were removed from the Predecessor’s
accounts:

The Company has
consolidated a property in Pico Rivera, California in which neither the Company or the Predecessor has any equity or profits interest. The property was owned by the Predecessor, and sold at cost to certain former members of the Predecessor. However,
the Company and the Predecessor continued to guarantee the mortgage loan on the property, and therefore, consolidated the property’s operations until the loan guarantee was satisfied or released. In December 2004, this loan guarantee was
released and the property was deconsolidated. As a result of the deconsolidation, the following assets and liabilities were removed from the Predecessor’s accounts:

19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has an operating lease on the corporate office and owns six self-storage facilities that are subject to ground
leases. At December 31, 2004, future minimum rental payments under these non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:

The monthly rental
amount for one of the ground leases is the greater of a minimum amount or a percentage of gross monthly receipts. The Company recorded rent expense of $1,332, $277 and $206 related to these leases in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The Company and the Predecessor have guaranteed
a mortgage loan held by an unconsolidated joint venture in which the Company has a non-controlling ownership interest. This guarantee was entered into prior to January 1, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the total amount of mortgage debt relating to this
joint venture was $7,922. This mortgage loan matures May 20, 2005. If the joint venture defaulted on the loan, the Company may be forced to repay the loan. Repossessing and/or selling the self-storage facility and land that collateralizes the loan
could reimburse the Company. The estimated fair market value of the encumbered assets at December 31, 2004 is $15,000. The Company and the Predecessor had recorded no liability in relation to this guarantee as of December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003. To date the joint venture has not defaulted on its mortgage debt. The Company believes the risk of having to perform on the guarantee is remote.

The Company has guaranteed a construction loan for an unconsolidated partnership that owns a development property in Baltimore, Maryland. The property is
owned by a joint venture in which the Company has a 10% equity interest. This guarantee was entered into in November 2004. At December 31, 2004, the total amount of mortgage debt relating to this joint venture was $999. This mortgage loan matures
December 1, 2007. If the joint venture defaults on the loan, the Company may be forced to repay the loan. Repossessing and/or selling the self-storage facility and land that collateralizes the loan could reimburse the Company. The estimated fair
market value of the encumbered assets at December 31, 2004 is $2,500. The Company has recorded no liability in relation to this guarantee as of December 31, 2004. The fair value of the guarantee is not material. To date the joint venture has not
defaulted on its mortgage debt. The Company believes the risk of having to perform on the guarantee is remote.

The Company and the Predecessor have been involved in routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2004, the Company
is not presently involved in any material litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Predecessor or its properties.

20. RISK MANAGEMENT AND USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the normal course of its on-going business operations, the Company encounters economic risk. There are three main components of economic risk: interest
rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to



Extra Space Storage Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except shares and per share data)

interest rate risk on its interest-bearing liabilities. Credit risk is the risk of inability or unwillingness of tenants to make contractually required
payments. Market risk is the risk of declines in the value of properties due to changes in rental rates, interest rates or other market factors affecting the value of properties held by the Company.

The Company’s use of derivative instruments is primarily limited to the
utilization of interest rate agreements or other instruments to manage interest rate risk exposures and not for speculative purposes. The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associates with the
Company’s operating and financial structure, as well as to hedge specific transactions. The conterparties to these arrangements are major financial institutions with which the Company and its affiliates may also have other financial
relationships. The Company is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by these counterparties. However, because of their high credit ratings, the Company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet
these obligations as they come due.

In October 2004, the
Company entered into a reverse interest rate swap agreement (“Swap Agreement”) to float $61,770 of 4.30% fixed interest rate secured notes due in June 2009. Under this Swap Agreement, the Company will receive interest at a fixed rate of
4.30% and pay interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.655%. The Swap Agreement matures at the same time the notes are due. This Swap Agreement is a fair value hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, and the fair value of the Swap Agreement is
recorded as an asset or liability, with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related note payable. Monthly interest payments are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest expense.
