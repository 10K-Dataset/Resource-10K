Statements Regarding

Forward-Looking

Information

Certain information set forth in this report contains

“forward-looking

statements” within
the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Forward-looking

statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital
expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions and other information that is not historical information. In some cases,

forward-looking

statements can be identified by terminology
such as “believes,” “expects,” “estimates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “anticipates,” or “intends” or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by
discussions of strategy. We may also make additional

forward-looking

statements from time to time. All such subsequent

forward-looking

statements, whether written or
oral, by us or on our behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.

All

forward-looking

statements, including without limitation, management’s examination of historical operating trends and estimates of future earnings, are based upon our current expectations and various
assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them, but there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be
achieved. All

forward-looking

statements apply only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise

forward-looking

statements which may be
made to reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

There are a
number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the

forward-looking

statements contained in or contemplated by this report. Any

forward-looking

statements should be considered in light of the risks referenced in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” below. Such factors include, but are not limited to:

•

adverse changes in general economic conditions, the real estate industry and in the markets in which we operate;

•

failure to close pending acquisitions on expected terms, or at all;

•

the effect of competition from new and existing stores or other storage alternatives, which could cause rents and occupancy rates to decline;

•

difficulties in our ability to evaluate, finance, complete and integrate acquisitions and developments successfully and to lease up those stores, which could adversely affect our profitability;

•

potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;

•

the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national, state, and local laws and regulations including, without limitation, those governing Real Estate Investment Trusts (“REITs”), tenant reinsurance
and other aspects of our business, which could adversely affect our results;

•

disruptions in credit and financial markets and resulting difficulties in raising capital or obtaining credit at reasonable rates or at all, which could impede our ability to grow;

•

increased interest rates and operating costs;

•

the failure to effectively manage our growth and expansion into new markets or to successfully operate acquired properties and operations;

•

reductions in asset valuations and related impairment charges;

•

the failure of our joint venture partners to fulfill their obligations to us or their pursuit of actions that are inconsistent with our objectives;

•

the failure to maintain our REIT status for federal income tax purposes;



•

economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism, which could adversely affect our business plan; and

•

difficulties in our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and management members.

The

forward-looking

statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future
performance, taking into account all information currently available to us. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties and can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known
to us. If a change occurs, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may vary materially from those expressed in our

forward-looking

statements. You should carefully consider these
risks before you make an investment decision with respect to our securities.

We disclaim any duty or obligation to update or
revise any

forward-looking

statements set forth in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

to reflect new information, future events or otherwise.

PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Extra Space Storage Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) is a fully integrated,

self-administered

and

self-managed

real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004, to own, operate, manage, acquire,
develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties (“stores”). We closed our initial public offering (“IPO”) on August 17, 2004. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
“EXR.”

We were formed to continue the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries, which had engaged in the

self-storage

business since 1977. These companies were reorganized after the consummation of our IPO and various formation transactions. As of December 31, 2015, we held ownership interests in 999 operating
stores. Of these operating stores, 746 are

wholly-owned

and 253 are owned in joint venture partnerships. An additional 348 operating stores are owned by third parties and operated by us in exchange for a
management fee, bringing the total number of operating stores which we own and/or manage to 1,347. These operating stores are located in 36 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico and contain approximately 101 million square feet of net
rentable space in approximately 896,000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 800,000 tenants.

We operate in three
distinct segments: (1) rental operations; (2) tenant reinsurance; and (3) property management, acquisition and development. Our rental operations activities include rental operations of stores in which we have an ownership interest.
Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in the Company’s stores. Our property management, acquisition and development activities include managing, acquiring, developing and
selling stores.

Substantially all of our business is conducted through Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating
Partnership”). Our primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). To the extent we continue to qualify as a REIT we will not be subject to tax, with certain exceptions, on our net taxable income that is distributed to our
stockholders.

We file our annual report on

Form 10-K,

quarterly reports on

Form 10-Q,

current reports on

Form 8-K,

and all amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You may obtain



copies of these documents by visiting the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, by calling the SEC at

1-800-SEC-0330

or by accessing the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are furnished to the SEC, we
make copies of these documents available to the public free of charge through our website at www.extraspace.com, or by contacting our Secretary at our principal offices, which are located at 2795 East Cottonwood Parkway, Suite 400, Salt Lake
City, Utah 84121, telephone number (801) 365-4600.

Acquisition of SmartStop

On October 1, 2015, we completed the previously announced acquisition of SmartStop Self Storage, Inc. (“SmartStop”), a public
non-traded REIT. SmartStop stockholders received $13.75 per share in cash, which represents a total purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion. We paid approximately $1.3 billion and the remaining consideration came from the sale of certain assets
by SmartStop immediately prior to the closing. As a result of the acquisition, we acquired 122 stores and assumed the management of 43 stores previously managed by SmartStop.

Management

Members of our executive
management team have significant experience in all aspects of the

self-storage

industry, having acquired and/or developed a significant number of stores since before our IPO. Our executive management team and
their years of industry experience are as follows: Spencer F. Kirk, Chief Executive Officer, 18 years; Scott Stubbs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 15 years; Samrat Sondhi, Executive Vice President and Chief
Operating Officer, 12 years; Gwyn McNeal, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, 10 years; James Overturf, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, 17 years; Joseph D. Margolis, Executive Vice President and Chief
Investment Officer, 10 years; and Kenneth M. Woolley, Executive Chairman, 35 years.

Our executive management team and board of
directors have a significant ownership position in the Company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 4,923,970 shares or 3.9% of our outstanding common stock as of February 18, 2016.

Industry & Competition

Stores
offer

month-to-month

storage space rental for personal or business use and are a

cost-effective

and flexible storage alternative.
Tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited, exclusive access. Tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units.

Self-storage

unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet, with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet. Stores generally have

on-site

managers who
supervise and run the

day-to-day

operations, providing tenants with assistance as needed.

Self-storage

provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due
to life changes, or simply because of a need for storage space. The mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who
are not yet settled into a permanent residence. Items that residential tenants place in

self-storage

range from cars, boats and recreational vehicles, to furniture, household items and appliances. Commercial
tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods, records, inventory or storage for seasonal goods.

Our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business, making

high-density,

high-traffic

population centers ideal locations for stores. A store’s perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are
also contributing factors to a



site’s ability to successfully secure rentals. Although most stores are leased to tenants on a

month-to-month

basis, tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time.

The

self-storage

business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been
in late February and early March.

Since inception in the early 1970’s, the

self-storage

industry has experienced significant growth. The self-storage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years. According to the

Self-Storage

Almanac (the “Almanac”), in
2008, the national average physical occupancy rate was 80.3% of net rentable square feet, compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 90.2% in 2015.

We have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire stores, especially for brokered portfolios. Aggressive bidding practices have
been commonplace between both public and private entities, and this competition will likely continue.

The industry is also characterized
by fragmented ownership. According to the Almanac, the top ten

self-storage

companies in the United States owned approximately 17.4% of the total U.S. stores, and the top 50

self-storage

companies owned approximately 21.9% of the total U.S. stores as of December 31, 2015. We believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future. We
also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals.

We are the second
largest

self-storage

operator in the United States. We are one of five public

self-storage

REITs along with CubeSmart, National Storage Affiliates, Sovran

Self-Storage, Inc.

and Public Storage Inc.

Long-Term

Growth and
Investment Strategies

Our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to
achieve sustainable

long-term

growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize

long-term

stockholder value. We continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and
opportunities, including the following:

•

Maximize the performance of our stores through strategic, efficient and proactive management.

We pursue

revenue-generating

and

expense-minimizing

opportunities in our operations. Our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology system’s ability to
provide

real-time,

interactive rental rate and discount management. Our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs, which we
believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.

•

Acquire stores.

Our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of

multi-store

portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value.
We have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. In addition, we believe our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals. We continue to bid
on available acquisitions and are seeing increasing prices. However, we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value.

•

Expand our management business.

Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint. We believe this expanded footprint enables us
to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. We pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an
opportunity arises to acquire such stores.

We expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new store
acquisitions. We plan to finance future acquisitions through a combination of cash, borrowings under the Credit Lines, traditional secured and unsecured mortgage financing, joint ventures and additional debt or equity offerings.

Joint Venture Financing

We own
253 of our stores through joint ventures with third parties, including affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. In each joint venture, we generally manage the

day-to-day

operations of the underlying stores and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint
venture. Our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business. Under the operating agreements for the joint ventures, we maintain the right to receive between 2.0% and 96.7% of
the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners and the Company have received a predetermined return, and between 17.0% and 96.7% of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners and the
Company have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return. Most joint venture agreements include

buy-sell

rights, as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of stores
by the joint venture.

Disposition of Stores

We will continue to review our portfolio for stores or groups of stores that are underperforming or are not strategically located, and
determine whether to dispose of these stores to fund other growth. As of December 31, 2015, we had seven stores that were categorized as held for sale.

Regulation

Generally, stores are subject
to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures. Changes in any of these laws or regulations, as well as changes in laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and
Compensation Liability Act, which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores, or laws affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation
may result in significant



unanticipated expenditures, loss of stores or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal
requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the stores, or restrict further
renovations thereof, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any

non-complying

feature, thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures. To the extent our stores are not in compliance, we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ADA.

Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state
in accordance with the

McCarran-Ferguson

Act, and are subject to the

Gramm-Leach-Bliley

Act and the privacy regulations
promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.

Store management activities are often subject to state real estate
brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.

Changes in any of the laws
governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of February 18, 2016,
we had 3,209 employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

An investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors
should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report before trading in our securities. If any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur, our business,
operating results, prospects and financial condition could be harmed.

Our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate
investments. We are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our stores. There are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate, including the following:

Risks Related to Our Stores and Operations

Adverse
economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results.

Our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our stores. Adverse economic or other
conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts. If our stores fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements, including
operating and other expenses, debt service and capital expenditures, our net income, funds from operations (“FFO”), cash flow, financial condition, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities
could be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the operating performance of our stores:

•

the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate, which may be adversely impacted by, among other factors, industry slowdowns, relocation of businesses and
changing demographics;



•

periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates, or declining demand for

self-storage

or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in
a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults;

•

a decline of the current economic environment;

•

local or regional real estate market conditions, such as competing stores, the oversupply of

self-storage

or a reduction in demand for

self-storage

in a particular area;

•

perceptions by prospective users of our stores of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our stores and the neighborhoods in which they are located;

•

increased operating costs, including the need for capital improvements, insurance premiums, real estate taxes and utilities;

•

the impact of environmental protection laws;

•

changes in tax, real estate and zoning laws; and

•

earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, terrorist acts, civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses.

If we are unable to promptly

re-let

our units or if the rates upon such

re-letting

are significantly lower than expected, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Virtually all of our leases are on a

month-to-month

basis. Any
delay in

re-letting

units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, lower than expected rental rates upon

re-letting

could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth.

We depend upon our

on-site

personnel to maximize
tenant satisfaction at each of our stores, and any difficulties we encounter in hiring, training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance.

We had 2,716 field personnel as of February 18, 2016 in the management and operation of our stores. The general professionalism of our
store managers and staff are contributing factors to a store’s ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants. We also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure stores. If we are unable to successfully recruit, train
and retain qualified field personnel, the quality of service we strive to provide at our stores could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance.

Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow.

We maintain comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders), extended coverage and
rental loss insurance with respect to our stores. Certain types of losses, however, may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war or terrorism. Should an
uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store. In addition, if any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to
our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.

Increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income.

Costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us. Increases in
income, property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under



leases and may reduce our net income, FFO, cash flow, financial condition, ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders, and the trading
price of our securities. Similarly, changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on stores or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated
expenditures, which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities
associated with operating our stores may affect our results of operations.

Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws,
ordinances and regulations, owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property. Such laws often impose such liability
without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such substances or materials. The presence of such substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect
the owner’s or operator’s ability to lease, sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for
the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials
into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real stores for personal injury associated with

asbestos-containing

materials.

Certain environmental laws also impose liability, without regard to knowledge or fault, for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or
other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property. Moreover, the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal
injuries or property damages that may result from such releases, as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases.

Certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous
materials and other regulated substances. For example, environmental laws govern the management of

asbestos-containing

materials and

lead-based

paint. Failure to comply
with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions.

No assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect
to any of our stores reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of our stores did not create any material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to
any one or more of our stores. There also exists the risk that material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future. Finally, future laws, ordinances or
regulations and future interpretations of existing laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability.

Costs
associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses.

Under the ADA,
places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws may also require
modifications to our stores, or restrict certain further renovations of the stores, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants
and also could result in an order to correct any

non-complying

feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our stores to determine
our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ADA or other legislation, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring
the facility into compliance. If



we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or other legislation, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our securities and our ability to
satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.

Our tenant reinsurance
business is subject to significant governmental regulation, which may adversely affect our results.

Our tenant reinsurance
business is subject to significant governmental regulation. The regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, to promulgate, interpret and implement regulations, and to evaluate compliance
with regulations through periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers. As a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction, we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or
all of our reinsurance activities, or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We face competition for the acquisition of stores and other assets, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of
these acquisitions.

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of stores
and other assets, including national, regional and local operators and developers of stores. These competitors may drive up the price we pay for stores or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those stores or assets themselves.
In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In addition, the number of
entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment in stores may increase. This competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them. Because of an increased interest in

single-store

acquisitions among

tax-motivated

individual purchasers, we may pay higher prices if we purchase single stores in comparison with portfolio acquisitions. If we pay
higher prices for stores or other assets, our profitability will be reduced.

We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable
acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth.

Our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our
business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. We may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets
that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price.

Our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant
risks:

•

competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital, including other

publicly-traded

REITs and institutional investment funds;

•

competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability;

•

the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions;

•

failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all;

•

we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired stores; and



•

we may acquire stores subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for

clean-up

of
undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the stores and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the stores.

In addition, strategic decisions by us, such as acquisitions, may adversely affect the price of our securities.

We may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired stores.

We have acquired many stores in the past, and we expect to continue acquiring stores in the future. If we acquire any stores, we will be
required to integrate them into our existing portfolio. The acquired stores may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated, may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert management’s attention
away from

day-to-day

operations, which could impair our operating results as a whole.

We do not always obtain independent appraisals of our stores, and thus the consideration paid for these stores may exceed the value that may be
indicated by

third-party

appraisals.

We do not always obtain

third-party

appraisals in connection with our acquisition of stores and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those stores may exceed the value determined by

third-party

appraisals. In such cases, the value of the stores was determined by our senior management team.

Our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns, which would harm our operating results and reduce the
amount of funds available for distributions.

To the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities, we will be
subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects:

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all;

•

we may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;

•

we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations; and

•

occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped stores may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investment not being profitable.

In deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected
future performance of the store. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed store as quickly as expected
or at all. Any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results, liquidity and financial condition, which could result in a
decline in the value of our securities.

We may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our
development and redevelopment projects. If our reputation in the

self-storage

industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced, our ability to
develop or redevelop stores could be affected, which would limit our growth.

We rely on information technology in our operations,
and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.

We rely on
information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial



transactions and records, personally identifiable information, and tenant and lease data. We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We rely on
commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our
information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally
identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized
disclosure of confidential information. While, to date, we have not experienced a security breach, this risk has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have
increased. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result,
subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Risks Related to
Our Organization and Structure

Our business could be harmed if key personnel with

long-standing

business
relationships in the

self-storage

industry terminate their employment with us.

Our success
depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team, who have substantial experience in the

self-storage

industry. In addition, our ability to acquire or develop stores in the future
depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners, such as affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. There is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by
us. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers. The loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects.

We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent, which may subject us to
different risks.

We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without
the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this document. A change in our
investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations.

If other

self-storage

companies convert to an UPREIT structure or if tax laws change, we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions.

Because we are structured as an UPREIT, we are a more attractive acquirer of stores to

tax-motivated

sellers than our competitors that are not structured as UPREITs. However, if other

self-storage

companies restructure their holdings to become UPREITs, this competitive advantage will disappear. In addition,
new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), or the U.S. Treasury Department that could affect the attractiveness of our UPREIT structure so that it
may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions.

Tax indemnification obligations may require the Operating Partnership to maintain certain
debt levels.

We have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to
the Operating Partnership upon acquisition by the Company, including making available the opportunity to (1) guarantee debt or (2) enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation. We have agreed to these provisions
in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions. These obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business.



Our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole

decision-making

authority.

As of December 31, 2015, we held interests in 253 operating
stores through joint ventures. Some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole

decision-making

authority, our reliance on

co-venturers

financial conditions and disputes between us and our

co-venturers.

We expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring
existing stores. In such event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole

decision-making

authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. The

decision-making

authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners, is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners
or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners. In addition, investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility
that partners or

co-venturers

might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or

co-venturers

may have economic or other
business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions,
such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or

co-venturer

would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or

co-venturers

may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by or
disputes with partners or

co-venturers

might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of
our

third-party

partners or

co-venturers,

which could harm our financial condition.

Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our Operating Partnership.

Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, and our Operating Partnership
or any partner thereof. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, we, through our

wholly-owned

subsidiary, have fiduciary duties, as a general partner, to our Operating Partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Our duties, through our

wholly-owned

subsidiary, as a general partner to our Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our Company. The partnership agreement of our
Operating Partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our Company or the limited partners in our Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally
requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness, and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner
from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest.

Additionally, the partnership agreement
expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we, our direct

wholly-owned

Massachusetts business trust subsidiary, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, nor any of our or their
trustees, directors or officers, will be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we, or such trustee, director or
officer, acted in good faith. In addition, our Operating Partnership is required to indemnify us, our affiliates and each of our respective trustees, officers, directors, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all
claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership, provided that our Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (1) willful misconduct
or a knowing violation of the law, (2) any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the
person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful.



The provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to
be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties
that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement.

Certain provisions of Maryland law and our organizational
documents, including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter, may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction.

Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our
qualification as a REIT and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common stock or 7.0% (by value or by number of shares,
whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding capital stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit. However, our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership
limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. These restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or
to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Different ownership
limits apply to the family of Kenneth M. Woolley, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing; to Spencer F. Kirk, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed
for the benefit of the foregoing; and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter.

Our board of directors has the power to
issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders.

Our charter authorizes
our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval. In
addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could issue
additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or
otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and
officers are limited.

Maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his
or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter eliminates our
directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a
final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. Our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a
result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers.

To the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders could recognize an increased
capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock.

Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits
and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a U.S. stockholder under current U.S. federal income tax law to the extent those



distributions do not exceed the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in his, her, or its common stock, but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis. If
distributions result in a reduction of a stockholder’s adjusted basis in such holder’s common stock, subsequent sales of such holder’s common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due
to the reduction in such adjusted basis.

Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our primary business involves the ownership and operation of stores.

Our current strategy is to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop only stores. Consequently, we are subject to risks inherent in
investments in a single industry. Because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid, this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change. Decreases in market
rents, negative tax, real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs, lower the value of our investments and decrease our income, which would adversely affect our business, financial
condition and operating results.

Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the
performance of our stores.

Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more
stores in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other
factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any store for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be
acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a store.

We may
be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a store can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a store, we may agree to
transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that store for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that store. These transfer restrictions would
impede our ability to sell a store even if we deem it necessary or appropriate.

Any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly
longer to yield

income-producing

returns, if at all, and may result in additional costs to us to comply with

re-zoning

restrictions or environmental regulations.

We have invested in the past, and may invest in the future, in unimproved real property. Unimproved properties generally take
longer to yield

income-producing

returns based on the typical time required for development. Any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with

re-zoning

the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups. Any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an

income-producing

return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating
expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results.

Any negative perceptions of the

self-storage

industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price.

To the extent
that the investing public has a negative perception of the

self-storage

industry, the value of our securities may be negatively impacted, which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value
of our assets.



Risks Related to Our Debt Financings

Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us.

Uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing
debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects. A downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive
financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell, as prospective buyers may
experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.

Required payments of principal and interest on borrowings
may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness. We may incur additional debt in connection
with future acquisitions and development. We may borrow under our Credit Lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores. Additionally, we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing
indebtedness upon maturity and, therefore, we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity and/or debt offerings. Further, we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a REIT or
to make our expected distributions.

If we are required to utilize our Credit Lines for purposes other than acquisition activity, this
will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth. Therefore, our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:

•

our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;

•

we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT;

•

we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;

•

because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense;

•

we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our stores, possibly on disadvantageous terms;

•

after debt service, the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced;

•

our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt;

•

we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns, reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;

•

we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our stores that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases;

•

we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees;

•

we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and

•

our default under any one of our mortgage loans with

cross-default

or

cross-collateralization

provisions could result in a default on other
indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other stores.



Increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our
ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders.

As of December 31, 2015, we had
approximately $3.6 billion of debt outstanding, of which approximately $1.1 billion, or 31.4% was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). This variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of
approximately 2.1% per annum. Increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions. For example, if market rates of interest on this
variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points (excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors), the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7.3 million annually.

Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.

In certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements. Hedging involves
risks, such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make
cash distributions to our stockholders.

Risks Related to Qualification and Operation as a REIT

To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may be forced to borrow funds on a

short-term

basis during
unfavorable market conditions.

To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net
taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains, and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise
tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. While historically we
have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a REIT is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock.
Assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds on a

short-term

basis, or possibly

long-term,

to meet the REIT
distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, or the effect of

non-deductible

capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments.

Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.

The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual U.S. stockholders is 20%. Dividends paid by
REITs, however, are generally not eligible for the reduced rates. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than
investments in the stocks of

non-REIT

corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our securities.

In addition, the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate
dividends, which could negatively affect the value of our stores.

Possible legislative or other actions affecting REITs could adversely affect our
stockholders.

The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the
legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may



have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our
stockholders will be changed.

The power of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse
consequences to our stockholders.

Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT
election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable
income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders.

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.

We believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code. If
we fail to qualify as a REIT or lose our qualification as a REIT at any time, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

we also could be subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to
stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that our U.S. individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates, and our
U.S. corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject, in each case, to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income
tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code in order to maintain our REIT status, we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of $50,000 or more for each such failure.
As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our securities.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only
limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code is greater in the case of a REIT that, like us, holds its
assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements,
including requirements regarding the composition of our assets, the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets, some of which are
not susceptible to precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains, and we will be
subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income including capital gains. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely
affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a REIT for U.S.



federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. Although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is
intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service regarding our qualification as a REIT.

We will pay some taxes.

Even though we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on
our income and property. Extra Space Management, Inc. manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties. We, jointly with Extra Space Management, Inc., elected to treat Extra Space Management, Inc. as a taxable
REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) of our Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation, and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us. ESM Reinsurance Limited, a

wholly-owned

subsidiary of Extra Space Management, Inc., generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax. In addition, we will be subject to a
100% penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants, our taxable REIT subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for
sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Also, if we sell property as a dealer (i.e., to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business), we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales.
While we don’t intend to sell stores as a dealer, the IRS could take a contrary position. To the extent that we are, or our taxable REIT subsidiary is, required to pay U.S. federal, state or local taxes, we will have less cash available for
distribution to stockholders.

Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.

To qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our
income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities. Thus,
compliance with the REIT requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits.

Item 2.

Properties

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or had ownership interests in 999
operating stores. Of these stores, 746 are

wholly-owned

and 253 are held in joint ventures. In addition, we managed an additional 348 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own
and/or manage to 1,347. These stores are located in 36 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. We receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 6.0% of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party
sites. As of December 31, 2015, we owned and/or managed approximately 101 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 896,000 separate storage units. Approximately 70% of our stores are clustered around large
population centers, such as Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco/Oakland. These markets
contain

above-average

population and income demographics for stores. The clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. Our
acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence.

We consider a store to be in the

lease-up

stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy,
but before it has achieved stabilization. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80% occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1, or has been open for three years.



As of December 31, 2015, approximately 800,000 tenants were leasing storage units at the
1,347 operating stores that we own and/or manage, primarily on a

month-to-month

basis, providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions
permit. Existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually, for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends. Although leases are

short-term

in duration, the typical tenant
tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time. For stores that were stabilized as of December 31, 2015, the average length of stay was approximately 13.7 months.

The average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores, net of discounts and bad debt, was $14.83 for the
year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $14.02 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Average annual rent per square foot for new leases was $15.41 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $14.35 for the year ended
December 31, 2014. The average discounts, as a percentage of rental revenues, during these periods were 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.

Our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where
it is located. Most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities, a mix of both

drive-up

buildings and

multi-floor

buildings. We have a number of

multi-floor

buildings with elevator access only, and a number of facilities featuring

ground-floor

access only.

The following table presents additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized stores by state as of December 31, 2015 and
2014. The information as of December 31, 2014, is on a pro forma basis as though all the stores owned at December 31, 2015, were under our control as of December 31, 2014.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in various legal proceedings and are subject to
various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. In accordance with applicable
accounting guidance, management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts
accrued. The estimated loss, if any, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. Therefore, any estimate(s) of loss disclosed below represents
what management believes to be an estimate of loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria and does not represent our maximum loss exposure. We could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period, notwithstanding the fact that we are currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against us.

We currently have several legal proceedings pending against us that include causes of action alleging wrongful foreclosure, violations of
various state specific self-storage statutes, and violations of various consumer fraud acts. As a result of these litigation matters, we recorded a liability of $850,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014, which is included in other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

On February 18, 2016, the closing price of our common stock as reported by the NYSE was $84.55. At
February 18, 2016, we had 335 holders of record of our common stock. Certain shares of the Company are held in “street” name and accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included in the foregoing
number.

Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive distributions when declared by our board of directors out of any assets
legally available for that purpose. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our “REIT taxable income,” which is generally equivalent to our net taxable ordinary income, determined without regard to the deduction for
dividends paid to our stockholders annually in order to maintain our REIT qualification for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Information
about our equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference in Item 12 of Part III of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

On April 15, 2015, we entered into a contribution agreement to acquire 22 stores located in Arizona and Texas (the
“Properties”). The Properties include approximately 1.7 million square feet of net rentable space in approximately 13,500 self-storage units, which were approximately 81.7% occupied as of June 30, 2015. The aggregate
consideration paid to acquire the Properties is valued at approximately $177.7 million, excluding transaction costs, including the issuance by the Operating Partnership to the contributors of 1,504,277 common Operating Partnership units (“OP
Units”), with a total value of $101.7 million.

On June 18, 2015, our Operating Partnership issued 71,054 OP Units in connection
with the acquisition of a store located in Florida. The store was acquired in exchange for the OP Units, valued at $4.8 million, and approximately $12.7 million of cash.

On October 1, 2015, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of SmartStop, a public non-traded REIT pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 15, 2015. Under the terms of the



Merger Agreement, SmartStop shareholders received $13.75 per share in cash. Certain unit holders elected to exchange their SmartStop OP units for 376,848 of the Company’s OP units for a
total value of approximately $25.5 million.

On November 13, 2015, our Operating Partnership issued 91,434 OP Units in connection
with the acquisition of a store located in Texas. The store was acquired in exchange for the OP Units, valued at $7.2 million, and approximately $7.1 million of cash.

The terms of the OP Units are governed by the Operating Partnership’s Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership. The
OP Units will be redeemable, at the option of the holders following the expiration of a lock-up period commencing on the date of issuance and ending on August 15, 2016, which redemption obligation may be satisfied, at our option, in cash or
shares of our common stock.

The OP Units were issued in private placements in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
We make statements in this section that are

forward-looking

statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of

forward-looking

statements, see the section in this

Form 10-K

entitled “Statements Regarding

Forward-Looking

Information.” Certain risk factors may cause actual results,
performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this

Form 10-K

entitled “Risk
Factors.” Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data.

Overview

We are a fully integrated,

self-administered

and

self-managed

real estate investment trust, or REIT, formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed stores.

At December 31, 2015, we owned, had ownership interests in, or managed 1,347 operating stores in 36 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto
Rico. Of these 1,347 operating stores, we owned 746, we held joint venture interests in 253 stores, and our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc., operated an additional 348 stores that are owned by third parties. These
operating stores contain approximately 101 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 896,000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 800,000 tenants.

Our stores are generally situated in convenient, highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as Atlanta,
Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco/Oakland. These areas all enjoy above average population growth
and income levels. The clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. We consider a store to be in the

lease-up

stage after it has
been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. A store is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80% occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1, or has been open for three years.

To maximize the performance of our stores, we employ

industry-leading

revenue management systems.
Developed by our management team, these systems enable us to analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions. We believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively
manage revenues.

We derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our

wholly-owned

stores, from management fees on the stores we manage for

joint-venture

partners and unaffiliated third parties, and from our tenant reinsurance program. Our
management fee is generally equal to approximately 6.0% of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores. We also receive an asset management fee of 0.5% of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures.

We operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose. Competition has impacted, and will
continue to impact, our store results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. Our operating results depend materially on our ability to
lease available

self-storage

units, to actively manage unit rental rates, and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to
changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our

industry-leading

technology systems.



We continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to
maximize stockholder value. Our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following:

•

Maximize the performance of our stores through strategic, efficient and proactive management.

We pursue

revenue-generating

and

expense-minimizing

opportunities in our operations. Our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology system’s ability to
provide

real-time,

interactive rental rate and discount management. Our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs, which we
believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.

•

Acquire stores.

Our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of

multi-store

portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value.
We have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. In addition, we believe our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals. We continue to see
available acquisitions on which to bid and are seeing increasing prices. However, we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value.

•

Expand our management business.

Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint. We believe this expanded footprint enables us
to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. We pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an
opportunity arises to acquire such stores.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies:

CONSOLIDATION:

Arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities
(“VIEs”). An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

A VIE is created when
(i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity’s equity holders as a group either:
(a) lack the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they
occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an entity is deemed to be a VIE, the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest, or combination of variable interests, that
provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.

We have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be
created under condition (i), (ii) (b) or (c) of the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, we have performed a qualitative analysis, including considering which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most
significant to the economic performance of each VIE and whether that party has the



obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the
assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with our financial statements. As of December 31, 2015, we had no consolidated VIEs. Additionally, our Operating Partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are VIEs under
condition (ii)(a) above. Since the Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts, these VIEs are not consolidated.

REAL ESTATE ASSETS:

Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs
associated with the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the
life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the

straight-line

method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements,
which are generally between 5 and 39 years.

In connection with our acquisition of stores, the purchase price is allocated to the
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, is determined as if vacant. Intangible
assets, which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases. We measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of
time required to replace existing customers, which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities. Debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates.

Acquisition-related

transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

Intangible lease rights include:
(1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases; and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on six
stores where the ground leases were assumed by the Company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases. The value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the
lease terms.

EVALUATION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT:

Long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or
circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. We review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. We focus on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a
significant amount. For these stores, we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. In addition, we review stores in the

lease-up

stage and compare actual operating results to original projections.

When we determine that an
event that may indicate impairment has occurred, we compare the carrying value of the related

long-lived

assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment
loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the
assets.

When real estate assets are identified as held for sale, we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of
the assets, net of selling costs. If the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, we would recognize a loss on the disposal group
classified as held for sale. The operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented.



INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED REAL ESTATE VENTURES:

Our investments in real estate joint
ventures where we have significant influence but not control, and joint ventures which are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Under the equity method, our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses
and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the purposes of presentation in the statement of
cash flows, we follow the “look through” approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific
distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture’s sale of assets) in which case it is reported as an investing activity.

Our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may
be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. An investment is impaired if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment, using significant unobservable inputs, is less than its carrying value.
To the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:

The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use
of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to
hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk
are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income, outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified
to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.

REVENUE AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION:

Rental revenues are recognized as
earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally on

month-to-month

terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a

straight-line

basis over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period. Late charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck
rentals are recognized in income when earned. Management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements. Equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized
based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. Interest income is recognized as earned.

Property expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as
incurred. We accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts, estimates and historical trends. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected.

Tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage. We record an unpaid claims liability at the end
of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history. The unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end, including both reported but unpaid
claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported. We use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received. The administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and
includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported. Annually, a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid



claims liability. Prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known. The impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations. The
unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value. Each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program. Tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand
dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee. Our exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant. We purchase reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount on any one event. We do not currently
have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements.

INCOME TAXES:

We have elected to be treated as a REIT under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, among other things, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests
regarding the nature of our income and assets. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders. We plan to continue to
operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet these requirements, we would be subject to federal income tax. We are subject to
certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

We have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries, Extra Space Management, Inc., as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”).
In general, our TRS may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or

non-real

estate related business. A TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In
April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-08, “

Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting
Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.

” Under this guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. The guidance also requires
new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2015. We have not previously had discontinued
operations and as such, this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB
issued ASU 2014-09, “

Revenue from Contracts with Customers,

” which amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International
Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 outlines a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures
regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities can transition to the standard
either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the standard. The new standard will now become effective for annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. The Company has not yet selected a transition method. Management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our
consolidated financial statements.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, “

Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis.”

This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. ASU 2015-02 amends the criteria for determining if



a service provider possesses a variable interest in a variable interest entity (“VIE”), and eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership.
We do not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-03, “

Interest—Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,

” which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability. The new guidance only impacts financial statement presentation. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2016 and allows for early adoption. We adopted this guidance October 1, 2015 on a
retrospective basis. As a result $20,120 of unamortized debt issuance costs that had been included in the Other assets line on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 are now presented as direct deductions from the carrying
amounts of the related debt liabilities.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, “

Intangibles—Goodwill and
Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40)—Customers Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement,

” which provides guidance regarding the accounting for fees paid by a customer in cloud computing arrangements. If a
cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the payment of fees should be accounted for in the same manner as the acquisition of other software licenses. If there is no software license, the fees should be accounted for as a service
contract. The guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either (1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially
modified after the effective date or (2) retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,

“Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Presentation and Subsequent
Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,”

which provides guidance regarding the classification of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit. Specifically, deferring and presenting debt
issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement is allowed.
We adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2015. We continued to present the debt issuance costs and related accumulated amortization relating to our lines of credit as assets.

Property Rental

—The change in property rental revenues consists primarily of an
increase of $69,622 associated with acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2014. We acquired 171 operating stores during 2015 and 51 stores during 2014. In addition, revenues increased by $47,560 as a result of increases in occupancy and rental rates to
new and existing customers at our stabilized stores. We have seen no significant increase in overall customer renewal rates and our average length of stay is approximately 13.7 months. For existing customers we generally seek to increase rental
rates approximately 7% to 10% at least annually. Rental rates to new tenants increased by approximately 8.9% over the prior year. Occupancy at our stabilized stores increased to 91.1% at December 31, 2015, as compared to 89.6% at
December 31, 2014.

Tenant Reinsurance

—The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was partially due to the increase in
overall customer participation to approximately 72.8% at December 31, 2015, compared to approximately 70.7% at December 31, 2014. In addition, we operated 1,347 stores at December 31, 2015, compared to 1,088 stores at
December 31, 2014.

Management Fees and Other Income

—Our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc.,
manages stores owned by our joint ventures and third parties. Management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash collected from stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. We also earn an asset management fee from the Storage
Portfolio I (“SPI”) joint venture, equal to 0.50% multiplied by the total asset value, provided certain conditions are met. The increase in management fees is due to an increase in the number of properties managed. At December 31,
2015, we managed 348 stores, compared to 260 stores at December 31, 2014.

Property Operations

—The increase in property operations expense consists primarily of an increase
of $26,236 related to acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2014. We acquired 171 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 51 stores during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Tenant Reinsurance

—Tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. The change is
due primarily to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed. At December 31, 2015, we owned and/or managed 1,347 stores compared to 1,088 stores at December 31, 2014. In addition, there was an increase in overall customer
participation to approximately 72.8% at December 31, 2015 from approximately 70.7% at December 31, 2014.

Acquisition Related
Costs

—These costs relate to acquisition activities during the periods indicated. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year was related primarily to the acquisition of SmartStop Self Storage Inc.
(“SmartStop”) on October 1, 2015. As part of this acquisition, we recorded an expense of $38,360 related to defeasance costs and prepayment penalties incurred related to the repayment of SmartStop’s existing debt as of the
acquisition date. We incurred $8,053 of professional fees/closing costs, $6,338 of severance-related costs, $1,327 of other payroll-related costs and $9,043 of other



acquisition related costs as a result of the acquisition of SmartStop for a total of $63,121. Additionally, we acquired 49 other properties during the year ended December 31, 2015.

General and Administrative

—General and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not related to our stores, including
corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. The expenses are recognized as incurred. General and administrative expense increased over the prior year primarily as a result of the costs related to the management of additional stores. During the
year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 171 stores, 161 of which we did not previously manage. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired 51 stores, 30 of which we did not previously manage. We did not observe any material
trends specific to payroll, travel or other expense that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores.

Depreciation and Amortization

—Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. We
acquired 171 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2015, and 51 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Gain (Loss) on Sale of Real Estate and Earnout from Prior Acquisition—

During 2011, we acquired a
store located in Florida. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired store exceeded a specified amount of net rental income for any twelve-month period prior to June 30, 2015. At the
acquisition date, $133 was recorded as the estimated amount that would be due, and we believed that it was unlikely that any significant additional payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. Because the rental growth of the stores
trended significantly higher than expected, we recorded additional liability of $2,500. This amount is included in gain (loss) on sale of real estate and earnout from prior acquisitions on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2014. The $400 gain recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 represents the adjustment needed to true up the existing liability to the amount owed to the sellers as of June 30, 2015.



During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that one of our acquisitions was
purchased at below its market value, and we therefore recorded a $1,101 gain, which represents the excess of the fair value of the store acquired over the consideration paid.

During 2012, we acquired a portfolio of ten stores. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers
if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net rental income two years after the acquisition date. At the acquisition date, we believed that it was unlikely that any significant payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision.
The rental growth of the stores was significantly higher than expected, resulting in a payment to the sellers of $7,785. This amount is included in gain (loss) on sale of real estate and earnout from prior acquisitions on our consolidated statements
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Property Casualty Loss, Net

—In October 2014, a store located in
Venice, California, was damaged by a fire. As a result, we recorded a loss, net of insurance recoveries, of $1,724.

Interest
Expense

—Interest expense increased due to the increase in total amount of debt outstanding. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate. At December 31, 2015, our total face value of debt was
$3,598,254, compared to a total face value of debt of $2,379,657 at December 31, 2014. The average interest rate was 3.1% as of December 31, 2015, compared to 3.4% as of December 31, 2014.

Non-cash

Interest Expense Related to Amortization of Discount on Equity Component of Exchangeable
Senior Notes

—Represents the amortization of the discount related to the equity component of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our Operating Partnership. In June 2013, our Operating Partnership issued $250,000 of its 2.375%
Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2033 (the “2013 Notes”). In September 2015, our Operating Partnership issued $575,000 of its 3.125% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2035 (the “2015 Notes”), and repurchased $164,636 principal amount of
the 2013 Notes. Both the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes have effective interest rates of 4.0%.

Interest Income

—Interest income
represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and interest earned on notes receivable. The increase relates primarily to the increase in the average balance of notes receivable when compared to the
prior year and an increase in our average cash balance. As part of the SmartStop acquisition on October 1, 2015, we issued an $84,331 note receivable that accrues interest at 7.0% annually. We recorded approximately $1,476 of interest income
related to this note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Interest Income on Note Receivable from Preferred
Operating Partnership Unit Holder

—Represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the holder of the Operating Partnership’s Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Units (the “Series A Units”).

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures

—Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the
income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in equity in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to increases in revenue at the stores owned by the joint ventures.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures—Gain on Sale of Real Estate Assets and Purchase of Joint Venture
Partners’ Interests

— During March 2015, one of our joint ventures sold a store located in New York to a third party and recognized a gain of $60,495. We recognized our 2.0% share of this gain, or $1,228. Additionally, in March 2015 we
acquired a joint venture partner’s 82.4% equity interest in an existing joint venture. We previously held the remaining 17.6% equity interest in this joint venture. Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our equity interest in this joint
venture as an equity-method investment. We recognized a non-cash gain of $1,629 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in this joint venture held before the acquisition.



In December 2013 and May 2014, as part of a larger acquisition, we acquired our joint venture
partners’ 60% to 65% equity interests in six stores located in California. We previously held the remaining 35% to 40% interests in these stores through six separate joint ventures with affiliates of Grupe Properties Co. Inc.
(“Grupe”). Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our interests in these joint ventures as equity-method investments. We recognized a non-cash gain of $3,438 during the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of re-measuring the
fair value of our equity interest in one of these joint ventures held before the acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an additional gain of $584 as a result of the final cash distributions received from the other
five joint ventures associated with the acquisitions that were completed during 2013.

Income Tax Expense

—The increase in
income tax expense relates primarily to an increase in income earned by our Taxable REIT Subsidiary (“TRS”) when compared to the same periods in the prior year. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded the
initial tax benefit related to a royalty fee that we charge quarterly to our captive insurance subsidiary, which reduced the tax expense for that period.

Net Income Allocated to Preferred Operating Partnership Noncontrolling Interests

—In December 2014,
as part of the acquisition of a single store, our Operating Partnership issued 548,390 Series D Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series D Units”). The Series D Units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit, and receive distributions at an
annual rate of 5.0%.

In December 2013 and May 2014, as part of a portfolio acquisition, our Operating Partnership issued 704,016
Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series C Units”). The Series C Units have a liquidation value of $42.10 per unit. From issuance until the fifth anniversary of issuance, the Series C Units receive
distributions at an annual rate of $0.18 plus the

then-payable

quarterly distribution per OP Unit.

In April 2014, as part of a single store acquisition, our Operating Partnership issued 333,360 Series B Redeemable Preferred Units
(“Series B Units”). During August and September 2013, as part of a portfolio acquisition, our Operating Partnership issued 1,342,727 Series B Units. The Series B Units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit and receive
distributions at an annual rate of 6.0%.

Income allocated to the Preferred Operating Partnership noncontrolling interests for the year
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 represents the fixed distributions paid to the holders of the Series A Units, Series B Units, Series C Units and Series D Units, plus approximately 0.7% of the remaining net income allocated to
the holders of the Series A Units.

Net Income Allocated to Operating Partnership and Other Noncontrolling Interests

—Income
allocated to the Operating Partnership represents approximately 4.2% and 3.5% of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the Preferred Operating Partnership unit holders for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. The percentage of net income allocated to the Operating Partnership noncontrolling interest increased due to OP Units issued in conjunction with acquisitions during 2015.

Property Rental

—The change in property rental revenues consists primarily of an increase of
$83,651 associated with acquisitions completed in 2014 and 2013. We acquired 51 operating stores during 2014 and 78 operating stores during 2013. In addition, revenues increased by $29,531 as a result of increases in occupancy and rental rates to
existing customers at our stabilized stores. We have seen no significant increase in overall customer renewal rates and our average length of stay is approximately 12.9 months. For existing customers we generally seek to increase rental rates
approximately 7% to 10% at least annually. Occupancy at our stabilized stores increased to 91.0% at December 31, 2014, as compared to 88.4% at December 31, 2013. Rental rates to new tenants increased by approximately 3.9% over the same
period in the prior year.

Tenant Reinsurance

—The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was partially due to the increase in
overall customer participation to approximately 70.7% at December 31, 2014, compared to approximately 68.7% at December 31, 2013. In addition, we operated 1,088 stores at December 31, 2014, compared to 1,029 stores at
December 31, 2013.

Management Fees and Other Income

—Our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc.,
manages stores owned by our joint ventures and third parties. Management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash collected from stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. We also earn an asset management fee from the Storage
Portfolio I (“SPI”) joint venture, equal to 0.50% multiplied by the total asset value, provided certain conditions are met. The increase in management fees is due to increased revenues at the managed stores.

Property Operations

—The increase in property operations expense consists primarily of
an increase of $30,036 related to acquisitions completed in 2014 and 2013. We acquired 51 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 78 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Tenant Reinsurance

—Tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. The change is
due primarily to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed. At December 31, 2014, we owned and/or managed 1,088 stores compared to 1,029 stores at December 31, 2013. In addition, there was an increase in overall customer
participation to approximately 70.7% at December 31, 2014 from approximately 68.7% at December 31, 2013.

Acquisition Related
Costs

—These costs relate to acquisition activities during the periods indicated. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the prior year was related primarily to the expense of $3,550 of defeasance costs paid
in an acquisition in December 2014. This increase was offset by a decrease in the number of stores acquired. We acquired 51 operating stores during 2014, compared to 78 operating stores acquired during 2013.

General and Administrative

—General and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not related to our stores, including
corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. The expenses are recognized as incurred. General and administrative expense increased over the prior year primarily as a result of the costs related to the management of additional stores. During the
year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired 52 stores, 30 of which we did not previously manage. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we acquired 78 stores, 47 of which we did not previously manage. We did not observe any material trends
specific to payroll, travel or other expense that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores.

Depreciation and Amortization

—Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. We
acquired 51 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2014, and 78 stores during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Gain (Loss) on Sale of Real Estate and Earnout from Prior Acquisitions

—During 2011,
we acquired a store located in Florida. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired store exceeded a specified amount of net rental income for any twelve-month period prior to
June 30, 2015. At the acquisition date, $133 was recorded as the estimated amount that would be due, and we believed that it was unlikely that any significant additional payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. Because the
rental growth of the store was trending significantly higher than expected, we estimated that an additional earnout payment of $2,500 would be due to the seller. This amount is included in gain (loss) on sale of real estate and earnout from prior
acquisitions on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

During 2012, we acquired a portfolio
of ten stores. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net rental income two years after the acquisition date. At the acquisition date, we
believed that it was unlikely that any significant payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. The rental growth of the stores was significantly higher than expected, resulting in a payment to the sellers of $7,785. This amount is
included in gain (loss) on sale of real estate and earnout from prior acquisitions on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The gain on sale of real estate assets recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 was related to two transactions: (1) we
recorded a gain of $800 as a result of the condemnation of a portion of land in California that resulted from eminent domain, and (2) we recorded a gain of $160 as a result of the sale of one store in Florida for $3,250 in cash.

Property Casualty Loss, Net

—In October 2014, a store located in Venice, California, was damaged by a fire. As a result, we
recorded a loss, net of insurance recoveries, of $1,724.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt Related to Portfolio Acquisition

—The
loss on extinguishment of debt occurred as part of a loan assumption and immediate defeasance upon closing of a portfolio acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Interest Expense

—Interest expense increased due to the increase in total amount of debt outstanding. This increase was partially
offset by a decrease in the average interest rate. At December 31, 2014, our total face value of debt was $2,379,657 compared to total face value of debt of $1,958,586 at December 31, 2013. The average interest rate was 3.4% as of
December 31, 2014, compared to 3.8% as of December 31, 2013.

Non-cash

Interest
Expense Related to Amortization of Discount on Equity Component of Exchangeable Senior Notes

—Represents the amortization of the discount related to the equity component of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our Operating Partnership,
which reflects the 4.0% effective interest rate relative to the carrying amount of the liability. In June 2013, our Operating Partnership issued $250,000 of its 2013 Notes.

Interest Income

—Interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and
interest earned on notes receivable. The increase relates primarily to the increase in the average balance of notes receivable when compared to the prior year.

Interest Income on Note Receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership Unit Holder

—Represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the
holder of the Operating Partnership’s Series A Units.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate
Ventures

—Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. The decrease was due to the acquisition of our joint venture partners’
interests in several joint ventures during 2013. There were 252 operating stores owned by unconsolidated real estate ventures as of December 31, 2014, compared to 254 stores as of December 31, 2013, and 280 as of December 31, 2012.



Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures—Gain on Sale of Real Estate
Assets and Purchase of Joint Venture Partners’ Interests

—In December 2013 and May 2014, as part of a larger acquisition, we acquired our joint venture partners’ 60% to 65% equity interests in six stores located in California. We
previously held the remaining 35% to 40% interests in these stores through six separate joint ventures with affiliates of Grupe. Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our interests in these joint ventures as equity-method investments. We
recognized a non-cash gain of $3,438 during the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in one of these joint ventures held before the acquisition. During the year ended December 31,
2014, we recorded an additional gain of $584 as a result of the final cash distributions received from the other five joint ventures associated with the acquisitions that were completed during 2013. We recognized non-cash gains of $9,339 during the
year ended December 31, 2013, which represented the increase in the fair values of our prior interests in the Grupe joint ventures from their formations to the acquisition dates.

On November 1, 2013, we acquired an additional 49% equity interest from our joint venture partners, which retained a 1% interest in the

HSRE-ESP

IA, LLC joint venture (“HSRE”) that owns 19 stores. This transaction resulted in a

non-cash

gain of $34,136, which represents the increase in the fair
value of our 50% interest in HSRE from the formation of the joint venture to the acquisition date.

In February 2013, we acquired our
partners’ equity interests in two joint ventures that each held one store. As a result of the acquisitions, we recognized

non-cash

gains of $2,556, which represents the increase in the fair values of our
prior interests in the joint ventures from their formations to the acquisition dates.

Income Tax Expense

— The decrease in
income tax expense relates primarily to a royalty charged to the insurance captive by the Operating Partnership for access to and use of customer lists and intellectual property. The effect of this change lowered the taxable income of the TRS.

Net Income Allocated to Preferred Operating Partnership Noncontrolling Interests

—In December 2014,
as part of the acquisition of a single store, our Operating Partnership issued 548,390 Series D Units. The Series D Units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit, and receive distributions at an annual rate of 5.0%.

In December 2013 and May 2014, as part of a portfolio acquisition, our Operating Partnership issued 704,016 Series C Convertible
Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series C Units”). The Series C Units have a liquidation value of $42.10 per unit. From issuance until the fifth anniversary of issuance, the Series C Units receive distributions at an annual rate
of $0.18 plus the

then-payable

quarterly distribution per common OP Unit.

In April 2014, as part
of a single store acquisition, our Operating Partnership issued 333,360 Series B Units. During August and September 2013, as part of a portfolio acquisition, our Operating Partnership issued 1,342,727 Series B Units. The Series B Units
have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit and receive distributions at an annual rate of 6.0%.



Income allocated to the Preferred Operating Partnership noncontrolling interests for the year
ended December 31, 2014 represents the fixed distributions paid to the holders of the Series A Units, Series B Units, Series C Units and Series D Units, plus approximately 0.7% of the remaining net income allocated to the holders
of the Series A Units.

Net Income Allocated to Operating Partnership and Other Noncontrolling Interests

—Income allocated to
the Operating Partnership represents approximately 3.5% and 3.6% of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the Preferred Operating Partnership unit holders for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

FFO provides
relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. We believe FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings.
Net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe FFO more
accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (“NAREIT”) as net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment

write-downs

of depreciable real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to
record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the
consolidated financial statements.

The computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies
that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should
not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions.

wholly-owned

at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented that had achieved stabilization as of the first day of



such period. The following tables present operating data for our

same-store

portfolio. We consider the following

discounts. Expenses were higher for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to increases in tenant reinsurance expense, credit card merchant fees and property taxes. Increases were offset by decreases in utility expenses and property insurance
expense.

The increases in

same-store

rental and tenant reinsurance
revenues for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the same periods ended December 31, 2013, were due primarily to an increase in occupancy, a decrease in discounts to new customers, and an average increase of
4.0% to 5.0% in incoming rates to new tenants. Expenses were higher for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to increases in office expense, property taxes and repairs and maintenance. These expenses were partially offset by a decrease in
property insurance in the three months and year ended December 31, 2014.

CASH FLOWS

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014

Cash provided by operating activities was $367,329 and $337,581 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change
when compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $13,640 increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $18,381. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the change in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities of $4,812.

Cash used in investing activities was $1,625,664 and $564,948 for the years ended December 31, 2015
and 2014, respectively. The change was primarily the result of an increase of $1,200,853 paid for the acquisition of SmartStop in October 2015. There was also an increase of $55,073 in cash used to purchase/issue notes receivable. These increases in
cash outflows were partially offset by an increase of $45,080 in cash received as returns of investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures.

Cash provided by financing activities was $1,286,471 and $148,307 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net
increase was due to a number of factors, including an increase of $1,204,138 in the cash proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable and lines of credit, an increase of $446,877 in the cash proceeds received from the sale of common stock,
and an increase of $563,500 in the net proceeds from the issuance of exchangeable senior notes. These increases in cash inflows were offset by an increase of $780,442 of cash paid for principal payments on notes payable and lines of credit, an
increase of $227,212 in cash paid to repurchase existing exchangeable senior notes, and an increase of $59,211 in cash paid as dividends on our common stock.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2014 to the Year Ended December 31, 2013

Cash provided by operating activities was $337,581 and $271,259 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change
when compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease of $42,594 in non-cash gains related to purchases of joint venture partners’ interests. There was also a $10,340 increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and
amortization of $19,844. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the loss on extinguishment of debt related to portfolio acquisition of $9,153.

Cash used in investing activities was $564,948 and $366,976 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change was
primarily the result of an increase of $153,579 in the amount of cash used to acquire new stores in 2014 when compared to 2013. There was also an increase of $24,258 in cash used to purchase/issue notes receivable, and an increase of $17,062 in cash
used in the development and redevelopment of real estate assets.

Cash provided by financing activities was $148,307 and $191,655 for the
years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The net decrease was due to a number of factors, including a decrease of $205,988 in the cash proceeds received from the sale of common stock, a decrease of $246,250 in the proceeds from
issuance of exchangeable senior notes, and an increase of $47,077 in cash paid as dividends on common stock. These decreases were offset by an increase of $335,479 in the proceeds from notes payable and lines of credit, and a decrease of $131,244 in
principal payments on notes payable and lines of credit.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2015, we had $75,799 available in cash and cash equivalents. We intend to use this cash for acquisitions, to repay debt
scheduled to mature in 2015 and for general corporate purposes. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a REIT.

Our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our
operating accounts. During 2015, we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents; however, there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial
markets.

The following table presents information on our lines of credit for the period presented. All of our lines of credit are

As of December 31, 2015, we had $3,598,254 face value
of debt, resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 23.2%. As of December 31, 2015, the ratio of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 68.6% (including $1,527,386 on which we have interest rate swaps that have
been included as

fixed-rate

debt). The weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at December 31, 2015 was 3.1%. Certain of our real estate assets are pledged as
collateral for our debt. We are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt. We were in compliance with all financial covenants at December 31, 2015.

We expect to fund our

short-term

liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring
capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of OP Units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Lines. In addition, we are pursuing
additional term loans secured by unencumbered stores.

Our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders, store
acquisitions, principal payments under our borrowings and

non-recurring

capital expenditures. We may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt, shares of common stock or other securities in
open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In addition, we evaluate, on an
ongoing basis, the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships, which may require us to raise additional funds. We do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such
needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness, joint ventures with third parties, and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt. Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or
at all. Any additional issuance of equity or

equity-linked

securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and



privileges senior to holders of our common stock. We may also use OP Units as currency to fund acquisitions from

self-storage

owners who desire

tax-deferral

in their exiting transactions.

OFF-BALANCE

SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities
or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating

off-balance

sheet arrangements
or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding
to any such entities. Accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.

The operating leases above include minimum future lease payments on leases for 19 of our operating stores as
well as leases of our corporate offices. Two ground leases include additional contingent rental payments based on the level of revenue achieved at the store.

As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 3.6%, and the weighted average interest rate on
all variable rate loans was 2.1%.

FINANCING STRATEGY

We will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors. Although our
board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness
that will be either fixed or variable rate. In making financing decisions, we will consider factors including but not limited to:

•

the interest rate of the proposed financing;

•

the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our stores;

•

prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing;

•

the purchase price of stores acquired with debt financing;

•

long-term

objectives with respect to the financing;

•

target investment returns;

•

the ability of particular stores, and our Company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments;



•

overall level of consolidated indebtedness;

•

timing of debt and lease maturities;

•

provisions that require recourse and

cross-collateralization;

•

corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets; and

•

the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt.

Our indebtedness may be recourse,

non-recourse

or

cross-collateralized.

If the indebtedness is

non-recourse,

the collateral will be limited to the particular stores to
which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our stores, or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis. We may use the proceeds from any
borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing stores, for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we
believe it is advisable.

We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt, as well as shares of common stock or
other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts
involved may be material.

SEASONALITY

The

self-storage

business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and
profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter may not be indicative
of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

Item 7a.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future income, cash flows and fair values
of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic
and political considerations and other factors beyond our control.

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.6 billion in
total face value debt, of which approximately $1.1 billion was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on
the variable rate debt (excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors) would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7.3 million annually.

Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These
analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty
of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Extra Space Storage Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Extra Space Storage Inc. (“the Company”) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the index at Item 8. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
the Company at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its reporting of debt issuance costs as a result of the adoption of
the amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification resulting from Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, “Interest – Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Extra Space Storage Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework”) and
our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Extra Space Storage Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2015

(amounts in thousands, except store and share data)

1.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Extra Space Storage Inc. (the “Company”) is a fully integrated, self-administered and

self-managed

real estate investment trust (“REIT”), formed as a Maryland Corporation on April 30, 2004, to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage
properties located throughout the United States. The Company continues the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries, which had engaged in the

self-storage

business since 1977. The
Company’s interest in its stores is held through its operating partnership, Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating Partnership”), which was formed on May 5, 2004. The Company’s primary assets are general partner and
limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Internal Revenue Code”). To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be subject to tax, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.

The Company invests in stores by acquiring

wholly-owned

stores or by acquiring an equity interest in
real estate entities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had direct and indirect equity interests in 999 storage facilities. In addition, the Company managed 348 stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which it owns and/or
manages to 1,347. These stores are located in 36 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.

The Company operates in three distinct
segments: (1) rental operations; (2) tenant reinsurance; and (3) property management, acquisition and development. The rental operations activities include rental operations of stores in which we have an ownership interest. No single
tenant accounts for more than 5.0% of rental income. Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in the Company’s stores. The Company’s property management, acquisition and
development activities include managing, acquiring, developing and selling stores.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly- or majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Variable Interest Entities

The Company
accounts for arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights as variable interest entities (“VIEs”). An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is created when
(i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity’s equity holders as a group either:
(a) lack the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they
occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an entity is deemed to be a VIE, the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest, or combination of variable interests, that
provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the VIE, is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.



The Company has concluded that under certain circumstances when the Company enters into
arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (i), (ii) (b) or (c) of the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, the Company has performed a qualitative analysis, including considering
which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each VIE and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be
significant to the VIE. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with the Company’s financial statements. Additionally, the Operating Partnership
has notes payable to three trusts that are VIEs under condition (ii)(a) above. Since the Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts, these VIEs are not consolidated.

The Company’s investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control, and joint ventures
which are VIEs in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value
Disclosures

Derivative financial instruments

Currently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely
accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based
inputs, including interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable
cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate forward curves.

The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective
counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit
enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. In conjunction with the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s fair value measurement guidance, the Company made an accounting policy election to measure the
credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value
hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of
December 31, 2015, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to
the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.



The table below presents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis as of December 31, 2015, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall.

There were no transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year ended
December 31, 2015. The Company did not have any significant assets or liabilities that are

re-measured

on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs as of December 31, 2015 or 2014.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Long-lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. The Company reviews
each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. The Company focuses on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. For these stores, the Company determines
whether the decrease is temporary or permanent, and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. In addition, the Company reviews stores in the lease-up stage and compares actual operating results to
original projections.

When the Company determines that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred, the Company compares the
carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash
flows attributable to the assets. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets.

When real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair
value of the assets, net of selling costs. If the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, the Company would recognize a loss on the
disposal group classified as held for sale. The operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had seven stores
classified as held for sale. The estimated fair value less selling costs of each of these assets is greater than the carrying value of the assets, and therefore no loss has been recorded.

The Company assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures
may be impaired annually and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. An investment is impaired if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment
has occurred, and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.



Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, other financial instruments included in other assets, accounts
payable and accrued expenses,

variable-rate

notes payable, lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximate fair value.

The fair values of the Company’s notes receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership unit holders and other fixed rate notes receivable
was based on the discounted estimated future cash flow of the notes (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the discount rate used approximated the current market rate for loans with similar maturities and credit quality. The
fair values of the Company’s fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts were estimated using the discounted estimated future cash payments to be made on such debt (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the
discount rates used approximated current market rates for loans, or groups of loans, with similar maturities and credit quality. The fair value of the Company’s exchangeable senior notes was estimated using an average market price for similar
securities obtained from a third party.

The fair values of the Company’s fixed-rate assets and liabilities were as follows for the

Real Estate Assets

Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development,
construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized. The construction period begins when
expenditures for the real estate assets have been made and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use are in progress. The construction period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend
the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the

straight-line

method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and
improvements, which are generally between five and 39 years.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of stores, the
purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, is
determined as if vacant. Intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases. The Company measures the value of tenant relationships
based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers, which is based on the Company’s historical experience with turnover in its stores. Debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based
on current interest rates compared to contractual rates. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.



Intangible lease rights represent: (1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three
stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are amortized to expense over the life of the leases and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on six stores where the leases were assumed by the Company at rates
that were lower than the current market rates for similar leases. The values associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the lease terms.

Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures

The Company’s investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control and joint ventures
which are VIEs in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Under the equity method, the Company’s investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for the Company’s share of
net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on the Company’s ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the
purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows, the Company follows the “look through” approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow
unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture’s sale of assets), in which case it is
reported as an investing activity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States and at times may exceed federally insured
limits. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash is comprised of letters of credit and escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions located throughout the
United States relating to earnest money deposits on potential acquisitions, real estate taxes, insurance and capital expenditures.

Other Assets

Other assets consist primarily of equipment and fixtures, customer accounts receivable, investments in trusts, notes receivable, other
intangible assets, income taxes receivable, deferred tax assets, prepaid expenses and the fair value of interest rate swaps. Depreciation of equipment and fixtures is computed on a straight-line basis over three to five years.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on
the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives
designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain
or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged



forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not
apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.

The Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of
its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Risk Management and Use
of Financial Instruments

In the normal course of its ongoing business operations, the Company encounters economic risk. There are
three main components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its interest-bearing liabilities. Credit risk is the risk of inability or unwillingness of tenants to make
contractually required payments. Market risk is the risk of declines in the value of stores due to changes in rental rates, interest rates or other market factors affecting the value of stores held by the Company. The Company has entered into
interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its interest rate risk.

Exchange of Common Operating Partnership Units

Redemption of common Operating Partnership units for shares of common stock, when redeemed under the original provisions of the Operating
Partnership agreement, are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to the Company’s equity.

Revenue and Expense Recognition

Rental
revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally on month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are
recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period. Late charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized as income when earned. Management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are
performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate
entities. Interest income is recognized as earned.

Property expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and
other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. The Company accrues for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts, estimates and historical trends. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be
affected.

Tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage. The Company records an unpaid
claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history. The unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end, including
both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported. The Company uses a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received. The administrator evaluates each claim to
determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported. Annually, a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid claims liability. Prior year claim reserves are adjusted as
experience develops or new information becomes known. The impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations. The unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value. Each tenant chooses the amount of insurance
coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program. Tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee. As of December 31, 2015, the average
insurance coverage for tenants was approximately two thousand six hundred dollars. The Company’s exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each



tenant. The Company purchases reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount for any one event. The Company does not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements.

Real Estate Sales

In general, sales of
real estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition;
other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition.

Advertising Costs

The Company incurs advertising costs primarily attributable to internet, directory and other advertising. These costs are expensed as incurred.
The Company recognized $8,539, $8,370, and $6,482 in advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to
be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, among other things, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its
stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its income and assets. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to
stockholders. The Company plans to continue to operate so that it meets the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If the Company were to fail to meet these requirements, it would
be subject to federal income tax. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended
December 31, 2015, 0.0% (unaudited) of all distributions to stockholders qualified as a return of capital.

The Company has elected
to treat its corporate subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc. (“ESMI”), as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). In general, the Company’s TRS may perform additional services for tenants and may engage in any real estate
or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax. ESM Reinsurance Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ESMI, generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to corporate federal income tax and state
insurance premiums tax.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases
of assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no material unrecognized tax benefits. Interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred. As of
December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax provisions.

Stock-Based Compensation

The measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors are based on estimated
fair values. Awards granted are valued at fair value and any compensation element is recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings
per common share is computed using the two-class method by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. All outstanding unvested restricted stock awards
contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends and participate in undistributed earnings with common stockholders; accordingly, they are considered participating



securities that are included in the two-class method. Diluted earnings per common share measures the performance of the Company over the reporting period while giving effect to all potential
common shares that were dilutive and outstanding during the period. The denominator includes the weighted average number of basic shares and the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares that
were dilutive had been issued, and is calculated using either the two-class, treasury stock or as if-converted method, whichever is most dilutive. Potential common shares are securities (such as options, convertible debt, Series A Participating
Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series A Units”), Series B Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series B Units”), Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series C Units”), Series D Redeemable Preferred Units
(“Series D Units”) and common Operating Partnership units (“OP Units”)) that do not have a current right to participate in earnings of the Company but could do so in the future by virtue of their option, redemption or conversion
right.

In computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, net income is adjusted to add back any changes in earnings in the
period associated with the convertible security. The numerator also is adjusted for the effects of any other non-discretionary changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares. In computing
diluted earnings per common share, only potential common shares that are dilutive (those that reduce earnings per common share) are included. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, options to purchase approximately 62,254,
27,374, and 44,958 shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the computation of earnings per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

The following table presents the number of Preferred Operating Partnership units, and the potential common shares, that were excluded from the
computation of earnings per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive:

The Operating Partnership had $85,364 of its 2.375% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2033 (the “2013
Notes”) issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The 2013 Notes could potentially have a dilutive impact on the Company’s earnings per share calculations. The 2013 Notes are exchangeable by holders into shares of the Company’s
common stock under certain circumstances per the terms of the indenture governing the 2013 Notes. The exchange price of the 2013 Notes was $54.99 per share as of December 31, 2015, and could change over time as described in the indenture. The
Company has irrevocably agreed to pay only cash for the accreted principal amount of the 2013 Notes relative to its exchange obligations, but retained the right to satisfy the exchange obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount in cash
and/or common stock.

The Operating Partnership had $575,000 of its 3.125% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2035 (the “2015 Notes”)
issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The 2015 Notes could potentially have a dilutive impact on the Company’s earnings per share calculations. The 2015 Notes are exchangeable by holders into shares of the Company’s common stock
under certain circumstances per the terms of the indenture governing the 2015 Notes. The exchange price of the 2015 Notes was $95.40 per share as of December 31, 2015, and could change over time as described in the indenture. The Company has
irrevocably agreed to pay only cash for the accreted principal amount of the 2015 Notes relative to its exchange obligations, but retained the right to satisfy the exchange obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount in cash and/or common
stock.



Though the Company has retained that right, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
260,

“Earnings per Share,”

requires an assumption that shares would be used to pay the exchange obligation in excess of the accreted principal amount, and requires that those shares be included in the Company’s calculation of
weighted average common shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share computation. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, 513,040 shares, 130,883 shares, and no shares, respectively, related to the 2013 Notes were included in
the computation for diluted earnings per share. For the year ended December 31, 2015, no shares related to the 2015 Notes were included in the computation for diluted earnings per share as the exchange price exceeded the per share price of the
Company’s common stock during this period. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, no shares related to the 2015 Notes were included in the computation for diluted earnings per share as the 2015 Notes were not outstanding.

For the purposes of computing the diluted impact on earnings per share of the potential exchange of Series A Units for common shares upon
redemption, where the Company has the option to redeem in cash or shares and where the Company has stated the positive intent and ability to settle at least $115,000 of the instrument in cash (or net settle a portion of the Series A Units
against the related outstanding note receivable), only the amount of the instrument in excess of $115,000 is considered in the calculation of shares contingently issuable for the purposes of computing diluted earnings per share as allowed by ASC
260-10-45-46.

For the purposes of computing the diluted impact on earnings per share of the potential exchange of Series B Units for
common shares upon redemption, where the Company has the option to redeem in cash or shares and where the Company has stated the intent and ability to settle the redemption in shares, the Company divided the total value of the Series B Units
outstanding as of December 31, 2015 of $41,902 by the closing price of the Company’s common stock as of December 31, 2015 of $88.21 per share. Assuming full exchange for common shares as of December 31, 2015, 475,027 shares would
have been issued to the holders of the Series B Units.

For the purposes of computing the diluted impact on earnings per share of the
potential exchange of Series C Units into common shares upon redemption, where the Company has the option to redeem in cash or shares and where the Company has stated the intent and ability to settle the redemption in shares, the Company
divided the total value of the Series C Units outstanding as of December 31, 2015 of $29,639 by the closing price of the Company’s common stock as of December 31, 2015 of $88.21 per share. Assuming full exchange for common shares
as of December 31, 2015, 336,006 shares would have been issued to the holders of the Series C Units.

For the purposes of
computing the diluted impact on earnings per share of the potential exchange of Series D Units into common shares upon redemption, where the Company has the option to redeem in cash or shares and where the Company has stated the intent and ability
to settle the redemption in shares, the Company divided the total value of the Series D Units outstanding as of December 31, 2015 of $13,710 by the closing price of the Company’s common stock as of December 31, 2015 of $88.21 per share.
Assuming full exchange for common shares as of December 31, 2015, 155,422 shares would have been issued to the holders of Series D Units.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-08,
“

Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.

” Under this guidance, only disposals
representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. The guidance also requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued
operation. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2015. The Company has not previously had discontinued operations and as such, this guidance did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “

Revenue from Contracts with Customers,

” which amends the guidance for revenue
recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 outlines a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition
that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. ASU
2014-09 was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In July 2015, the FASB approved
a one-year deferral of the effective date of the standard. The new standard will now become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. The Company has not
yet selected a transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, “

Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to
the Consolidation Analysis.”

This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. ASU 2015-02 amends the criteria for determining if a service
provider possesses a variable interest in a variable interest entity (“VIE”), and eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to
materially impact its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “

Interest—Imputation of
Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,

” which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new
guidance only impacts financial statement presentation. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2016 and allows for early adoption. The Company adopted this guidance October 1, 2015. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on a retrospective
basis. As a result $20,120 of unamortized debt issuance costs that had been included in the Other assets line on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 are now presented as direct deductions from the carrying amounts of the related
debt liabilities.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, “

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software
(Subtopic 350-40)—Customers Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement,

” which provides guidance regarding the accounting for fees paid by a customer in cloud computing arrangements. If a cloud computing arrangement
includes a software license, the payment of fees should be accounted for in the same manner as the acquisition of other software licenses. If there is no software license, the fees should be accounted for as a service contract. The guidance is
effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. An entity can elect to adopt the amendments either (1) prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or (2)
retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,

“Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Presentation and Subsequent
Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,”

which provides guidance regarding the classification of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit. Specifically, deferring and presenting debt
issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement is
allowed. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2015. The Company continued to present the debt issuance costs and related accumulated amortization relating to its lines of credit as assets.

The real estate assets held for sale consist of a portfolio of six stores located in Ohio and
Indiana, a single store located in Indiana, and a portion of land at an operating store in New Jersey. The estimated fair value less selling costs of each of these assets is greater than the carrying value of the assets, and therefore no loss has
been recorded. The six-store portfolio is under contract, and the sale is expected to close by the second quarter of 2016. The single store located in Indiana is currently listed for sale but is not yet under contract. The Company expects that this
property will be sold by the end of 2016. The land in New Jersey is also under contract and the sale is expected to close by the end of 2016. These assets held for sale are included in the rental operations segment of the Company’s segment
information.

The Company amortizes to expense intangible assets—tenant relationships on a

straight-line

basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility (currently estimated at 18 months). The Company amortizes to expense the intangible lease rights over the
terms of the related leases. Amortization related to the tenant relationships and lease rights was $11,695, $12,996, and $12,065 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The remaining balance of the unamortized lease
rights will be amortized over the next 3 to 46 years.

(1)

This column represents costs paid at closing. The amounts shown exclude other acquisition costs paid before or after the closing date.

(2)

This represents the acquisition of SmartStop Self Storage, Inc. (“SmartStop”). See below for more detailed information about this acquisition.

(3)

The Company determined the consideration paid for this store was below its market value, and recognized a $1,100 gain, representing the difference between the fair value of the store and the consideration paid.

(4)

This represents the acquisition of a joint venture partners’ interest in Extra Space of Sacramento One LLC (“Sacramento One”), an existing joint venture, for $1,700 in cash. The result of the
acquisition is that the Company owns 100% of Sacramento One, which owned one store located in California. Prior to the acquisition date, the Company accounted for its interest in Sacramento One as an equity-method investment, and the Company
also held mortgage notes receivable from Sacramento One totalling $11,009, including related interest. The total acquisition date fair value of the Company’s previous equity interest was approximately $365 and is included in consideration
transfered. The Company recognized a non-cash gain of $1,629 as a result of remeasuring the fair value of its equity interest held prior to the acquisition. The store is consolidated subsequent to the acquisition as the Company owns 100% of the
store.

(5)

Included in net liabilities/(assets) assumed is a $5,400 liability related to an earnout provision.

(6)

This represents the acquisition of a non-operating property that the Company plans to convert to a self-storage store.

(7)

Included in closing costs is approximately $3,271 of defeasance costs.

(8)

The Company previously held no equity interest in two of the three properties acquired. The Company acquired its joint venture partner’s 60% interest in an existing joint venture which held one property in
California, resulting in full ownership by the Company. Prior to the acquisition date, the Company accounted for its 40% interest in this joint venture as an equity method investment. The total acquisition date fair value of the previous
equity interest was approximately $3,567 and is included as consideration transferred. The Company recognized a non-cash gain of $3,438 as a result of remeasuring its prior equity interest in this joint venture held before the
acquisition. The three properties were acquired in exchange for approximately $2,726 of cash and 226,285 Series C Units valued at $10,451.

(9)

This property was owned by Spencer F. Kirk, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and Kenneth M. Woolley, the Company’s Executive Chairman. The Company acquired the building on March 4, 2014. In a
separate transaction on March 5, 2014, the Company acquired the land for $2,150 from a third party unrelated to the Company’s executives and terminated the existing ground lease.



Acquisition of SmartStop

On October 1, 2015, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of SmartStop, a public non-traded REIT (the
“Transaction”), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 15, 2015 (the “Merger Agreement”). The Company completed the Transaction as part of its strategy to acquire stores and portfolios of stores that can increase
stockholder value. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, SmartStop shareholders received $13.75 per share in cash, which represented a total purchase price of approximately $1,391,272.

In connection with the Transaction, it was agreed that certain assets would be excluded from the Company’s acquisition of SmartStop (the
“Excluded Assets”). The Company had determined that the Excluded Assets were not complementary to the Company’s business or otherwise not of primary interest to the Company. These Excluded Assets were instead sold by SmartStop to
Strategic 1031, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Strategic 1031”), prior to the Transaction. The Excluded Assets included five SmartStop stores located in Canada, one parcel of land located in California that is under
development, and SmartStop’s non-traded REIT platform. Strategic 1031 is owned by and controlled by SmartStop’s former Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors.

The following table reconciles the purchase price to cash paid by the Company and total consideration transferred to acquire SmartStop:

As part of this acquisition, we recorded an expense of $38,360 related to defeasance costs and prepayment
penalties incurred related to the repayment of SmartStop’s existing debt as of the acquisition date. We incurred $8,053 of professional fees/closing costs, $6,338 of severance-related costs, and $1,327 of other payroll-related costs for a total
of $54,078 that was paid at closing. Another $9,043 of other acquisition related costs were incurred that were not paid in connection with the closing for a total of $63,121.



The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date. The company is in the process of finalizing a third party valuation. As such the allocation of fair value between land, buildings and intangibles is subject to change. The Company’s allocation of consideration
transferred for SmartStop is as follows:

The Company agreed to loan Strategic 1031 $84,331 to finance the purchase of the Excluded Assets. The loans
are secured by an interest in the Excluded Assets and accrue interest at 7.0% per annum. The loans have a term of 365 days after the closing of the Transaction, due on September 30, 2016. These loans receivable are included in Other assets on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Pro Forma Information

As noted above, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired 171 operating stores, including the 122 stores acquired in
conjunction with the acquisition of SmartStop. The following pro forma financial information includes 137 of the 171 operating stores acquired. 34 stores were excluded as it was impractical to obtain the historical information from the previous
owners and in total they represent and immaterial amount of total revenues. The following pro forma financial information is based on the combined historical financial statements of the Company and 137 of the stores acquired, and presents the
Company’s results as if the acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2014 (unaudited):

The Total revenues for SmartStop in the table above represent the revenues of SmartStop for the period prior

expenses related to the Excluded Assets), plus estimated additional depreciation, amortization, interest expenses and the elimination of non-recurring acquisition costs recorded by SmartStop and the Company.

The unaudited pro forma results do not reflect any operating efficiency or potential cost savings which may result from the acquisition of
SmartStop. Accordingly, these unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operation of the combined company would have been if the acquisition had
occurred at the beginning of the period presented nor are they indicative of future results of operations and are not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisition been
consummated as of January 1, 2014.

Other Acquisitions and Disposals

On December 11, 2013, the Company sold 50% of its ownership in a parcel of undeveloped land held for sale located in California for
$2,025. The buyer holds their 50% interest as a tenant in common. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of the sale. As the Company’s interest is now held as a tenant in common, the value of the land was reclassified from land to investment
in unconsolidated real estate ventures on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

On December 6, 2013, the Company sold a
store located in Florida for $3,250 in cash. As a result of this transaction, a gain of $160 was recorded.

In June 2013, the Company
recorded a gain of $800 due to the condemnation of a portion of land at one store in California that resulted from eminent domain.

On
May 16, 2013, the Company sold a store located in New York for $950. No gain or loss was recorded as a result of the sale.

Losses on Earnouts
from Prior Acquisitions

During 2012, the Company acquired a portfolio of ten stores located in New Jersey and New York. As part of
this acquisition, the Company agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net rental income two years after the acquisition date. At the acquisition date, the Company believed that
it was unlikely that any significant payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. The rental growth of the stores was significantly higher than expected, resulting in a payment to the sellers of $7,785. This amount is included in
gain (loss) on real estate transactions and earnout from prior acquisitions on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

During 2011, the Company acquired a store located in Florida. As part of this acquisition, the Company agreed to make an additional cash
payment to the sellers if the acquired store exceeded a specified amount of net rental income for any twelve-month period prior to June 30, 2015. At the acquisition date, $133 was recorded as the estimated amount that would be due, and the Company
believed that it was unlikely that any significant additional payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. Because the rental growth of the stores was trending significantly higher than expected, the Company estimated that an
additional earnout payment of $2,500 would be due to the seller as of December 31, 2014. This amount is included in gain (loss) on real estate transactions and earnout from prior acquisitions on the Company’s consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a gain of $400 to adjust the existing liability to the actual amount owed to the sellers as of June 30, 2015. This gain is included in
gain (loss) on real estate transactions and earnout from prior acquisitions on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.

In these joint ventures, the Company and the joint venture partner generally receive a preferred return on
their invested capital. To the extent that cash/profits in excess of these preferred returns are generated through operations or capital transactions, the Company would receive a higher percentage of the excess cash/profits than its equity interest.

In accordance with ASC 810, the Company reviews all of its joint venture relationships quarterly to ensure that there are no entities
that require consolidation. As of December 31, 2015, there were no previously unconsolidated entities that were required to be consolidated as a result of this review.

On December 30, 2015, the Company entered into a new joint venture, ESS-H Bloomfield Investment LLC (“Bloomfield”). Bloomfield owns
a single store in New Jersey. The Company contributed $2,885 for a 50% interest in Bloomfield. The Company’s investment in Bloomfield is included in Other minority owned properties in the table above.

In December 2013 and May 2014, the Company acquired twelve stores located in California from entities associated with Grupe Properties Co.
Inc. (“Grupe.”) As part of the Grupe acquisition, the Company acquired its joint venture partners’ 60% to 65% equity interests in six stores. The Company previously held the remaining 35% to 40% interests in these stores through six
separate joint ventures with Grupe. Prior to the acquisition, the Company accounted for its interests in these joint ventures as equity-method investments. The Company recognized a non-cash gain of $3,438 during the year ended December 31, 2014 as a
result of re-measuring the fair value of its equity interest in one of these joint ventures held before the acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded a gain of $584 as a result of the final cash distributions
received from the other five joint ventures associated with the acquisitions that were completed during 2013. The Company recognized non-cash gains of $9,339 during the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of

re-measuring

its prior equity interests in five joint ventures held before the acquisition.

On
November 1, 2013, the Company acquired its joint venture partner’s 49% interest in

HSRE-ESP

IA, LLC (“HSRE”), an existing joint venture, for $43,475 in cash and the assumption of a
$96,516 loan. The



result of this acquisition is that the Company owns a 99% interest in HSRE. The joint venture partner retained a 1% interest, valued at $870, which was recorded at fair value based on the fair
value of the assets in the joint venture and is included in other noncontrolling interests on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. HSRE

owns 19
stores in various states. The stores are now consolidated as the Company owns the majority interest in the joint venture. Prior to the acquisition date, the Company accounted for its 50% interest in the joint venture as an equity-method investment.
The acquisition date fair value of the previous equity interest was approximately $43,500, and is included as consideration transferred. The Company recognized a non-cash gain of $34,137 during the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of

re-measuring

its prior equity interest in HSRE held before the acquisition. On June 11, 2015, the Company acquired its joint venture partners’ remaining 1% interest in HSRE for $1,267. Since the Company
retained its controlling interest, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest was reduced to zero to reflect this purchase, and the difference between the price paid by the
Company and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity attributable to the Company.

On
February 13, 2013, the Company acquired its joint venture partner’s 48% equity interest in Extra Space of Eastern Avenue LLC (“Eastern Avenue”), which owned one store located in Maryland, for approximately $5,979. Prior to
the acquisition, the remaining 52% interest was owned by the Company, which accounted for its investment in Eastern Avenue using the equity method. The Company recorded a non-cash gain of $2,215 related to this transaction, which represents the
increase in fair value of the Company’s interest in Eastern Avenue from its formation to the acquisition date.

On February 13,
2013, the Company acquired its joint venture partner’s 61% equity interest in Extra Space of Montrose Avenue LLC (“Montrose”), which owned one store located in Illinois, for approximately $6,878. Prior to the acquisition, the
remaining 39% interest was owned by the Company, which accounted for its investment in Montrose using the equity method. The Company recorded a non-cash gain of $341 related to this transaction, which represents the increase in fair value of the
Company’s interest in the joint venture from its formation to the acquisition date.

principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing
the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the
receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the
Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s investments and borrowings.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to
interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts
from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. A portion of these changes is excluded from accumulated other comprehensive income as
it is allocated to noncontrolling interests. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. During 2016, the Company estimates
that an additional $12,440 will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

The following table summarizes the terms of the
Company’s 29 derivative financial instruments, which have a total combined notional amount of $1,743,790 as of December 31, 2015:

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

The Company has agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain provisions pursuant to which, the Company could be declared
in default of its derivative obligations if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender.

The Company also has an agreement with some of its derivative counterparties that incorporates the loan covenant provisions of the
Company’s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with the loan covenant provisions would result in the Company being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement.

As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any
adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was $6,991. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions as of
December 31, 2015, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $2,995, including accrued interest.

NOTES PAYABLE TO TRUSTS

During July 2005, ESS Statutory Trust III (the “Trust III”), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a

wholly-owned,

unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, issued an aggregate of $40,000 of preferred securities which mature on July 31, 2035. In addition, the Trust III issued 1,238 of Trust
common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price of $1,238. On July 27, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities of $41,238 were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating



Partnership (“Note 3”). Note 3 had a fixed rate of 6.91% through July 31, 2010, and then was payable at a variable rate equal to the

three-month

LIBOR plus 2.40% per annum. Effective July 11, 2011, the Trust III entered into an interest rate swap that fixes the interest rate to be paid at 4.99% per annum and matures July 11, 2018.
The interest on Note 3, payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust III to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities became redeemable by the Trust III with no prepayment premium on July 27, 2010.

During May 2005, ESS Statutory Trust II (the “Trust II”), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a

wholly-owned,

unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership of the Company, issued an aggregate of $41,000 of preferred securities which mature on June 30, 2035. In addition, the Trust II issued 1,269
of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price of $1,269. On May 24, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities of $42,269 were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership
(“Note 2”). Note 2 had a fixed rate of 6.67% through June 30, 2010, and then was payable at a variable rate equal to the

three-month

LIBOR plus 2.40% per annum. Effective July 11,
2011, the Trust II entered into an interest rate swap that fixes the interest rate to be paid at 4.99% per annum and matures July 11, 2018. The interest on Note 2, payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust II to pay dividends on the
trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities became redeemable by the Trust II with no prepayment premium on June 30, 2010.

During April 2005, ESS Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a

wholly-owned,

unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership of the Company issued an aggregate of $35,000 of trust preferred securities which mature on June 30, 2035. In addition, the Trust
issued 1,083 of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price of $1,083. On April 8, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred and common securities of $36,083 were loaned in the form of a note to the
Operating Partnership (the “Note”). The Note has a variable rate equal to the

three-month

LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. Effective June 30, 2010, the Trust entered into an interest rate swap that
fixes the interest rate to be paid at 5.14% per annum and matures on June 30, 2018. The interest on the Note, payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities are
redeemable by the Trust with no prepayment premium.

Trust, Trust II and Trust III (together, the “Trusts”) are VIEs because the
holders of the equity investment at risk (the trust preferred securities) do not have the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly affect the entities’ economic performance because of their lack of voting or
similar rights. Because the Operating Partnership’s investment in the Trusts’ common securities was financed directly by the Trusts as a result of its loan of the proceeds to the Operating Partnership, that investment is not considered to
be an equity investment at risk. The Operating Partnership’s investment in the Trusts is not a variable interest because equity interests are variable interests only to the extent that the investment is considered to be at risk, and therefore
the Operating Partnership cannot be the primary beneficiary of the Trusts. Since the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Trusts, they have not been consolidated. A debt obligation has been recorded in the form of notes as discussed above
for the proceeds, which are owed to the Trusts by the Company. The Company has also recorded its investment in the Trusts’ common securities as other assets.

The Company has not provided financing or other support during the periods presented to the Trusts that it was not previously contractually
obligated to provide. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the Trusts is equal to the total amount of the notes discussed above less the amounts of the Company’s investments in the Trusts’ common
securities. The net amount is the notes payable that the Trusts owe to third parties for their investments in the Trusts’ preferred securities.

The notes payable to trusts are presented net of unamortized deferred financing costs of $2,399 and $2,531 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.



Following is a tabular comparison of the liabilities the Company has recorded as a result of its

EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR NOTES

In September 2015, the Operating Partnership issued $575,000 of its 3.125% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2035. Costs
incurred to issue the 2015 Notes were approximately $11,992, consisting primarily of a 2% underwriting fee. These costs are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over five years, which represents the estimated term based on the first
available redemption date, and are included in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The 2015 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are fully guaranteed by the Company. Interest is
payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning April 1, 2016, until the maturity date of October 1, 2035. The Notes bear interest at 3.125% per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the 2015 Notes may, under
certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash (for the principal amount of the 2015 Notes) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, for cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the
Company’s common stock, at the Company’s option. The exchange rate of the 2015 Notes as of December 31, 2015 was approximately 10.48 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2015 Notes.

The Operating Partnership may redeem the 2015 Notes at any time to preserve the Company’s status as a REIT. In addition, on or after
October 5, 2020, the Operating Partnership may redeem the 2015 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice to the holders
of the 2015 Notes. The holders of the 2015 Notes have the right to require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the 2015 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, on October 1 of the years 2020, 2025 and 2030, (unless the Operating Partnership has
called the 2015 Notes for redemption), and upon the occurrence of certain designated events, in each case for a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2015 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Certain events are considered
“Events of Default,” as defined in the indenture governing the 2015 Notes, which may result in the accelerated maturity of the 2015 Notes.

On June 21, 2013, the Operating Partnership issued $250,000 of its 2.375% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2033 at a 1.5% discount, or $3,750.
Costs incurred to issue the 2013 Notes were approximately $1,672. These costs are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over five years, which represents the estimated term based on the first available redemption date, and are
included in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The 2013 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are fully guaranteed by the Company. Interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 of each
year beginning January 1, 2014, until the maturity date of July 1, 2033. The 2013 Notes bear interest at 2.375% per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the 2013 Notes may, under certain circumstances, be
exchangeable for cash (for the principal amount of the 2013 Notes) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, for cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the
Company’s option. The exchange rate of the 2013 Notes as of December 31, 2015 was approximately 18.18 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2013 Notes.



Additionally, the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes can be exchanged during any calendar quarter, if
the last reported sale price of the common stock of the Company is greater than or equal to 130% of the exchange price for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately
preceding calendar quarter. The price of the Company’s common stock exceeded 130% of the exchange price for the required time period for the 2013 Notes during the quarter ended December 31, 2015. Therefore, holders of the 2013 Notes may elect
to exchange such notes during the quarter ending March 31, 2016. The price of the Company’s common stock did not exceed 130% of the exchange price for the required time period for the 2015 Notes during the quarter ended December 31, 2015.

The Operating Partnership may redeem the 2013 Notes at any time to preserve the Company’s status as a REIT. In addition, on or after July
5, 2018, the Operating Partnership may redeem the 2013 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice to the holders of the
2013 Notes. The holders of the 2013 Notes have the right to require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the 2013 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, on July 1 of the years 2018, 2023 and 2028, and upon the occurrence of certain designated
events, in each case for a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Certain events are considered “Events of Default,” as defined in the indenture governing the 2013 Notes,
which may result in the accelerated maturity of the 2013 Notes.

GAAP requires entities with convertible debt instruments that may be
settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. The Company therefore accounts for the
liability and equity components of the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes separately. The equity components are included in paid-in capital in stockholders’ equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, and the value of the equity components are
treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt components. The discounts are being amortized as interest expense over the remaining period of the debt through its first redemption date, July 1, 2018 for the 2013 Notes and
October 1, 2020 for the 2015 Notes. The effective interest rate on the liability components of both the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes is 4.0%, which approximates the market rate of interest of similar debt without exchange features (i.e.
nonconvertible debt) at the time of issuance.

Repurchase of 2013 Notes

As part of the 2015 Notes offering, the Company repurchased $164,636 of the 2013 Notes for $227,212 on September 15, 2015. The Company
allocated the value of the consideration paid to repurchase the 2013 Notes (1) to the extinguishment of the liability component and (2) to the reacquisition of the equity component. The amount allocated to the extinguishment of the liability
component is equal to the fair value of that component immediately prior to extinguishment. The difference between the consideration attributed to the extinguishment of the liability component and the sum of (a) the net carrying amount of the
repurchased liability component, and (b) the related unamortized debt issuance costs, is recognized as a gain on debt extinguishment. The remaining settlement consideration is allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component of the repurchased
2013 Notes and recognized as a reduction of stockholders’ equity.

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST REPRESENTED BY PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS

Classification of Noncontrolling Interests

GAAP requires a company to present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial
statements within the equity section, but separate from the company’s equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the
face of the consolidated statement of operations and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as equity transactions. If noncontrolling interests are determined to be redeemable, they are to be carried at their redemption
value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity.

The Company has evaluated the terms of the Operating
Partnership’s preferred units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by such preferred units as stockholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual
noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling amount as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as
temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying amount, or (2) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made.

Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Units

On June 15, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a Contribution Agreement with various limited partnerships affiliated with AAAAA

Rent-A-Space

to acquire ten stores in exchange for 989,980 Series A Units. The stores are located in California and Hawaii.

The partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership (as amended, the “Partnership Agreement”) provides for the designation and
issuance of the Series A Units. The Series A Units have priority over all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

Under the Partnership Agreement, Series A Units in the amount of $115,000 bear a fixed priority return of 5.0% and have a fixed
liquidation value of $115,000. The remaining balance participates in distributions with, and has a liquidation value equal to, that of the common OP Units. The Series A Units became redeemable at the option of the holder on September 1,
2008, which redemption obligation may be satisfied, at the Company’s option, in cash or shares of its common stock.

On June 25,
2007, the Operating Partnership loaned the holders of the Series A Units $100,000. The note receivable bears interest at 4.85%. During 2013, a loan amendment was signed extending the maturity date to September 1, 2020. The loan is secured
by the borrower’s Series A Units. The holders of the Series A Units could redeem up to 114,500 Series A Units prior to the maturity date of the loan. If any redemption in excess of 114,500 Series A Units occurs prior to the
maturity date, the holder of the Series A Units is required to repay the loan as of the date of that redemption. On October 3, 2014, the holders of the Series A Units redeemed 114,500 Series A Units for $4,794 in cash and 280,331 shares of
common stock. No additional redemption of Series A Units can be made without repayment of the loan. The Series A Units are shown on the balance sheet net of the $100,000 loan because the borrower under the loan receivable is also the holder of
the Series A Units.

Series B Redeemable Preferred Units

On April 3, 2014, the Operating Partnership completed the purchase of a store located in Georgia. This store was acquired in exchange for
$15,158 of cash and 333,360 Series B Units valued at $8,334.

On August 29, 2013, the Operating Partnership completed the purchase of
19 out of 20 stores affiliated with All Aboard Mini Storage, all of which are located in California. On September 26, 2013, the Operating



Partnership completed the purchase of the remaining facility. These stores were acquired in exchange for $100,876 in cash (including $98,960 of debt assumed and immediately defeased at closing),
1,342,727 Series B Units valued at $33,569, and 1,448,108 common OP Units valued at $62,341.

The Partnership Agreement provides for
the designation and issuance of the Series B Units. The Series B Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series C Units and Series D Units, and senior to all other partnership interests of the Operating
Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

The Series B Units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit for a
fixed liquidation value of $41,903. Holders of the Series B Units receive distributions at an annual rate of 6.0%. These distributions are cumulative. The Series B Units are redeemable at the option of the holder on the first anniversary
of the date of issuance, which redemption obligations may be satisfied at the Company’s option in cash or shares of its common stock.

Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units

On November 19, 2013, the Operating Partnership entered into Contribution Agreements with various entities affiliated with Grupe, under which
the Company agreed to acquire twelve stores, all of which are located in California. The Company completed the purchase of these stores between December 2013 and May 2014. The Company previously held a 35% interest in five of these stores and a 40%
interest in one store through six separate joint ventures with Grupe. These stores were acquired in exchange for a total of approximately $45,722 of cash, the assumption of $37,532 in existing debt, and the issuance of 704,016 Series C Units valued
at $30,960.

The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series C Units. The Series C Units rank
junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series B Units and Series D Units, and senior to all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

The Series C Units have a liquidation value of $42.10 per unit for a fixed liquidation value of $29,639. From issuance to the fifth
anniversary of issuance, each Series C Unit holder will receive quarterly distributions equal to the quarterly distribution for common OP Unit plus $0.18. Beginning on the fifth anniversary of issuance, each Series C Unit holder will
receive a fixed quarterly distribution equal to the aggregate quarterly distribution payable in respect of such Series C Unit during the four quarters immediately preceding the fifth anniversary of issuance divided by four. These distributions
are cumulative. The Series C Units will become redeemable at the option of the holder one year from the date of issuance, which redemption obligation may be satisfied at the Company’s option in cash or shares of its common stock. The
Series C Units will also become convertible into common OP Units at the option of the holder one year from the date of issuance, at a rate of 0.9145 common OP Units per Series C Unit converted. This conversion option expires upon the fifth
anniversary of the date of issuance.

In December 2014, the Operating Partnership loaned holders of the Series C Units $20,230. The
notes receivable, which are collateralized by the Series C Units, bear interest at 5.0% and mature on December 15, 2024. The Series C Units are shown on the balance sheet net of the $20,230 loan because the borrower under the loan receivable is also
the holder of the Series C Units.

Series D Redeemable Preferred Units

In December 2014, the Operating Partnership completed the acquisition of a store located in Florida. This store was acquired in exchange
for $5,621 in cash and 548,390 Series D Units valued at $13,710.

The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of
the Series D Units. The Series D Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series B Units and Series C Units, and senior to all other partnership interest of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and
liquidation.



The Series D Units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit, for a fixed liquidation value of
$13,710. Holders of the Series D Units receive distributions at an annual rate of 5.0%. These distributions are cumulative. The Series D Units will become redeemable at the option of the holder on the first anniversary of the date of issuance, which
redemption obligation may be satisfied at the Company’s option in cash or shares of its common stock.

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

The Company’s interest in its stores is held through the Operating Partnership. ESS Holding Business Trust I, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. ESS Business Trust II, also a

wholly-owned

subsidiary of the Company, is a limited partner of the Operating
Partnership. Between its general partner and limited partner interests, the Company held a 92.9% majority ownership interest therein as of December 31, 2015. The remaining ownership interests in the Operating Partnership (including Preferred
Operating Partnership units) of 7.1% are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership had 5,621,642 OP Units outstanding.

The noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership represents OP Units that are not owned by the Company. In conjunction with the
formation of the Company and as a result of subsequent acquisitions, certain persons and entities contributing interests in stores to the Operating Partnership received limited partnership units in the form of OP Units. Limited partners who received
OP Units in the formation transactions or in exchange for contributions for interests in stores have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of their OP Units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent
number of shares of the Company’s common stock (10 day average) at the time of the redemption. Alternatively, the Company may, at its sole discretion, elect to acquire those OP Units in exchange for shares of its common stock on a
one-for-one basis, subject to

anti-dilution

adjustments provided in the Operating Partnership agreement. The ten day average closing stock price at December 31, 2015, was $88.75 and there were 5,621,642
OP Units outstanding. Assuming that all of the unit holders exercised their right to redeem all of their OP Units on December 31, 2015 and the Company elected to pay the non-controlling members cash, the Company would have paid $498,921 in cash
consideration to redeem the units.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, a total of 787,850 OP Units were redeemed in exchange for the
Company’s common stock.

On November 13, 2015, the Company purchased one store located in Texas. As part of the consideration
for this acquisition, 91,434 OP Units were issued with a total value of $7,221.

On October 1, 2015, the Company acquired
SmartStop. As part of the consideration for this acquisition, 376,848 OP Units were issued with a total value of $28,656.

On June
18, 2015, the Company purchased one store located in Florida. As part of the consideration for this acquisition, 71,054 OP Units were issued with a total value of $4,773.

On April 15, 2015, the Company purchased 22 stores located in Arizona and Texas. As part of the consideration for this acquisition, 1,504,277
OP Units were issued with a total value of $101,749.

In December 2014, the Company purchased a single store in California. As part
of the consideration, 50,620 OP Units were issued for a value of $2,983.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, a total of 18,859 OP
Units were redeemed in exchange for the Company’s common stock.

In October 2013, 12,500 OP Units were redeemed in exchange for the
Company’s common stock. In March and April 2013, 1,000 OP Units were redeemed in exchange for $41 in cash.



On August 29, 2013 and September 26, 2013, the Company purchased 20 stores in
California. As part of the consideration, 1,448,108 OP Units were issued for a value of $62,341.

GAAP requires a company to present
ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company’s equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income
attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as equity
transactions. If noncontrolling interests are determined to be redeemable, they are to be carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity.

The Company has evaluated the terms of the common OP Units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by the common OP Units as
stockholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling amount as permanent equity in the
consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying amount, or (2) its redemption value as of the end
of the period in which the determination is made.

17.

OTHER NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Other noncontrolling interests represent the ownership interest of third parties in two consolidated joint ventures as of
December 31, 2015. One of these consolidated joint ventures owns a single operating store in California, and the other owns a store under development in Texas. The voting interests of the third-party owners range from 17.5% to 20.0%. Other
noncontrolling interests are included in the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The income or losses attributable to this third-party owner based on its ownership percentage are reflected
in net income allocated to Operating Partnership and other noncontrolling interests in the condensed consolidated statements of operations

On June 11, 2015, the Company purchased its joint venture partner’s remaining 1% interest in HSRE for $1,267. HSRE owned 19 properties in
California, Florida, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, and as a result of this purchase, these properties became wholly-owned by the Company. Prior to this acquisition, the partner’s interest was reported in other
noncontrolling interests. Since the Company retained its controlling interest in the subsidiary, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest was reduced to zero to reflect the
purchase, and the difference between the price paid by the Company and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity attributable to the Company.

In November 2013, the Company purchased its joint venture partner’s 10% membership interest in an existing joint venture for $1,292. The
joint venture owned a single store located in California, and as a result of the acquisition, the store became wholly-owned by the Company. Since the Company retained its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary, this transaction was
accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest was reduced to zero to reflect the purchase, and the difference between the price paid by the Company and the adjustment to the carrying value of the
noncontrolling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity attributable to the parent.

In May 2013, the Company purchased one of its
joint venture partner’s 27.6% capital interest and 35% profit interest in a previously unconsolidated joint venture for $950. The partner’s interest was reported in other noncontrolling interests prior to the purchase. As a result of the
acquisition, the store became wholly-owned by the Company. Since the Company retained its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling
interest was reduced to zero to reflect the purchase and the difference between the price paid by the Company and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity attributable to the parent.



In February 2013, the Company purchased one of its joint venture partner’s 1.7% capital
interest and 17% profit interest in a consolidated store for $200. As a result, the Company’s capital interest percentage in this joint venture increased from 95% to 96.7%. Since the Company retained its controlling financial interest in the
subsidiary, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest was reduced to reflect the purchase and the difference between the price paid by the Company and the adjustment to the
carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity attributable to the parent.

18.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

As of December 31, 2015, 4,658,171 shares were available for issuance under the Company’s 2015 Incentive Award
Plan (the “Plan”).

Option grants are issued with an exercise price equal to the closing price of stock on the date of grant.
Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee (“CNG Committee”) at the time of grant, options shall vest ratably over a

four-year

period beginning on the date
of grant. Each option will be exercisable once it has vested. Options are exercisable at such times and subject to such terms as determined by the CNG Committee, but under no circumstances may be exercised if such exercise would cause a violation of
the ownership limit in the Company’s charter. Options expire 10 years from the date of grant.

Also as defined under the terms
of the Plan, restricted stock grants may be awarded. The stock grants are subject to a vesting period over which the restrictions are released and the stock certificates are given to the grantee. During the performance or vesting period, the grantee
is not permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or assign shares of restricted stock granted under the Plan; however, the grantee has the ability to vote the shares and receive nonforfeitable dividends paid on shares. Unless otherwise
determined by the CNG Committee at the time of grant, the forfeiture and transfer restrictions on the shares lapse over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total value (the difference
between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2015 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of

in-the-money

options) that would have been received by the option holders had
all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2015. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock.

The weighted average fair value of stock options granted in 2015, 2014 and 2013, was $16.89, $12.03 and $9.74, respectively. The fair value of
each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

Dividend yield

Risk-free interest rate

The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate is based on
the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for the estimated life of the option. The Company uses actual historical data to calculate the expected price volatility, dividend yield and average expected term. The forfeiture rate,
which is estimated at a

weighted-average

of 5.0% of unvested options outstanding as of December 31, 2015, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected
to differ, from the previous estimates.

The Company recorded compensation expense relating to outstanding options of $510, $456 and $536 in general
and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Total cash received for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, related to option exercises was $1,542, $3,095 and $5,896,
respectively. At December 31, 2015, there was $1,427 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options under the Company’s 2004 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over
a

weighted-average

period of 2.58 years. The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time, including the expected forfeiture rate.
Therefore, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense at December 31, 2015, noted above does not necessarily represent the expense that will ultimately be realized by the Company in the statement of operations.



Common Stock Granted to Employees and Directors

The Company recorded $5,545, $4,528 and $4,283 of expense in general and administrative expense in its statement of operations related to
outstanding shares of common stock granted to employees and directors for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The forfeiture rate, which is estimated at a

weighted-average

of
10.2% of unvested awards outstanding as of December 31, 2015, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimates. At December 31, 2015 there was $11,868
of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards under the Company’s 2004 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.45 years.

The fair value of common stock awards is determined based on the closing trading price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

The Company has a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code under which eligible
employees can contribute up to 15% of their annual salary, subject to a statutory prescribed annual limit. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company made matching contributions to the plan of $1,680, $1,529 and $1,013,
respectively, based on 100% of the first 3% and up to 50% of the next 2% of an employee’s compensation.

20.

INCOME TAXES

As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which is
distributed annually to its stockholders. However, the Company has elected to treat one of its corporate subsidiaries, Extra Space Management, Inc., as a taxable REIT subsidiary. In general, the Company’s TRS may perform additional
services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740,

“Income Taxes.”

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company has elected to use the Tax-Law-Ordering approach to determine
when excess tax benefits will be realized.



The income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, is comprised

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has operating leases on its corporate offices and owns 19 stores that are subject to leases. At
December 31, 2015, future minimum rental payments under these non-cancelable operating leases were as follows (unaudited):

Less than 1 year

Year 4

Year 5

Thereafter

$

79,926

The monthly rental amounts for two of the ground leases include contingent rental payments based on the level
of revenue achieved at the stores. The Company recorded expense of $3,858, $3,406 and $3,032 related to these ground leases in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings and is subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of
business. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, management establishes an accrued liability for
litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The estimated loss, if any, is based upon currently available
information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. Therefore, any estimate(s) of loss disclosed below represents what management believes to be an estimate of loss only for certain
matters meeting these criteria and does not represent our maximum loss exposure. The Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in any
particular period, notwithstanding the fact that the Company is currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against it.

The
Company currently has several legal proceedings pending against it that include causes of action alleging wrongful foreclosure, violations of various state specific self-storage statutes, and violations of various consumer fraud acts. As a result of
these litigation matters, the Company recorded a liability of $850 during the year ended December 31, 2014, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Although there can be no assurance, the Company is not aware of any material environmental liability, for which it believes it will be
ultimately responsible, that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, the uses and conditions of properties in the vicinity of the
Company’s properties, the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the Company is unaware with respect to its properties could result in future material environmental liabilities.

Item 9.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

(i)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
based on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to
apply its judgment in evaluating the

cost-benefit

relationship of possible controls and procedures.

We have a disclosure committee that is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure obligations
of the Company on a timely basis. The disclosure committee meets quarterly and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.

(ii)

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

(a)

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued the following attestation report over our
internal control over financial reporting.



(b)

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Extra Space Storage Inc.

We have audited Extra Space Storage Inc.’s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Extra Space Storage Inc.’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Extra Space Storage Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2015, and 2014 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of
Extra Space Storage Inc. and our report dated February 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
