performance, taking into account all information currently available to us.
These beliefs, assumptions and expectations are subject to risks and
uncertainties and can change as a result of many possible events or factors,
not all of which are known to us. If a change occurs, our business, financial
condition, liquidity and results of operations may vary materially from those
expressed in our forward-looking statements. You should carefully
consider these risks before you make an investment decision with respect to our
securities.

We disclaim any
duty or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements set
forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect new information,
future events or otherwise.


PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Extra Space Storage Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us” or
the “Company”) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment
trust (“REIT”) formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004 to own,
operate, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage
facilities. We closed our initial public offering (“IPO”) on August 17,
2004. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol “EXR.”

We were formed to continue the business of Extra Space
Storage LLC and its subsidiaries (the “Predecessor”), which had engaged in the
self-storage business since 1977. These companies were reorganized after the
consummation of our IPO and various formation transactions. As of December 31,
2006, we held ownership interests in 567 properties located in 32 states and
Washington, D.C. with an aggregate of approximately 41 million square feet
of net rentable space and greater than 280,000 customers. Of these 567
properties, 219 are wholly-owned, and 348 are owned in joint-venture
partnerships. An additional 74 properties are owned by franchisees or third
parties and operated by us in exchange for a management fee, bringing total
properties which we own and/or manage to 641.

We operate in two distinct segments: (1) property
management and development and (2) rental operations. Our property
management and development activities include acquiring, managing, developing
and selling self-storage facilities. The rental operations activities include
rental operations of self-storage facilities.

Substantially all of our business is conducted through
Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating Partnership”), and through our wholly-owned
Massachusetts business trust subsidiaries. Our primary assets are general
partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This
structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT.
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). To the extent we continue to qualify
as a REIT we will not be subject to tax, with certain exceptions, on our net
taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders.

We file our annual report
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports
on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You may obtain copies of these documents
by visiting the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20549, by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330
or by accessing the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, as soon
as reasonably practicable after such materials are furnished to the SEC, we
make copies of these documents available to the public free of charge through
our website at www.extraspace.com, or by contacting our Secretary at our
principal offices, which are located at 2795 Cottonwood Parkway, Suite 400,
Salt Lake City, Utah 84121, telephone number (801) 562-5556.

Management

Members of our executive management team have
significant experience in all aspects of the self-storage industry, and have an
average of more than ten years of industry experience. The senior management
team has collectively acquired and/or developed more than 675 properties during
the past 25 years for the Company, the Predecessor and other entities.
Kenneth M. Woolley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard S.
Tanner, Senior Vice President Development, have worked in the self-storage
industry since 1977 and led some of the earliest self-storage facility
development projects in the United States.


The remainder of our executive management team and
their years of industry experience are as follows: Kent Christensen, Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 9 years; Charles Allen,
Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, 9 years; and Karl Haas,
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, 19 years.

Members of the executive management team have guided
the Company through substantial growth, developing and acquiring over $2.9
billion in assets since 1996. This growth has been funded through equity
offerings and more than $2.0 billion in private equity capital since 1998.
This private equity capital has come primarily from sophisticated, high net-worth
individuals and institutional investors such as affiliates of Prudential
Financial, Inc. and Fidelity Investments.

Our executive management
and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the Company
with executive officers and directors owning approximately 4.4 million shares
or 6.8% of our outstanding common stock as of February 15, 2007.

Industry &
Competition

Self-storage facilities refers to properties that
offer do-it-yourself, month-to-month storage space rental for personal or
business use. Self-storage offers a cost-effective and flexible storage
alternative. Tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according
to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited, exclusive access.
Tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units.
Self-storage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet
by 20 feet, with an interior height of eight to 12 feet. Properties generally
have on-site managers who supervise and run the day-to-day operations,
providing tenants with assistance as needed.

Self-storage provides a convenient way for individuals
and businesses to store their possessions, due to life-changes, or simply
because of a need for storage space. The mix of residential tenants using a
self-storage property is determined by a property’s local demographics and
often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others
who are not yet settled into a permanent residence.

Items that residential tenants place in self-storage
properties range from cars, boats and recreational vehicles, to furniture,
household items and appliances. Commercial tenants tend to include small
business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods, records, extra
inventory or storage for seasonal goods.

Our research has shown that tenants choose a
self-storage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their
home or business, making high-density, high-traffic population centers ideal locations
for a self-storage property. A property’s perceived security and the general
professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to
a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals. Although most self-storage
properties are leased to tenants on a month-to-month basis, tenants tend to
continue their leases for extended periods of time.

There are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for
self-storage properties. Based on our experience, generally, there is increased
leasing activity at self-storage properties during the summer months due to the
higher number of people who relocate during this period. The highest level of
occupancy is typically at the end of July, while the lowest level of occupancy
is seen in late February and early March.

Since inception in the early 1970’s the self-storage
industry has experienced significant growth. In the past ten years, there has
been even greater growth. According to the Self-Storage Almanac (the “Almanac”),
in 1996 there were only 25,180 self-storage properties in the United States,
with an average occupancy rate of 88.5% of net rentable square feet compared to
42,976 self-storage properties in 2006 with an average occupancy rate of 83.0 %
of net rentable square feet. As population densities have


increased in the United
States, there has been an increase in self-storage awareness and corresponding
development, which we expect will continue in the future.

Increased competition has affected our business and
has led to both pricing and discount pressure. This has limited our ability to
increase revenues in many markets in which we operate. Many markets have been
able to absorb the increase in self-storage development due to superior
demographics and density. However, select markets have not been able to absorb
the new facilities and have not performed as well.

We have encountered competition when we seek to
acquire properties, especially for brokered portfolios. Aggressive bidding
practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities, and
this competition will continue to be a challenge for the Company’s growth
strategy.

Increased development within the self-storage industry
has also led to an increased emphasis on site location, property design,
innovation and functionality. We strive to have a creative and flexible
approach to our development projects and we are open to a broad array of
opportunities because of this flexibility. This is especially true for new
sites slated for high-density population centers, to accommodate the
requirements and tastes of local planning and zoning boards, and to distinguish
a facility from other offerings in the market. Due to the attractive
architecture of many of our development properties, we have been able to
eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most self-storage developers in areas
usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial users.

The industry is also characterized by fragmented
ownership. According to the 2007 Almanac, the top ten self-storage companies in
the United States owned approximately 11.6% of total U.S. self-storage
properties, and the top 50 self-storage companies owned approximately 15.5% of
the total U.S. properties. We believe this fragmentation will contribute to
continued consolidation at some level in the future. We also believe we are
well positioned to be able to compete for acquisitions given our enhanced
ability to access capital as a public company and our historical reputation for
closing deals.

After our acquisition of
the Storage USA properties on July 14, 2005, we became the second largest
self-storage operator in the United States. We are now one of four public
self-storage REITS along with Public Storage Inc. (NYSE: PSA), Sovran
Self-Storage, Inc. (NYSE: SSS), and U-Store-It Inc. (NYSE: YSI).

Growth and
Investment Strategies

Our primary
business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our
stockholders and to achieve sustainable long-term growth in cash flow per share
in order to maximize long-term stockholder value. We continue to evaluate a
range of growth initiatives and opportunities. These include:

·

Maximize the performance of
properties through strategic, efficient and proactive management.

We
plan to pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our
operations. Our revenue management team will seek to maximize revenue by
responding to changing market conditions through our technology system’s
ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management.
Our scale allows greater ability than the majority of our competitors to
implement national, regional and local marketing programs, which we believe
will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.

·

Focus on the acquisition of
self-storage properties from strategic partners and third parties.

Our
acquisitions team will continue to pursue the acquisition of single properties
and multi-property portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value.
Our July 2005 acquisition of Storage USA has bolstered our reputation as a
reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and
close non-brokered, private deals. In addition, our status as an umbrella
partnership real estate investment trust enables flexibility when structuring
deals.


·

Develop new self-storage
properties

.

We have several joint venture and wholly-owned
development properties and will continue to develop new self-storage properties
in our core markets. Our development pipeline through 2009 includes 27
projects. The majority of the projects will be developed on a wholly-owned
basis by the Company.

·

Expand our management business

.

We see
the management business as a future acquisition pipeline and expect to pursue
strategic relationships with owners that should strengthen our acquisition
pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase
the managed property in the event of a potential sale. Twelve of our 2006
acquisitions came from this channel.

Financing of Our
Growth Strategies

·

Acquisition and Development Financing

We, as guarantor, and our
Operating Partnership currently have a $100 million revolving line of
credit (the “credit facility”) that is collateralized by our self-storage
properties. As of December 31, 2006, the credit facility had approximately
$81.0 million of available capacity based on the assets collateralizing the
credit facility. We expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new
property acquisitions. We plan to finance future acquisitions through a
combination of borrowings under the credit facility, traditional secured
mortgage financing and additional equity offerings.

·

Development Joint Venture Financing

We own 338 of our
stabilized properties and 10 of our lease-up properties through joint ventures
with third parties, including affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. In
each joint venture, we generally manage the day-to-day operations of the
underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions
relating to sales of properties or financings by the applicable joint venture.
Our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital
required for the operation of the respective business. Under the operating
agreements for the joint ventures, we typically maintain the right to receive
between 17.0% and 50.0% of the available cash flow from operations after our
joint venture partners have received a predetermined return, and between 17.0%
and 50.0% of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint
venture partners have received a return of their capital plus such
predetermined return. Most joint venture agreements include buy-sell rights, as
well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by
the joint venture.

·

Disposition of Properties

We will continue to review
our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically
located and determine whether to dispose of these properties to fund other
growth.

Regulation

Generally, self-storage properties are subject to
various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to
lien sale rights and procedures. Changes in any of these laws or regulations,
as well as changes in laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response
and Compensation Liability Act, or CERCLA, which increase the potential
liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by
tenants or others on properties, or laws affecting development, construction,
operation, upkeep, safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated
expenditures, loss of self-storage sites or other impairments to operations,
which would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the
“ADA”), all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal
requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements
became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local
laws also exist


that may require
modifications to the properties, or restrict further renovations thereof, with
respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could
result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants
and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, thereby
requiring substantial capital expenditures. To the extent our properties are
not in compliance, we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the
ADA.

Insurance activities are subject to state insurance
laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for
each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and are subject
to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations
promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.

Property management activities are often subject to
state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the
particular real estate commission for each state.

Changes in any of the laws
governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct
our business or could materially affect our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of February 15,
2007, we had 1,835 employees and believe our relationship with our employees to
be good. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining
agreement.

Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

An investment in our securities involves various
risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in
conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report before
trading in our securities. If any of the events set forth in the following
risks actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects and financial
condition could be harmed.

Our performance is subject
to risks associated with real estate investments. We are a real estate company
that derives our income from operation of our properties. There are a number of
factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate,
including the following:

Risks Related to
Our Properties and Operations

If we are unable to promptly re-let our units or if
the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than expected, then our
business and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Virtually all of our
leases are on a month-to-month basis. Any delay in re-letting units as
vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In
addition, lower than expected rental rates upon re-letting could impede our
growth.

We face increasing competition for the acquisition of
self-storage properties and other assets, which may impede our ability to make
future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions.

We compete with many other
entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of
self-storage properties and other assets, including national, regional and
local operators and developers of self-storage properties. These competitors
may drive up the price we must pay for self-storage properties or other assets we
seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets
themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our
competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater
resources, may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating
philosophy. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds
competing for suitable investment properties may increase. This competition
will result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices
paid for them. Because of an increased interest in single-property
acquisitions among tax-motivated individual purchasers, we may pay higher
prices if we purchase single properties in


comparison
with portfolio acquisitions. If we pay higher prices for self-storage
properties or other assets, our profitability will be reduced.

Our investments in development and redevelopment
projects may not yield anticipated returns, which would harm our operating
results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions.

A key component of
our growth strategy is exploring new asset development and redevelopment
opportunities through strategic joint ventures and on a wholly-owned basis. To
the extent that we engage in these development and redevelopment activities,
they will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these
projects:

·

we
may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at
all;

·

we
may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;

·

we
may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use,
building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations;
and

·

occupancy
rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate
depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and
may result in our investment not being profitable.

In deciding whether to develop or redevelop a
particular property, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future
performance of that property. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring
the property up to the standards established for its intended market position
or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly acquired property as quickly
as expected or at all. Any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could
adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment
projects and harm our operating results, liquidity and financial condition,
which could result in a decline in the value of our securities.

We may in the future develop self-storage properties
in geographic regions where we do not currently have a significant presence and
where we do not possess the same level of familiarity with development, which
could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties successfully or
at all or to achieve expected performance.

We rely on the investments
of our joint venture partners for funding our development and redevelopment
projects. If our reputation in the self-storage industry changes or the number
of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise
reduced, our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected,
which would limit our growth.

We may not be successful in identifying and
consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our
growth and negatively affect our stock price.

Our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral
to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition
candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are
compatible with our growth strategy. We may not be successful in identifying
suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in
consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all.
Failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth, which
could in turn adversely affect our stock price.


Our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms
and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following
significant risks:

·

competition
from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital,
including other publicly-traded REITs and institutional investment funds;

·

competition
from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price
which could reduce our profitability;

·

satisfactory
completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing
conditions;

·

failure
to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all;

·

we
may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary
improvements or renovations to acquired properties; and

·

we
may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with
only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities
for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by persons
dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification
by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former
owners of the properties.

In addition, strategic
decisions by us, such as acquisitions, may adversely affect the price of our
securities.

We may not be
successful in integrating and operating acquired properties.

We expect to make future
acquisitions of self-storage properties. If we acquire any self-storage
properties, we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio.
The acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth
strategy than originally anticipated, may cause disruptions in our operations
or may divert management’s attention away from day-to-day operations, which
could impair our results of operations as a whole.

We depend upon our on-site personnel to maximize
tenant satisfaction at each of our properties, and any difficulties we
encounter in hiring, training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm
our operating performance.

We had 1,618 field personnel
as of February 15, 2007 in the management and operation of our properties.
The general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing
factors to a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants.
We also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure self-storage
properties. If we are unable to successfully recruit, train and retain
qualified field personnel, the quality of service we strive to provide at our
properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy
levels and reduced operating performance.

Other self-storage operators may employ STORE or a
technology similar to STORE, which could enhance their ability to compete with
us.

We rely on STORE to
support all aspects of our business operations and to help us implement new
development and acquisition opportunities and strategies. If other self-storage
companies obtain a license to use STORE, or employ or develop a technology
similar to STORE, their ability to compete with us could be enhanced.


Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance
coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow.

We maintain comprehensive
liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as deemed necessary or as required by
our lenders), extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our
properties with policy specifications, limits and deductibles customarily
carried for similar properties. Certain types of losses, however, may be either
uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes,
hurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war or terrorism. Should an uninsured
loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and
cash flow from a property. In addition, if any such loss is insured, we may be
required to pay a significant deductible on any claim for recovery of such a
loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the
amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. As a result, our
operating results may be adversely affected.

Increases in taxes
and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income.

Costs resulting from
changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants
directly and will affect us. Increases in income, property or other taxes
generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net
income, funds from operations (“FFO”), cash flow, financial condition, ability
to pay or refinance our debt obligations, ability to make distributions to stockholders,
and the trading price of our securities. Similarly, changes in laws increasing
the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or
increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in
significant unanticipated expenditures, which could similarly adversely affect
our business and results of operations.

We do not always obtain independent appraisals of our
properties, and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the
value that may be indicated by third-party appraisals.

We do not always obtain third-party appraisals
in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being
paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value as determined
by third-party appraisals. In such cases, the terms of any agreements and
the valuation methods used to determine the value of the properties were
determined by our senior management team.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities
associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations.

Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws,
ordinances and regulations, owners and operators of real estate may be liable
for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or
other regulated materials on or in such property. Such laws often impose such
liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was
responsible for, the presence of such substances or materials. The presence of
such substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such
substances, may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to lease,
sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral.
Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or
other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation
of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such
facility is owned or operated by such person. Certain environmental laws impose
liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air and
third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for
personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials.

Certain environmental laws also impose liability,
without regard to knowledge or fault, for removal or remediation of hazardous
substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of
contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property.
Moreover, the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates
could be liable for any personal injuries or


property damages that may
result from such releases, as well as any damages to natural resources that may
arise from such releases.

Certain environmental laws impose compliance
obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the
management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances. For example,
environmental laws govern the management of asbestos-containing materials
and lead-based paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties
or other sanctions.

No assurances can be given
that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties
reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of our
properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us,
or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any
one or more of our properties. There also exists the risk that material
environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen
after the review was completed or may arise in the future. Finally, future
laws, ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws,
ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental
liability.

Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in
which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental
rates and therefore our operating results.

Our operating
results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental
rates in our self-storage properties. Adverse economic or other conditions in
the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our
ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts. If our
properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements,
including operating and other expenses, debt service and capital expenditures,
our net income, FFO, cash flow, financial condition, ability to make distributions
to stockholders and trading price of our securities could be adversely
affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the
operating performance of our properties:

·

the
national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the
markets in which we operate, which may be adversely impacted by, among other
factors, industry slowdowns, relocation of businesses and changing
demographics;

·

periods
of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand
for self-storage or the public perception that any of these events may occur
could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant
defaults;

·

local
or regional real estate market conditions such as the oversupply of self-storage
or a reduction in demand for self-storage in a particular area;

·

perceptions
by prospective users of our self-storage properties of the safety, convenience
and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are
located;

·

increased
operating costs, including need for capital improvements, insurance premiums,
real estate taxes and utilities;

·

changes
in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area;

·

the
impact of environmental protection laws;

·

earthquakes,
hurricanes and other natural disasters, terrorist acts, civil disturbances or
acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses; and

·

changes in tax, real estate
and zoning laws.


Risks Related to
Our Organization and Structure

Our business could be harmed if key personnel with
long-standing business relationships in the self-storage industry terminate
their employment with us.

Our success depends, to a
significant extent, on the continued services of our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and the other members of our executive management team. Our
executive management team has substantial experience in the self-storage
industry. In addition, our ability to continue to develop properties depends on
the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with
our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of Prudential
Financial, Inc. There is no guarantee that any of them will remain
employed by us. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers.
The loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team,
particularly our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, could harm our business
and our prospects.

We may change our investment and financing strategies
and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent, which may
subject us to different risks.

We may change our
investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business
without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different risks. We may
change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of
business at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could
result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are
different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses
described in this document. A change in our investment strategy or our entry
into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real
estate market fluctuations.

If other self-storage companies convert to an UPREIT
structure or if tax laws change, we may no longer have an advantage in
competing for potential acquisitions.

Because we are structured
as an UPREIT, we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to tax-motivated
sellers than our competitors that are not structured as UPREITs. However, if
other self-storage companies restructure their holdings to become UPREITs, this
competitive advantage will disappear. In addition, new legislation may be
enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), or the U.S. Treasury Department that could
affect the attractiveness of our UPREIT structure so that it may no longer
assist us in competing for acquisitions.

Tax indemnification
obligations may require the Operating Partnership to maintain certain debt
levels.

In connection with the
formation transactions entered into prior to our IPO in 2004, we agreed to make
available to each of Kenneth M. Woolley, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, Richard S. Tanner, our Senior Vice President, Development, and other
third parties, the following tax protections: for nine years, with a three-year
extension if the applicable party continues to own at least 50% of the OP units
received by it in the formation transactions at the expiration of the initial
nine-year period, the opportunity to (1) guarantee debt or (2) enter
into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation, in an
aggregate amount, with respect to the foregoing contributors, of at least
$60.0 million. We agreed to these provisions in order to assist these
contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions. These
obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness that we would not
otherwise require for our business.

Our joint venture
investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making
authority.

As of December 31,
2006, we held interests in 348 properties through joint ventures. All of these
arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making
authority, our reliance on co-venturers’ financial conditions and disputes
between us and our co-venturers. We expect to continue our


joint
venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of
developing new self-storage properties and acquiring existing properties. In
such event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making
authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity.
The decision-making authority regarding the properties we currently hold
through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture
partners, is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or
equally shared by us and the joint venture partners. In addition, investments
in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain
circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved,
including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt
or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or
co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are
inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to
take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also
have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because
neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the
partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers
may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and
prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on
our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or
co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or
joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances
be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers,
which could harm our financial condition.

Kenneth M. Woolley, our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, Spencer F. Kirk, one of our directors, Richard S.
Tanner, Senior Vice President, Development, Kent W. Christensen, Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Charles L. Allen,
Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, members of our senior
management team, have outside business interests which could divert their time
and attention away from us, which could harm our business.

Kenneth M. Woolley,
our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as one of our directors and
certain other members of our senior management team, have outside business
interests. These business interests include the ownership of a self-storage
property located in Pico Rivera, California, which as of December 31, 2006
was in lease-up, and the ownership of Extra Space Development LLC. Other than
this property and Extra Space Development, LLC, the members of our senior
management are not currently engaged in any other self-storage activities
outside the Company. In addition, Mr. Woolley’s employment agreement
includes an exception to his non-competition covenant pursuant to which he is
permitted to devote a portion of his time to the management and operations of Nevada
West Development, LLC (formerly known as RMI Development, LLC), a multi-family
business in which he has a majority ownership. Although Mr. Woolley’s
employment agreement requires that he devote substantially his full business
time and attention to us, this agreement also permits him to devote time to his
outside business interests. These outside business interests could interfere
with his ability to devote time to our business and affairs and as a result,
our business could be harmed.

Conflicts of
interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our Operating
Partnership.

Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a
result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, and our Operating
Partnership or any partner thereof. Our directors and officers have duties to
our Company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management
of our Company. At the same time, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, have
fiduciary duties, as a general partner, to our Operating Partnership and to the
limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of our
Operating Partnership. Our duties, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, as a
general partner to our Operating Partnership and its partners may come into
conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our Company. The
partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership does not require us to
resolve such conflicts in favor of either our Company or the limited partners
in our Operating Partnership.


Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant
partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a
Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which
it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness, and loyalty
and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or
engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest.

Additionally, the partnership agreement expressly
limits our liability by providing that neither we, our direct wholly-owned
Massachusetts business trust subsidiary, as the general partner of the
Operating Partnership, nor any of our or their trustees, directors or officers,
will be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, the
limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law
or for any act or omission if we, or such trustee, director or officer, acted
in good faith. In addition, our Operating Partnership is required to indemnify
us, our affiliates and each of our respective trustees, officers, directors,
employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several),
expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and other legal fees
and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any
and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Operating
Partnership, provided that our Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (1) willful
misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (2) any transaction for
which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach
of any provision of the partnership agreement, or (3) in the case of a
criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or
omission was unlawful.

The provisions of Delaware
law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified
by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we
have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in
the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary
duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership
agreement.

Our management’s ownership of contingent conversion
shares, or CCSs, and contingent conversion units, or CCUs, may cause them to
devote a disproportionate amount of time to the performance of the related
14 wholly-owned early-stage lease-up properties, which could cause
our overall operating performance to suffer.

In connection with our
IPO, we issued to certain contributors, which included certain members of our
senior management, CCSs and/or a combination of OP units and CCUs. The terms of
the CCSs and CCUs provide that they will convert into our common stock and OP
units, respectively, only if the relevant 14 lease-up properties
identified at the time of the IPO achieve specified performance thresholds
prior to December 31, 2008. As a result, our directors and officers who
own CCSs and CCUs may have an incentive to devote a disproportionately large
amount of their time and attention to these properties in comparison with our
remaining properties, which could harm our operating results.

We may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of
contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain
of our officers.

Kenneth M. Woolley,
our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Spencer F. Kirk, who serves as
director, Kent W. Christensen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, Charles L. Allen, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer,
and Richard S. Tanner, Senior Vice President, Development had direct or
indirect ownership interests in certain properties that were contributed to our
Operating Partnership in the formation transactions. Following the completion
of the formation transactions, we, under the agreements relating to the
contribution of such interests, became entitled to indemnification and damages
in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the
contributors. In addition, Kenneth M. Woolley’s employment agreement
includes an exception to his non-


competition
covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote time to the management and
operations of Nevada West Development, LLC (formerly known as RMI Development,
LLC), a multi-family business. None of these contribution and
non-competition agreements was negotiated at an arm’s-length basis. We
may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under
these contribution and non-competition agreements because of our desire to
maintain our ongoing relationships with the individuals party to these agreements.

Certain provisions of Maryland law and our
organizational documents, including the stock ownership limit imposed by our
charter, may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a
change in control transaction.

Our charter, subject to
certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are
necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT and to limit
any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 7.0% (by value
or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding
common stock or 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more
restrictive) of our outstanding capital stock. Our board of directors, in its
sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit.
However, our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership
limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our
qualification as a REIT. These restrictions on ownership will not apply if our
board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to
attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The ownership limit
may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a
premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our
stockholders. Different ownership limits apply to the family of Kenneth M.
Woolley, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts
formed for the benefit of the foregoing and Spencer F. Kirk, certain of
his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of
the foregoing and certain designated investment entities (as defined in our
charter).

Our board of directors has the power to issue
additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest
of our stockholders.

Our charter authorizes our
board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common
stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized
shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder
approval. In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any
unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences,
rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of
directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a
series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a
premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of
our stockholders.

Our rights and the
rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers
are limited.

Maryland law provides that
a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs
his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to
be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in
a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter
eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders
for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an
improper benefit in money, property or services or active and deliberate
dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause
of action. Our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for
liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the
maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, we and our stockholders
may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might


otherwise
exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense
costs incurred by our directors and officers.

To the extent our distributions represent a return of
capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders could recognize
an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock.

Distributions in excess of
our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a
dividend will not be taxable to a U.S. stockholder under current U.S. federal
income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholder’s
adjusted tax basis in his, her, or its common stock, but instead will
constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis. If
distributions result in a reduction of a stockholder’s adjusted basis in such
holder’s common stock, subsequent sales of such holder’s common stock will
result in recognition of an increased capital gain or realized capital loss due
to the reduction in such adjusted basis.

Risks Related to
the Real Estate Industry

Our primary
business involves the ownership, operation and development of self-storage
properties.

Our current strategy is to
own, operate and develop only self-storage properties. Consequently, we are
subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry. Because
investments in real estate are inherently illiquid, this strategy makes it
difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk
when economic conditions change. Decreases in market rents, negative tax, real
estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may
also increase our costs, lower the value of our investments and decrease our
income, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and
operating results.

Any negative
perceptions of the self-storage industry generally may result in a decline in
our stock price.

To the extent that the
investing public has a negative perception of the self-storage industry, the
value of our securities may be negatively impacted, which could result in our
securities trading below the inherent value of our assets.

Costs associated with complying with the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses.

Under the ADA, all places
of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements
related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became
effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws
may also require modifications to our properties, or restrict certain further
renovations of the properties, with respect to access thereto by disabled
persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or
an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to
correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital
expenditures. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our
properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost
of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If one or more of our
properties is not in compliance with the ADA or other legislation, then we
would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into
compliance. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or other
legislation, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per
share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt
service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders could be
adversely affected.


Illiquidity of real estate investments could
significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the
performance of our properties.

Because real estate investments are relatively
illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio
in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is
limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general
economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other
factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot
predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the
terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective
purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time
needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.

We may be required to
expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can
be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct
those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a property, we may
agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that
property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a
limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property.
These transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if
we deem it necessary or appropriate.

Any investments in unimproved real property may take
significantly longer to yield income-producing returns, if at all, and
may result in additional costs to us to comply with re-zoning restrictions or
environmental regulations.

We have invested in the
past, and may invest in the future, in unimproved real property. Unimproved
properties generally take longer to yield income-producing returns based
on the typical time required for development. Any development of unimproved
property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with
re-zoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns
of governmental entities and/or community groups. Any unsuccessful investments
or delays in realizing an income-producing return or increased costs to
develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted
rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay
operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating
results.

Risks Related to
Our Debt Financings

Required payments of principal and interest on
borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to
pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our
qualification as a REIT and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt
obligations.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately
$948.2 million of outstanding indebtedness. We expect to incur additional
debt in connection with future acquisitions. We may borrow under our line of
credit or borrow new funds to acquire these future properties. Additionally, we
do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to
repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and, therefore, we expect to
repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity and/or debt offerings.
Further, we may need to borrow funds to make distributions required to maintain
our qualification as a REIT or to meet our expected distributions.

If we are required
to utilize our line of credit for purposes other than acquisition activity,
this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our
growth. Therefore, our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our
debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the
following:

·

our
cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest
payments;

·

we
may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms,
including to make acquisitions or distributions required to maintain our
qualification as a REIT;


·

we
may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing
terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;

·

because
a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, an increase in interest
rates could materially increase our interest expense;

·

we
may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on
disadvantageous terms;

·

after
debt service, the amount available for distributions to our stockholders is
reduced;

·

our
debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
competitors with less debt;

·

we
may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns,
reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;

·

we
may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on
our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and
leases;

·

we
may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle
the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and

·

our default under any one
of our mortgage loans with cross-default or cross-collateralization
provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the
foreclosures of other properties.

We could become highly leveraged in the future because
our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may
incur.

Our organizational
documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our
Operating Partnership may incur. We could alter the balance between our total
outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time. If we
become more highly leveraged, then the resulting increase in debt service could
adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness
and to pay our anticipated distributions and/or the distributions required to
maintain our REIT qualification, and could harm our financial condition.

Increases in interest rates may increase our interest
expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our
indebtedness and make distributions to our stockholders.

As of December 31,
2006 we had approximately $948.2 million of debt outstanding, of which
approximately $85.1 million, or 9.0% was subject to variable interest
rates (including $61.8 million on which we had a reverse interest rate swap).
This variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately
6.6% per annum. Increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would
increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and our ability
to pay distributions. For example, if market rates of interest on this variable
rate debt increased by 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense would
decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $0.9 million annually.

Failure to hedge
effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of
operations.

In certain cases we may
seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate
hedging arrangements. Hedging involves risks, such as the risk that the
counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement. Failure to
hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to
our stockholders.


Risks Related to
Qualification and Operation as a REIT

To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may be
forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market
conditions.

To qualify as a REIT, we
generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable
income each year, excluding net capital gains, and we are subject to regular
corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net
taxable income each year. In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible
excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made by us in any
calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our
capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.
In order to maintain our REIT qualification and avoid the payment of income and
excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis, or possibly
long-term, to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then
prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These
borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual
receipt of cash and inclusion of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or
the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or
required debt amortization payments.

Dividends payable
by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.

The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends
paid by domestic corporations to individual U.S. stockholders is 15% (through
2008). Dividends paid by REITs, however, are generally not eligible for the
reduced rates. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate
dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments
in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of
non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the
value of the stock of REITs, including our securities.

In addition, the relative
attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the
favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends, which could negatively
affect the value of our properties.

Possible
legislative or other actions affecting REITs could adversely affect our
stockholders.

The rules dealing
with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons
involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury
Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive
application) could adversely affect our stockholders. It cannot be predicted
whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws
applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed.

The power of our board of directors to revoke our REIT
election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our
stockholders.

Our charter provides that
our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election,
without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer
in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify
as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable
income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable
income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total
return to our stockholders.

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have
significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.

We operate in a
manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes
under the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT or lose our
qualification as a REIT at any


time,
we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds
available for distribution for each of the years involved because:

·

we
would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing
our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular
corporate rates;

·

we
also could be subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and possibly
increased state and local taxes; and

·

unless
we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not
elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following a year during
which we were disqualified.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will
not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to
stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the
extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that our
U.S. individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains
rates, and our U.S. corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends
received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject, in each case, to
applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of all
these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability
to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value
of our securities.

Qualification as a REIT
involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code
provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative
interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable
Treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code
is greater in the case of a REIT that, like us, holds its assets through a
partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not
entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In
order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including
requirements regarding the composition of our assets and sources of our gross
income. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the
fair market value of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to precise
determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Also,
we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of
our net taxable income, excluding capital gains. In addition, legislation, new
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely
affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income
tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other
investments.

We will pay some
taxes.

Even though we qualify as
a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some
U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. Extra Space
Management, Inc. manages self-storage properties for our joint venture
properties and properties owned by third parties. We, jointly with Extra Space
Management, Inc., elected to treat Extra Space Management, Inc. as a “taxable
REIT subsidiary” of our Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A taxable
REIT subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation, and may be limited in its
ability to deduct interest payments made to us. In addition, we will be subject
to a 100% penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our
tenants, our taxable REIT subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar
arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or
property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. To the
extent that we are or our taxable REIT subsidiary is required to pay U.S.
federal, state or local taxes, we will have less cash available for
distribution to stockholders.


Complying with REIT
requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.

To qualify as a REIT for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning,
among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification
of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership
of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego
attractive business or investment opportunities. Thus, compliance with the REIT
requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize
profits.

Properties

As of December 31, 2006, we owned or had
ownership interests in 567 self-storage properties located in 32 states and
Washington, D.C. Of these properties, 219 are wholly-owned and 348 are
held in joint ventures. In addition, we managed an additional 74 properties for
franchisees or third parties bringing the total numbers of properties which we
own and/or manage to 641. We receive a management fee equal to approximately 6%
of gross revenues to manage the joint venture, third party and franchise sites.
As of December 31, 2006, we owned or had ownership interest in
approximately 41 million square feet of space configured in approximately
380,000 separate storage units. Approximately 70% of our properties are
clustered around the larger population centers, such as Atlanta,
Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles,
Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and
San Francisco. These markets contain above-average population and income
demographics for new self-storage properties. The clustering of assets
around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs
through economies of scale. The Storage USA acquisition has given us an
increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets
where we had no previous presence.

We consider a property to be in the lease-up stage
after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved
stabilization. We consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved
either an 80% occupancy rate or has been open for three years.

As of December 31, 2006, greater than 100,000
tenants were leasing storage units at our 219 wholly-owned properties,
primarily on a month-to-month basis, providing the flexibility to increase
rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Although leases are
short-term in duration, the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties
for an extended period of time. For properties that were stabilized as of December 31,
2006, the median length of stay was approximately eleven months.

Our property portfolio is a made up of different types
of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the
municipality where it is located. Most often sites are what we consider “hybrid”
facilities, a mix of both drive-up buildings and multi-floor
buildings. We have a number of multi-floor buildings with elevator access
only, and a number of facilities featuring ground-floor access only.

The following table sets
forth additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized
properties on a state-by-state basis as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The
information as of December 31, 2005 is on a pro forma basis as though all
the properties owned at December 31, 2006 were under our control as of December 31,
2005.

Item 7.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this
report. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete
discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Form 10-K
entitled “Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information.” Certain risk
factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ
materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a
discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Form 10-K
entitled “Risk Factors.”

Overview

We are a fully integrated, self-administered and
self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, formed to continue the
business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own, operate,
acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties.
Since 1996, our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have
completed the development or acquisition of more than 600 self-storage
properties.

In July 2005, we, along with joint-venture
partner Prudential Real Estate Investors (“PREI”), acquired Storage USA (“SUSA”)
from GE Commercial Finance for approximately $2.3 billion in cash. The
transaction made us the second largest operator of self-storage facilities in
the United States. At December 31, 2006, we owned or managed 641
properties in 32 states and Washington, D.C. As of December 31, 2006, 219
of our properties were wholly-owned, we held joint venture interests in 348
properties, and our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc.,
operated an additional 74 properties that are owned by franchisees or third
parties in exchange for a management fee. The properties that we own or in
which we hold an ownership interest contain approximately 41 million
square feet of rentable space contained in approximately 380,000 units and
currently serve a customer base of greater than 280,000 tenants.

Our properties are generally situated in convenient,
highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as
Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los
Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St.
Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco. These areas all enjoy above average
population growth and income levels. The clustering of our assets around these
population centers, which has intensified following the SUSA acquisition,
enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. We
consider a property to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a
certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. A property
is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80% occupancy rate or
has been open for three years.

The SUSA acquisition gave us a national platform upon
which to leverage operational, advertising and other economic efficiencies. The
acquisition also created a built-in acquisition pipeline through various joint-venture,
franchise and third-party management partners from which we have grown
and can continue to grow in the future. We also retained several key executives
from the SUSA organization, as well as the majority of its field operations
team.

To maximize the performance of our properties, we
employ a state-of-the-art, proprietary, web-based tracking and yield management
technology called STORE. Developed by our management team, STORE enables us to
analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order
to respond to changing market conditions. As part of the SUSA acquisition, we
gained access to SUSA’s industry leading revenue management team (“RevMan”),
which managed SUSA’s rental rate and discount strategies. We believe that the
combination of STORE’s yield management capabilities and the systematic
processes developed by RevMan has allowed us to more proactively manage
revenue.


We derive substantially all of our revenues from rents
received from tenants under existing leases at each of our self-storage
properties and from management fees on the properties we manage for joint-venture
partners, franchisees and unaffiliated third parties. This management fee is
equal to approximately 6% of total revenues generated by the managed
properties.

We operate in competitive markets, often where
consumers have multiple self-storage properties from which to choose.
Competition has impacted, and will continue to impact our property results. We
experience minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy
levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity.
Our operating results, therefore, depend materially on our ability to lease
available self-storage units, to actively manage unit rental rates, and on the
ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that we are
able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and
national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of
STORE, and through the use of the processes developed by RevMan.

We continue to
evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to
enable us to maximize stockholder value. Our strategies to maximize stockholder
value include:

·

Maximize the
performance of properties through strategic, efficient and proactive
management.

We plan to pursue revenue generating and expense
minimizing opportunities in our operations. Our revenue management team will
seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through
STORE’s ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount
management. Our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our
competitors to implement national, regional and local marketing programs, which
we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.

·

Focus on the
acquisition of self-storage properties from strategic partners and third
parties.

Our acquisitions team will continue to pursue the
acquisition of single properties and multi-property portfolios that we believe
can provide stockholder value. Our July 2005 acquisition of Storage USA
has bolstered our reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe
enhances our ability to negotiate and close non-brokered, private deals. In
addition, our status as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust
enables flexibility when structuring deals.

·

Develop new
self-storage properties.

We have several joint venture and
wholly-owned development properties and will continue to develop new
self-storage properties in our core markets. Our development pipeline through
2009 includes 27 projects. The majority of the projects will be developed on a
wholly-owned basis by the Company.

·

Expand the Company’s
management business.

We see the management business as a future
acquisition pipeline and expect to pursue strategic relationships with owners
that should strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give
us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a
potential sale. Twelve of our 2006 acquisitions came from this channel.

During 2006 we acquired 25 wholly-owned
properties and minority equity interests in one additional property. We
completed the development of eleven properties in our core markets and four
expansions of wholly-owned properties. Of the properties completed, three
are wholly-owned, two are owned by us in a joint venture, and the other six
properties are owned by Extra Space Development, an entity in which we do not
have any ownership interest, but which is owned by certain members of senior
management. These joint venture and third party development properties provide
us with a potential acquisition pipeline in the future. Four properties are
scheduled for completion in 2007, three of which are wholly-owned and one of
which will be owned by us in a joint venture.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and
assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies.
We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various
other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most
critical accounting policies:

CONSOLIDATION:

We
follow FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” (“FIN 46R”), which addresses the consolidation of variable
interest entities (“VIEs”). Under FIN 46R, arrangements that are not
controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as VIEs. An
enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of
the VIE.

Under FIN 46R, a VIE is created when (i) the
equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other
parties, or (ii) the entity’s equity holders as a group either: (a) lack
direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or
similar rights, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the
entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected
residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an entity is deemed to be a
VIE pursuant to FIN 46R, the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a
majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual
returns of the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate
the VIE.

Based on the provisions of FIN 46R, we have
concluded that under certain circumstances when we (i) enter into option
agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a
non-refundable deposit, or (ii) enter into arrangements for the formation
of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (ii) (b) or (c) of
the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, we have considered expected
losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as
outlined in FIN 46R. If we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of
the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated
with our financial statements.

REAL
ESTATE ASSETS:

Real estate assets are stated at
cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs
associated with the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of
real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs
associated with development incurred during the construction period are
capitalized.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or
extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their
estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are
generally between five and 39 years.

In connection with our acquisition of properties, the
purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and
liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. The value of the
tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, are determined as if vacant,
that is, at replacement cost. Intangible assets, which represent the value of
existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their estimated fair values. We
measure the value of tenant relationships based on our historical experience
with turnover in our facilities. We amortize to expense the tenant
relationships on a straight-line basis over the average period that a tenant is
expected to utilize the facility (currently estimated to be 18 months).

Intangible lease rights represent purchase price
amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as
ground or building leases. These rights are amortized to expense over the life
of the leases.


EVALUATION
OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT:

We evaluate long-lived
assets which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances
indicate that there may be an impairment. If such events occur, we compare the
carrying value of these long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating
cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the
net carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating
cash flows attributable to the asset. The impairment loss recognized equals the
excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset.

When real estate assets are identified by management
as held for sale, we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair
value, net of selling costs. If the estimated fair value, net of selling costs,
of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying
value of the assets, then a valuation allowance is established. The operations
of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as discontinued
operations for all periods presented.

INVESTMENTS
IN REAL ESTATE VENTURES:

Our investments in real
estate joint ventures, where we have significant influence, but not control and
joint ventures which are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary are
recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

Under the equity method, our investment in real estate
ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses
and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is
generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of
the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the purposes of presentation in
the statement of cash flows, we follow the “look through” approach for
classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach,
distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and
circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return
of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from
the joint venture’s sale of assets) in which case it is reported as an
investing activity.

Our management assesses whether there are any
indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate
ventures may be impaired when events or circumstances indicate that there may
be an impairment. An investment is impaired if management’s estimate of the
fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent
impairment has occurred, and it is considered to be other than temporary, the
loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over
the fair value of the investment.

DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:

Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
hedging activities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an
asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, are
considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted
transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges,
changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the
hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is
initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss), outside of earnings
and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects
earnings.

CONVERSION
OF OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS:

Conversions of
Operating Partnership units to common stock, when converted under the original
provisions of the agreement, are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying
net book value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance


with Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 95-7, “Implementation Issues Related to the
Treatment of Minority Interest in Certain Real Estate Investment Trusts.”

REVENUE
AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION:

Rental revenues are
recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants.
Leases are generally on month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are
recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period. Late
charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck rentals are
recognized in income when earned. Management and franchise fee revenue are
recognized when earned. Tenant insurance premiums are recognized as revenue
over the period of insurance coverage. Development and acquisition fee revenue
is recognized as development costs are incurred. Equity in earnings of real
estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings
of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. Interest income is
recognized as earned.

Property expenses, including utilities, property
taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are
recognized as incurred. We accrue for property tax expense based upon estimates
and historical trends. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense
recognition could be affected.

REAL
ESTATE SALES:

We evaluate real estate sales for
both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” In general, sales
of real estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration
has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related
profit recognition; other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale
recognition but require deferral of profit recognition.

INCOME
TAXES:

We have elected to be treated as a REIT
under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to
maintain our qualification as a REIT, among other things, we are required to
distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders and meet
certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets. As a REIT, we are
not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income
which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders.
We plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as
a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex.
If we were to fail to meet these requirements, we would be subject to federal
income tax. We are subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such
taxes has been included in property operating expenses in our consolidated
statement of operations.

We have elected to treat one of our corporate
subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). In general, our TRS may
perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real
estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or
management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to
any person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, of rights to any brand
name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A
TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax.

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION:

Effective January 1, 2006, we
adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (“SFAS 123R”),
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair
values. SFAS 123R supersedes SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”). We adopted SFAS 123R using the
modified prospective application method of adoption which requires us to record
compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards as of December 31,
2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over
their remaining service period with no change in historical reported earnings.
Awards granted after December 31, 2005 are valued at fair value in
accordance with provisions of SFAS 123R and recognized on a straight line basis
over the service periods of each award.

Property
Rental—

The

increase in property rental
revenues consists of $30,481 associated with the acquisition of 61 wholly-owned
properties in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition in July 2005, $12,170
associated with other acquisitions, and $1,922 from increases in occupancy at
lease-up properties. The remainder of the increase was due to increases in
rental rates at our stabilized properties.

Management
and Franchise Fees—

Our

taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra
Space Management, Inc., manages properties owned by our joint venture
franchisees and third parties. Management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash
collected from properties owned by third party franchisees and unconsolidated
joint ventures. The increase in management fees is due mainly to fees
associated with the SUSA acquisition which occurred in July 2005. Through
this acquisition we obtained equity interests in joint ventures which owned
over 330 properties. We obtained management contracts for these new joint
venture properties, and also obtained over 50 new third party and franchise
management contracts in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition.

Tenant
Insurance—

Tenant

insurance revenue relates
to a new tenant insurance program adopted in July 2005. This program was
started in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition to replace SUSA’s tenant
insurance program. Insurance revenues are higher in 2006 as the program was in
place for a full year in 2006 compared to a partial year in 2005.

Acquisition
and Development Fees—

The

decrease in acquisition and
development fee revenue was due to the decreased volume of development relating
to joint ventures in 2006 compared to prior years.

Property
Operations—

The

increase in property
operations expense in 2006 was primarily due to increases of $10,560 associated
with the SUSA acquisition in July 2005 and $4,664 related to the 25
properties acquired throughout 2006 and other properties acquired in 2005.
There were also increases in expenses of $1,056 at existing properties
primarily due to increases in utilities, repairs and maintenance and property
taxes.

Tenant
Insurance—

Tenant

insurance expense for 2006
relates to a new tenant insurance program adopted in July 2005. This
program was started in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition to replace SUSA’s
tenant insurance program. Tenant insurance expense is higher in 2006 as the
tenant insurance program was in place for a full year in 2006, compared to a
partial year in 2005.

General
and Administrative—

The

significant increase in
general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the increased costs
associated with the management of the additional properties that have been
added through acquisitions and new joint venture arrangements entered into in
2005 and 2006.

Depreciation and
Amortization—

The

increase in depreciation and
amortization expense is a result of additional properties acquired from the
SUSA acquisition and other acquisitions completed throughout 2005 and 2006.

Interest
Expense—

The

increase in interest expense
for the year ended December 31, 2006 was due primarily to $9,469 of
interest expense on the mortgage loans on the 61 properties acquired in
connection with the SUSA acquisition. The increase was offset by lower interest
costs on corporate borrowings and existing property debt. Capitalized interest
during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $3,232 and $459,
respectively.

Interest
Income—

Interest

income earned in 2006 was
mainly the result of the interest earned on the gross proceeds of $205,275
received from the sale of stock. The interest income earned in 2005 was


primarily earned on the
notes receivable that were obtained as part of the SUSA acquisition. These
notes receivable were paid down to $0 as of December 31, 2006.

Minority
Interest—Operating Partnership—

Income

allocated to
the Operating Partnership represents 6.21% of the net income for the year ended
December 31, 2006. The amount allocated to minority interest was higher
than in the prior year due mainly to the fact that the Company recorded net
income in 2006, and recored a net loss in 2005.

Equity in Earnings of Real
Estate Ventures—

The

increase in equity in earnings
of real estate ventures is due primarily to our purchase of new equity
interests in joint ventures in July 2005.

Comparison of the
Year Ended December 31, 2005 to the Year Ended December 31, 2004

In the Results of
Operations discussion below, we will compare the results of our operations for
the year ended December 31, 2005 with historical results of operations for
the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2004 through August 16,
2004 and with our historical results of operations for the period from August 17,
2004 through December 31, 2004. Comparisons to any prior periods are to
the historical results of the operations of the Predecessor.

Overview

Results for the year ended
December 31, 2005 included the operations of 546 properties (192 of which
were consolidated and 354 of which were in joint ventures accounted for using
the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended December 31,
2004, which included operations of 147 properties, seven of which were
deconsolidated during 2004 (128 of which were consolidated and 19 of which were
in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method). Results for the year
ended December 31, 2004 include the results of six properties in which we
did not own any interest and one where we sold our joint venture interest in
2004. These six properties were consolidated as a result of guarantees and/or
puts for which we were liable. Five of the six properties were deconsolidated
on August 16, 2004 upon the release of all guarantees and puts, and the
other property was deconsolidated on December 31, 2004. Results for both
periods also included equity in earnings of real estate ventures, third-party
management and franchise fees, acquisition fees and development fees.

Property
Rental—

The

increase in property rental
revenues consists of $24,703 associated with the acquisition of 61 wholly-owned
properties in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition in July 2005, $23,827
associated with other acquisitions, $6,953 from the buyout of certain joint
venture interests previously accounted for using the equity method of
accounting, and $2,880 from increases in occupancy at lease-up properties.
These increases were offset by a decrease of $379 due primarily to the
deconsolidation of certain properties in 2004.


Management
and Franchise Fees—

Our

taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra
Space Management, Inc., manages properties owned by our joint ventures and
third parties. Management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash collected from
properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. The
increase in management fees is due mainly to new fees associated with the SUSA
acquisition which occurred in July 2005. Through this acquisition we
obtained equity interests in joint ventures which own a total of 336 properties.
We obtained management contracts for these new joint venture properties, and
also obtained over 50 new third party and franchise management contracts in
conjunction with the SUSA acquisition.

Tenant
Insurance—

Tenant

insurance revenue relates
to a new tenant insurance program adopted in 2005. This program was started in
conjunction with the SUSA acquisition to replace SUSA’s tenant insurance
program.

Acquisition
and Development Fees—

The

decrease in acquisition and
development fee revenue was due to the decreased volume of development relating
to joint ventures in 2005 compared to prior years.

Other Income—

Other

income
represents primarily income from truck rentals. The increase in other income is
associated with the SUSA acquisition and other acquisitions made in 2005.

Property
Operations—

The

increase in property
operations expense in 2005 was primarily due to increases of $9,045 associated
with the SUSA acquisition, $8,852 associated with other acquisitions, and
$1,873 from the buyout of certain joint venture interests (previously accounted
for using the equity method of accounting). There were also increases in
expenses of $733 at existing properties due to increases in utilities, repairs
and maintenance and property taxes, which was partially offset by the decrease
of $606 of property operating expenses due to the deconsolidation of certain
properties in 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we and the
Predecessor opened five new properties and acquired 44 new properties. During
the year ended December 31, 2005, we acquired 61 properties in connection
with the SUSA acquisition, and nine properties in other acquisitions.

Tenant
Insurance—

Tenant

insurance expense for 2005
relates to a new tenant insurance program adopted in 2005. This program was
started in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition to replace SUSA’s tenant
insurance program.

Unrecovered
Development and Acquisition Costs—

Unrecovered

development
costs for 2005 decreased when compared to 2004 due to lower level of development
activity.

General
and Administrative—

The

significant increase in
general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31,
2005 was due mainly to the increased costs associated with the management of
the additional properties that have been added through acquisitions and new
joint venture arrangements entered into during 2005. We incurred approximately
$1,500 of additional general and administrative


expenses during 2005
relating to the integration of the SUSA properties and administrative systems
and $601 of amortization of deferred compensation expense related to stock
grants.

Depreciation and
Amortization—

The

increase in depreciation and
amortization expense results from more properties being open during the year
ended December 31, 2005 than were open during the year ended December 31,
2004 due mainly to acquisitions of new properties. We acquired 70 properties
during 2005, 61 of which were acquired in connection with the SUSA acquisition.

Interest
Expense and Loss on Debt Extinguishments—

The

increase in
interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was due primarily to
$4,312 of interest incurred on the new trust preferred debt and $7,977 of
interest expense on the mortgage loans on the 61 properties acquired in
connection with the SUSA acquisition. The remainder of the increase was due
mainly to other new loans obtained in 2005 related to the SUSA acquisition and
other acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2004, there was
$3,523 paid to extinguish debt. There was no debt extinguishment expense in
2005. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004 was $459 and $1,213, respectively. During 2005, we acquired 70 new
properties, which increased outstanding debt by $206,198 as of December 31,
2005.

Interest
Income—

The

significant increase in
interest income for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the
prior year was mainly the result of the interest earned on the $37,667 of notes
receivable that we acquired in connection with the SUSA acquisition. These
notes receivable were paid down to $12,109 by December 31, 2005.

Minority
interest—Fidelity Preferred Return—

Minority

interest—Fidelity
preferred return was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2005 as the Fidelity
minority interest was redeemed September 9, 2004.

Minority
Interest—Operating Partnership—

Loss

allocated to
the Operating Partnership represents 8.04% of the net loss for the year ended December 31,
2005. The amount allocated to minority interest was higher than in the prior
year due mainly to the fact that the Operating Partnership was in place for a
full year in 2005, compared to only the period subsequent to the IPO in 2004.

Loss
Allocated to Other Minority Interests—

There

were no losses
allocated to other minority interests during the year ended December 31,
2005 because we redeemed or deconsolidated all other minority interests in
operating properties during the year ended December 31, 2004. The only
other minority interest in place as of December 31, 2005 is an interest in
a development property which has not yet begun operations.


Equity
in Earnings of Real Estate Ventures—

The

increase in
equity in earnings of real estate ventures is due primarily to our purchase of
new equity interests in joint ventures. As a result of the SUSA acquisition we
own joint venture interests in an additional 336 new properties.

Gain on Sale of Real
Estate Assets—

The

gain on sale of real estate
assets was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2005 as there were no significant
gains on the sale of assets during 2005. The gain on sale of real estate assets
for the year ended December 31, 2004 was due primarily to a gain of $1,920
on the sale of our joint venture interest in a property in Laguna Hills,
California in August 2004.

FUNDS FROM
OPERATIONS

FFO provides relevant and meaningful information about
our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income (loss) and
cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. We believe FFO is a
meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings because net earnings
assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as
reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. We believe that the
values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and FFO more
accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets. FFO is defined by the
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (“NAREIT”) as
net income (loss) computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating
properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe
that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with
the reported net income (loss) and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as
presented in the consolidated financial statements.

The
computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real
estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current
NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently.
FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in
accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net
income (loss) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net
cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, or as an
indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. The following table sets
forth the calculation of FFO (dollars are in thousands, except for share data):

Comparison of the
Year Ended December 31, 2006 to the Year Ended December 31, 2005

The increase in same-store
rental revenues was primarily due to increased rental rates to new and existing
tenants and our ability to maintain occupancy. The increase in same-store
operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in property taxes and
utilities.

Comparison of the
Year Ended December 31, 2005 to the Year Ended December 31, 2004

operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance,
snow removal and property taxes.


CCS and CCU
Property Performance:

As
described in our prospectus for our IPO, upon the achievement of certain levels
of net operating income with respect to 14 of our pre-stabilized properties,
our CCSs and our Operating Partnership’s CCUs will convert into additional
shares of common stock and OP units, respectively, beginning with the quarter
ending March 31, 2006. No CCSs or CCUs have been converted as of December 31,

CASH FLOWS

Comparison of the
Year Ended December 31, 2006 to the Year Ended December 31, 2005

Cash flows provided by operating activities were
$74,520 and $14,771 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to
the addition of new stabilized properties including properties added as a
result of the SUSA acquisition. In addition, the increase was also a result of
the collection of receivables from affiliated joint ventures and related
parties as a result of normal operations.

Cash used in investing activities was $239,778 and
$614,834 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
decrease in 2006 is primarily the result of the $530,972 of cash paid in the
acquisition of Storage USA in 2005 offset by the increase in the acquisition of
other real estate assets in 2006 versus 2005.

Cash provided by financing
activities was $207,406 and $604,387 for the years ended December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively. The decrease consisted primarily of additional
borrowings in 2006 of $165,666 versus $808,936 in 2005, and net proceeds from
share issuances of $197,474 in 2006 versus $271,537 in 2005. This was offset by
repayments on borrowings of $98,866 in 2006, compared to $431,255 in 2005. In
addition, the Company also paid $50,005 in dividends to common stockholders in
2006, compared to $34,585 in 2005.


Comparison of the
Year Ended December 31, 2005 to the Year Ended December 31, 2004

Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities
were $14,771 and ($6,158) for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to
the addition of new stabilized properties through the SUSA acquisition and
other acquisitions. There have also been lower cash funding requirements
relating to our lease-up properties as occupancy has increased.

Cash used in investing activities was ($614,834) and
($261,298) for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The increase in 2005 is primarily the result of the $530,972 of cash paid in
the acquisition of Storage USA. This increase was offset by the fact that we
acquired fewer other properties and had fewer development projects during 2005
compared to 2004. We also received principal payments of $25,938 related to the
notes receivable acquired in conjunction with the SUSA transaction during 2005.

Cash provided by financing
activities was $604,387 and $280,039 for the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. The 2005 financing activities consisted primarily of
net proceeds from share issuances of $271,537, additional borrowings of
$808,936, including borrowings to fund the SUSA acquisition, offset by the
repayment of $431,255 of line of credit and notes payable. The 2004 financial
activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from share issuances of
$264,475, additional borrowings of $418,154, including borrowings to fund the
purchase of 44 stabilized properties and the development of existing projects,
offset by the repayment of $325,917 of borrowings.

2006 OPERATIONAL
SUMMARY

Our 2006 operating results reflected a continuation of
solid self-storage fundamentals as well as positive operational momentum. Our
acquisition of Storage USA and the integration of its business processes had a
positive impact on our results, particularly in the areas of revenue management
and technology. Revenue increases in 2006 were driven mostly by rate growth, as
year-end same-store occupancy was 85.5% compared with 85.4% as of year-end
2005. Expense growth was driven by property taxes, utility costs and normal
increases in employee-related expenses. Snow removal expenses, which adversely
affected our 2005 results were less of an impact during 2006 due to the
decreased snowfall in the Midwest and Northeastern United States.

Northern California, Phoenix and South Florida were
our strongest performing markets. Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Houston also
performed well. Weaker performing markets were Detroit, Philadelphia and
Southern New Jersey. Southern California, which has been a leading market for
several years, softened somewhat and performed in-line with the portfolio
average.

Integration efforts
arising from the SUSA acquisition continued throughout the year, and focused on
the capital improvement of the SUSA properties. These improvements, we believe,
will have a positive effect on the properties in the future by making them more
marketable to new and existing customers. The majority of the work was
completed during 2006, and a residual number of projects will continue into
2007. We consider the integration of the two companies now complete. The
benefits of scale from being the second largest operator of self-storage in the
United States began to be felt in the areas of marketing and site management.

OUTLOOK

We anticipate continued strength in self-storage
fundamentals due to positive overall economic conditions in many of our core
markets. We believe that the ability to increase revenues in 2007 over levels
achieved in 2006 exists. We anticipate continued competition from all
operators, both public and private, in all of the markets in which we operate.
However, we believe that the quality and location of our property portfolio,
our revenue management systems, and the strength of self-storage fundamentals
will provide opportunities to grow revenues in 2007.


Our discounting strategies continue to evolve. Higher
levels of discounting were felt in 2006 due to several promotional tests
executed throughout the year. We will continue to selectively discount certain
sites and units based on occupancy, availability, and competitive parameters
that are controlled through our centralized, real-time technology systems and
revenue management team.

Property taxes and utility
expenses are once again seen as the primary drivers of expenses in the coming
year. As we continue to acquire existing self-storage facilities, tax
reassessments will continue to occur. Snow removal may also contribute to a
higher level of expenses.

LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately
$70.8 million available in cash and cash equivalents. We intend to use this
cash to purchase additional self-storage properties in the first two quarters
of 2007. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income,
excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain
our qualification as a REIT. Therefore, it is unlikely that we will have any
substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs.
Instead, these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and
external sources of capital.

On September 9, 2004, we, as guarantor, and our
Operating Partnership entered into a $100.0 million revolving line of
credit (“Credit Facility”), which includes a $10.0 million swingline
sub-facility. The Credit Facility is collateralized by self-storage properties.
The Operating Partnership intends to use the proceeds of the Credit Facility
for general corporate purposes and acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006,
the Credit Facility had approximately $81.0 million of available capacity
based on the assets collateralizing the Credit Facility. There was no principal
balance outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2006.

On October 4, 2004, we entered into a reverse
interest rate swap with U.S. Bank National Association, relating to our
existing $61.8 million fixed rate mortgage with Wachovia Bank, which is due in
2009. Pursuant to the swap agreement, we will receive fixed interest payments
of 4.3% and pay variable interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR plus
0.7% on a notional amount of $61.8 million. There were no origination fees or
other up front costs incurred by us in connection with the swap agreement.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately
$948.2 million of debt, resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio
of 43.3%. As of December 31, 2006, the ratio of total fixed rate debt and
other instruments to total debt was 91.0%. The weighted average interest rate
of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at December 31, 2006 was
5.5%.

We expect to fund our
short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring
capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of OP
units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash
flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Facility.

Long-Term Liquidity
Needs

Our long-term liquidity
needs consist primarily of distributions to stockholders, new facility
development, property acquisitions, principal payments under our borrowings and
non-recurring capital expenditures. We do not expect that our operating cash
flow will be sufficient to fund our long term liquidity needs and instead
expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings, joint ventures with
third parties, and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity
and debt. We may also use OP Units as currency to fund acquisitions from
self-storage owners who desire tax-deferral in their exiting transactions.


OFF-BALANCE SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS

Except as disclosed in the
notes to our financial statements, we do not currently have any relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often
referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically
are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements
or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed
in the notes to our financial statements, we have not guaranteed any
obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent
to provide funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we are not materially
exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if
we had engaged in these relationships.

FINANCING STRATEGY

We will continue to
employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to
time by our board of directors. Although our board of directors has not adopted
a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we
will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from
time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either
fixed or variable rate. In making financing decisions, our board of directors
will consider factors including but not limited to:

·

the
interest rate of the proposed financing;

·

the
extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties;

·

prepayment
penalties and restrictions on refinancing;

·

the
purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing;

·

long-term
objectives with respect to the financing;

·

target
investment returns;

·

the
ability of particular properties, and the Company as a whole, to generate cash
flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments;

·

overall
level of consolidated indebtedness;

·

timing
of debt and lease maturities;

·

provisions
that require recourse and cross-collateralization;


·

corporate
credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total capitalization and
debt to undepreciated assets; and

·

the
overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt.

Our indebtedness may be
recourse, non-recourse or cross-collateralized. If the indebtedness is
non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to
which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in properties
subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our
properties, or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. We may
use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to
refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing properties, for
general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or
joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable.

SEASONALITY

The self-storage business
is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits
are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level
of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy
has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter may not
be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

RECENT ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2006, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial
statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the
related de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for
interim periods, disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions. FIN 48
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with the
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an
adjustment to opening retained earnings. We have evaluated the impact of this
new pronouncement and anticipate that there will be no material effect on our
consolidated financial statements.

Item 7a.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

Market risk refers to the
risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our
future income, cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are
dependent upon prevailing market interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many
factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and
international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond
our control.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately
$948.2 million in total debt of which $85.1 million was subject to
variable interest rates (including the $61.8 million on which we have the
reverse interest rate swap). If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis
points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt
would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $0.9
million annually.

Interest rate risk amounts were determined by
considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial
instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall
economic


activity that could occur.
Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to
further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of
the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these
analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.

The fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes
payable to trusts at December 31, 2006 was $835,667. The carrying value of
these fixed rate notes payable at December 31, 2006 was $863,101.

Extra Space Storage Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2006

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)

1.

DESCRIPTION OF
BUSINESS

Business

Extra Space Storage Inc. (the “Company”) is a
self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”),
formed as a Maryland Corporation on April 30, 2004 to own, operate,
manage, acquire and develop self-storage facilities located throughout the
United States. The Company continues the business of Extra Space Storage LLC
and its subsidiaries (the “Predecessor”), which had engaged in the self-storage
business since 1977. The Company’s interest in its properties is held through
its operating partnership, Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating Partnership”),
which was formed on May 5, 2004. The Company’s primary assets are general
partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This
structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT.
The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). To the extent the Company
continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be subject to tax, with certain
limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to its
stockholders.

The Company invests in self-storage facilities by
acquiring or developing wholly-owned facilities or by acquiring an equity
interest in real estate entities. At December 31, 2006, the Company had
direct and indirect equity interests in 567 storage facilities located in 32
states, and Washington, D.C. In addition, the Company managed 74 properties for
franchisees or third parties bringing the total number of properties which it
owns and/or manages to 641.

The Company operates in
two distinct segments: (1) property management and development; and (2) rental
operations. The Company’s property management and development activities
include acquiring, managing, developing and selling self-storage facilities.
The rental operations activities include rental operations of self-storage
facilities. No single tenant accounts for more than 5% of rental income.

Initial Public
Offering

On August 17, 2004, the Company completed its
initial public offering (the “Offering”) of 20,200,000 shares of common stock,
with proceeds to the Company of $234,825, net of offering costs of $17,675. As
part of the offering, the Company granted the underwriters the right to
purchase an additional 3,030,000 shares within 30 days after the Offering
to cover over-allotments. On September 1, 2004, the underwriters exercised
their right and purchased 3,030,000 shares of common stock with proceeds to the
Company of $35,224, net of offering costs of $2,651. The Company also paid
additional offering costs of $5,574 as part of the Offering.

In connection with the
Offering, the existing holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class E
Units in the Predecessor exchanged these units for an aggregate of 7,939,950
shares of common stock, 1,608,437 Operating Partnership (“OP”) units, 3,888,843
contingent conversion shares (“CCSs”), 200,046 contingent conversion units (“CCUs”)
and $18,885 in cash. As a result of this exchange, the Predecessor became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31,
2006, the Operating Partnership was a 94.40% subsidiary of the Company. The
transaction did not result in a change in the carrying value of the Predecessor’s
assets and liabilities because the exchange was accounted for at historical
cost as a transfer of assets between companies under common control.


2.

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
results of operations of the Predecessor for the period from January 1,
2004 through August 16, 2004 and the results of operations and financial
condition of the Company subsequent to the Offering.

The consolidated financial statements are presented on
the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly or
majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company follows FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46R”), which addresses the consolidation
of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Under FIN 46R, arrangements that are
not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as VIEs. An
enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of
the VIE.

Under FIN 46R, a VIE is created when (i) the
equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other
parties, or (ii) the entity’s equity holders as a group either: (a) lack
direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or
similar rights, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the
entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected
residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an entity is deemed to be a
VIE pursuant to FIN 46R, the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of
the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of the
VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.

Based on the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company has
concluded that under certain circumstances when the Company (i) enters
into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and
pays a non-refundable deposit, or (ii) enters into arrangements for the
formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (ii) (b) or
(c) of the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, the Company has
considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of
future cash flows as outlined in FIN 46R. If the Company is determined to be
the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of
the VIE are consolidated with the Company’s financial statements.

The Company’s investments
in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but
not control and joint ventures which are VIEs in which the Company is not the
primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Real Estate Assets

Real estate assets are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated with
the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate
assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated
with development incurred during the


construction period are
capitalized. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 was $3,232, $460, and $1,213, respectively.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or
extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their
estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are
generally between five and 39 years.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of
properties, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible
assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. The value
of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, are determined as if
vacant, that is, at replacement cost. Intangible assets, which represent the
value of existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their estimated fair
values. The Company measures the value of tenant relationships based on the
Company’s historical experience with turnover in its facilities. The Company
amortizes to expense the tenant relationships on a straight-line basis over the
average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility (currently
estimated to be 18 months).

Intangible lease rights
represent purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that
cannot be classified as ground or building leases. These rights are amortized
to expense over the life of the leases.

Evaluation of Asset
Impairment

Long lived assets held for use are evaluated by the
Company for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be
an impairment. When such an event occurs, the Company compares the carrying
value of these long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash
flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net
carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash
flows attributable to the asset. The impairment loss recognized equals the
excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset.
Management has determined no property was impaired and no impairment charges
have been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004.

When real estate assets
are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues
depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value, net of selling costs. If
the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been
identified for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, then a
valuation allowance is established. The operations of assets held for sale or
sold during the period are presented as discontinued operations for all periods
presented. Management has determined no property was held for sale at December 31,
2006.

Investments in Real
Estate Ventures

The Company’s investments in real estate joint
ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control and
joint ventures which are VIEs in which the Company is not the primary
beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Under the equity method, the Company’s investment in
real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for the Company’s share of
net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real
estate ventures is generally recognized based on the Company’s ownership
interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures.
For the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows, the Company
follows the “look through” approach for classification of distributions from
joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported under operating
cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly
indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating


dividend or distribution
of the proceeds from the joint venture’s sale of assets) in which case it is
reported as an investing activity.

Management assesses
whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company’s investments in
unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired when events or
circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment. An investment is
impaired if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less
than its carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred, and is
considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of
the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. No
impairment charges were recognized for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

The Company’s cash is
deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States of
America and at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company considers
all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash is
comprised of escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions located in
various states relating to earnest money deposits on potential acquisitions,
real estate taxes, insurance, capital expenditures and lease liabilities.

Other Assets

Other assets consist
primarily of equipment and fixtures, deferred financing costs, customer
accounts receivable, investments in trusts, and prepaid expenses. Depreciation
of equipment and fixtures is computed on a straight-line basis over three to
seven years. Deferred financing costs are amortized to interest expense
using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective debt
agreements.

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted, establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging
activities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends
on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an
asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, are
considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted
transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated
as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the
hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in the statements of
operations. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in
other comprehensive income (loss), outside of earnings and subsequently
reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.

Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The carrying values of
cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other financial instruments included in
other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, variable rate notes
payable and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2006 and 2005 approximate fair value. The fair value of fixed rate notes
payable and notes payable to trusts at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was


$835,667
and $750,527, respectively. The carrying value of these fixed rate notes
payable and notes payable to trusts at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was
$863,101 and $772,570, respectively.

Risk Management And
Use Of Financial Instruments

In the normal course of
its on-going business operations, the Company encounters economic risk. There
are three main components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and
market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its interest-bearing
liabilities. Credit risk is the risk of inability or unwillingness of tenants
to make contractually required payments. Market risk is the risk of declines in
the value of properties due to changes in rental rates, interest rates or other
market factors affecting the value of properties held by the Company. As
disclosed in Note 9, the Company has entered into a Swap Agreement to manage
its interest rate risk.

Conversion of
Operating Partnership Units

Conversions of Operating
Partnership units to common stock, when converted under the original provisions
of the agreement, are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book
value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-7, “Implementation Issues Related to
the Treatment of Minority Interest in Certain Real Estate Investment Trusts.”

Revenue and Expense
Recognition

Rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon
amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally on
month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis
over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are recognized as a
reduction to rental income over the promotional period. Late charges,
administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in
income when earned. Management and franchise fee revenue are recognized when
earned. Tenant insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of
insurance coverage. Development and acquisition fee revenue is recognized as
development costs are incurred. Equity in earnings of real estate entities is
recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the
unconsolidated real estate entities. Interest income is recognized as earned.

Property expenses,
including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to
manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. We accrue for property tax
expense based upon estimates and historical trends. If these estimates are
incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected.

Real Estate Sales

The Company evaluates real estate sales for both sale
recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66,
“Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” In general, sales of real estate and
related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands
and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Certain types of
continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition;
other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require
deferral of profit recognition.

The Predecessor
periodically sold properties into real estate joint ventures or identified
properties for acquisition by newly formed joint ventures in which it retained
an interest. In connection with certain of these transactions, the Predecessor
and/or a significant unit holder provided certain financial guarantees to the
lender; or to support a put right on a portion of the joint venture partner’s
interest that effectively provided for a return on and of their investment.
These arrangements preclude sale accounting under SFAS No. 66 and,
accordingly, the Predecessor has reflected these transactions using the
financing method set forth in SFAS No. 66. Under this method, the putable
portions of these joint ventures partners’


interests
are reflected as liabilities; the initial fair value of the joint venture
partners’ non-putable residual interests are reflected as minority interests
with offsetting discounts attributed to the liabilities associated with the
putable interests, “putable preferred interests in consolidated joint ventures.”
These discounts are amortized using the effective interest method over the
period until the relevant put first becomes exercisable (generally a period of
three to five years depending on the terms of the individual transaction).
The preferred return on the putable interest liabilities, plus the amortization
of the discounts, is reflected as interest expense in the consolidated
statements of operations. The joint venture partners are allocated their
proportionate share of any profits, except that losses may not be allocated in
excess of the originally ascribed basis. Concurrent with the Offering, the Company
redeemed all putable interest liabilities by purchasing 100% of its partners’
interest in these properties.

Advertising Costs

The Company incurs
advertising costs primarily attributable to directory, direct mail, internet
and other advertising. Direct response advertising costs are deferred and
amortized over the expected benefit period determinded to be 12 months. All
other advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company recognized
$4,960, $4,374, and $2,950 in advertising expense for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”). In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, among other
things, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable
income to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its
income and assets. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax
with respect to that portion of its income which meets certain criteria and is
distributed annually to the stockholders. The Company plans to continue to
operate so that it meets the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these
requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If the Company were to
fail to meet these requirements, the Company would be subject to federal income
tax. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for
such taxes has been included in the Company’s property operations expense in
the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31,
2006, 58.4% (unaudited) of all distributions to stockholders qualify as a
return of capital.

The Company has elected to treat one of its existing corporate
subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). In general, a TRS of the
Company may perform additional services for tenants of the Company and
generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business
(except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging
facilities or the provision to any person, under a franchise, license or
otherwise, of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or
health care facility is operated). A TRS is subject to corporate federal income
tax.

The TRS has minimal book and tax income and has not
recorded tax amounts under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
due to the amounts not being material.

Prior to August 17,
2004, the Company elected to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes. The
tax effects of the Company’s operations were passed directly to members.
Therefore, no provisions for income taxes were recorded in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (“SFAS 123R”), which
requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair
values. SFAS 123R


supersedes SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”). The
Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application method of
adoption which requires the Company to record compensation cost related to
non-vested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the
unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over their remaining service
period with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December 31,
2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with provisions of SFAS 123R and
recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. The
forfeiture rate, which is estimated at a weighted average of 14.8% of unvested
options outstanding as of December 31, 2006, is adjusted periodically
based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to
differ, from the previous estimate.

Prior to 2006, the Company
accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB 25 using the
intrinsic value method, which did not require that compensation cost be
recognized for the Company’s stock options provided the option exercise price
was established at 100% of the common stock fair value on the date of grant.
Under APB 25, the Company was required to record expense over the vesting
period for the value of restricted common stock granted. Prior to 2006, the
Company provided pro forma disclosure amounts in accordance with SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS 148”),
as if the fair value method defined by SFAS 123 had been applied to its
stock-based compensation.

Net Income (Loss)
Per Share

Basic income (loss) per common share is computed by
dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average common shares
outstanding, less unvested restricted stock. Diluted income (loss) per common
share measures the performance of the Company over the reporting period while
giving effect to all potential common shares that were dilutive and outstanding
during the period. The denominator includes the number of additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares that
were dilutive had been issued and is calculated using the treasury stock
method. Potential common shares are securities (such as options, warrants,
convertible debt, and convertible OP units) that do not have a current right to
participate in income but could do so in the future by virtue of their option
or conversion right. In computing the dilutive effect of convertible
securities, the numerator (i.e. net income or loss) is adjusted to add back any
changes in income in the period associated with the convertible security. The
numerator also is adjusted for the effects of any other non-discretionary
changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of
those potential common shares. In computing diluted income (loss) per share,
only potential common shares that are dilutive, those that reduce income (loss)
per share, are included. Excluded from the December 31, 2006 computation
of diluted common shares outstanding are: 118,086 shares of restricted stock
grants, and 24,273 stock options as their impact was not dilutive.

For the periods prior to
the Offering, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding includes
Class A units as if the Class A units had been converted to common
stock using the initial public offering conversion ratio of one Class A
unit to 0.08 shares of common stock. Basic and diluted loss per share were
calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the
weighted average shares outstanding. The net loss attributable to common
stockholders represents the net loss, less the preferred return payable by the
Predecessor on Class B, C and E units, less the loss on early redemption
of Fidelity minority interest. The loss on early redemption of Fidelity
minority interest represents additional preferred return paid to Fidelity for
the period between the redemption date of September 9, 2004 and November 25,
2004. The amount was paid based on the agreement whereby Fidelity was entitled
to a preferred return through November 25, 2004, regardless of the redemption
date.


Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In June 2006, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial
statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the
related de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for
interim periods, disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with the
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an
adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company has evaluated the impact
of this new pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements and does not
expect the impact of FIN 48 to be material.

BUSINESS
ACQUISITION

To expand its business, on July 14, 2005, the
Company, through its subsidiary Extra Space Storage LLC (“ESS LLC”) and the
Operating Partnership, closed the acquisition (the “Transaction”) of various
entities that collectively comprise the Storage USA self-storage business
pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Agreement”), dated May 5,
2005, between ESS LLC, the Operating Partnership, Security Capital Self Storage
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, PRISA Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“PRISA”), PRISA II Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“PRISA II”), PRISA III Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“PRISA III”), VRS Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“VRS”), WCOT Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (“WCOT”), and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, a New Jersey
corporation (together with its affiliates, “Prudential”).

In connection with the Transaction, the Company
acquired 61 wholly-owned self storage properties, acquired Storage USA (“SUSA”)
Partnership, L.P.’s equity interest in joint ventures which collectively owned
78 properties and assumed the management of 60 franchises and third party owned
properties. In


addition, 259 self-storage
properties were acquired in the Transaction by five separate limited liability
companies owned by five subsidiaries of the Company (each, a “Company Sub”) and
Prudential. The limited liability company agreements govern the rights and
responsibilities of each such limited liability company. The Company also
acquired $37.7 million of notes receivable due from franchisees.

The
total purchase cost for SUSA of approximately $585.7 million consists of
the following:

The
total purchase price for the acquisition of SUSA has been allocated to tangible
and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The
value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, are determined
as if vacant, that is, at replacement cost. Other tangible assets and
liabilities and intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant
relationships, are recorded at their estimated fair value. The following table
summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed:

generated through operations or capital transactions, the Company would receive
a higher percentage of the excess cash/profits than its equity interest.

During the first and second quarter 2004, the
Predecessor held a minority investment in Extra Space East One LLC (“ESE”). The
Predecessor acquired its joint venture partner’s interest in ESE on May 4, 2004.

NOTES
RECEIVABLE

Notes receivable relate to construction advances SUSA
had offered to certain franchisees. The notes were collateralized by the
franchised properties and had terms up to five years. Interest payments
were generally due monthly on the notes during the first two years of the
term, with amortization of principal generally commencing in the third year
based upon a 25-year schedule with the balance due at the due date. The
loans bore interest based on a spread over the prime interest rate of 0.5% to
1.0%. Typically, advances represented 70% - 90% of the anticipated
cost of the project.

Management periodically
assessed historical payment history, payment status, prevailing economic and
business conditions, specific loan terms and other relevant factors to
determine whether any notes receivable should be placed on non-accrual status
or otherwise adjusted for impairment. At December 31, 2006, all of these
notes receivable had been repaid.

Real estate assets are pledged as collateral for the
notes payable. The Company is subject to certain restrictive covenants relating
to the outstanding notes payable. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants at December 31, 2006.

In October 2004, the Company entered into a
reverse interest rate swap agreement (“Swap Agreement”) to float $61,770 of
4.30% fixed interest rate secured notes due in June 2009. Under this Swap
Agreement, the Company will receive interest at a fixed rate of 4.30% and pay
interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.655%. The Swap Agreement
matures at the same time the notes are due. This Swap Agreement is a fair value
hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, and the fair value of the Swap
Agreement is recorded as an asset or liability, with an offsetting adjustment
to the carrying value of the related note payable. Monthly variable interest
payments are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest expense.

The estimated fair value
of the Swap Agreement at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was reflected as an
other liability of $1,925 and $2,151, respectively. For the year ended December 31,
2006 interest expense has been increased by $802 as a result of the Swap
Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2005, interest expense has
been reduced by $70 as a result of the Swap Agreement.

LINE
OF CREDIT

The Company, as guarantor, and its Operating
Partnership have entered into a $100.0 million revolving line of credit,
which includes a $10.0 million swingline sub-facility (the “Credit
Facility”).

The Credit Facility has an
interest rate of 175 basis points over LIBOR (7.10% and 6.14% at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively). The Operating Partnership intends to use the
proceeds of the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. As of December 31,
2006, the Credit Facility had approximately $81.0 million of capacity
based on the assets collateralizing the Credit Facility. The outstanding
principal balance on the line of credit at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was
$0. The maturity date on the line of credit is September 2007. The Credit
Facility is collateralized by mortgages on certain real estate assets.

PUTABLE
PREFERRED INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER MINORITY INTERESTS

On August 17, 2004, the Company purchased its
joint venture partner’s 49.5% interest in Extra Space Properties Three, LLC.
Prior to the purchase of its joint venture partner’s interest, the Predecessor
owned a 50.5% interest in Extra Space Properties Three, LLC. This arrangement
provided for a preferred return of 12% on certain capital provided by both the
Predecessor and the joint venture partner, and thereafter returns were split
based upon percentage residual interests.

The Company also purchased its joint venture partner’s
interests in 15 other self-storage facilities on August 17, 2004. The
Predecessor had entered into these joint venture agreements with other entities
controlled by Equibase Mini Warehouse. These arrangements provided for a
preferred return of either 10% or 12%, depending on the specific agreement, on
certain capital provided by the joint venture partner and thereafter returns
were split based on the indicated percentage interests (generally 40% to the
Predecessor and 60% to the investors).

Prior to the buyout of the Predecessor’s joint venture
partners (entities controlled by Equibase Mini Warehouse), the Predecessor
and/or a significant unit holder provided certain financial guarantees to the
secured lender (generally providing for performance under the loan, including
principal and interest payments), or to support a put right on a portion of the
joint venture partner’s interest after a fixed period (generally either three
or five years), that effectively provided for a return on and of the
preferred portion of their investment. In addition, after a fixed period
(generally either three or five years), the joint venture had the right to
redeem the preferred capital at an amount equal to its unreturned contribution
plus any accrued preferred return. Upon exercise of the put or call on the
preferred portion of their investment, the joint venture investors would
continue to hold their residual equity interests. As a result of the put rights
and guarantees, the Predecessor consolidated the properties and related debt
until the put rights and guarantees were satisfied or have expired. The
financial guarantees to the secured lender would generally expire upon satisfaction
of the related loan at maturity or refinancing. The put rights and related
guarantees had no stated maturity and would only expire upon exercise or
through redemption of the preferred interests through a capital event.

On August 17, 2004, the Company completed the
acquisition of joint venture interests held by Equibase Mini Warehouse and its
affiliates in seven joint ventures, which owned an aggregate of 30 self-storage
properties, for an aggregate of approximately $35,800 in cash and 114,928 OP
units issued by the Operating Partnership valued at $1,437.


Upon completion of the Offering, the Company was
released from all puts and guarantees relating to the remaining Equibase joint
ventures. These guarantees and puts were transferred to Extra Space Development
and a stockholder of the Company. Accordingly, these properties were
deconsolidated as of August 17, 2004. The operating results through August 16,
2004 relating to the properties that were deconsolidated are included in the
consolidated statements of operations.

During the year ended
December 31, 2004, the Company reflected interest expense on the putable
preferred interests of $4,227, including amortization of discounts ascribed at
issuance of $1,043. No interest expense related to putable preferred interests
was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2006 or 2005.

RELATED
PARTY AND AFFILIATED REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTIONS

The Company provides management and development
services for certain joint ventures, franchise, third party and other related
party properties. Management agreements provide generally for management fees
of 6% of gross rental revenues for the management of operations at the
self-storage facilities. The Company earns development fees of 4%-6% of
budgeted costs on developmental projects and acquisition fees of 1% of the
gross purchase price or the completed costs of development of acquired
properties. As discussed in Note 5, the Company has purchased self-storage
properties from related parties and affiliated entities.

During the year ended December 31, 2004,
management fee expense of $2,775 was recorded for services provided to support
the Company’s and the Predecessor’s self-storage facilities by Extra Space
Management, Inc. (“ESMI”), a corporation that shared common ownership with
the Predecessor, including stockholders who were officers of the Predecessor.
Under this agreement, ESMI provided employees who supported the operations of
existing self-storage facilities and the acquisition and development of new self-storage
facilities by the Predecessor. On March 31, 2004, the Predecessor
purchased all of the outstanding common stock of ESMI for its net book value of
$184. ESMI had equipment and fixtures of $256, other assets of $736 and
liabilities of $808.

Development fees receivable consist of amounts due for
development services from third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures.
Other receivables from properties consist of amounts due for expenses paid on
behalf of the properties that the Company manages and management fees.
Receivables from Prudential relating to SUSA acquisition represented amounts
receivable from Prudential for general and


administrative expenses,
severance paid, and lease expenses paid relating to the SUSA acquisition. The
Company believes that all of these related party and affiliated real estate
joint venture receivables are fully collectible. The Company does not have any
payables to related parties at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

On January 1, 2004, the Predecessor distributed
its equity ownership in Extra Space Development LLC (“ESD”), a consolidated
subsidiary, to its Class A members. ESD owned 13 early-stage development
properties, two parcels of undeveloped land, and a note receivable. The net
book value of the distributed properties and related liabilities was
approximately $15,000. The Predecessor retained a receivable of $6,212 from ESD
and recorded a net distribution of $9,000. In September 2004, ESD repaid
the amounts due the Company using funds obtained through new loans on
unencumbered properties. The Predecessor was required to continue consolidating
certain properties due to financial guarantees. Concurrent with the initial
public offering, the Company was released from all guarantees, and the
properties were deconsolidated as of August 16, 2004.

The Company has determined that it has a variable
interest in properties in which ESD owns or has an ownership interest. The Company
does not have an equity investment or interest, and it is not the primary
beneficiary. This variable interest is a result of management and development
contracts that are held by the Company. The variable interest is limited to the
management and development fees and there is not any additional loss that can
be attributed to the Company. The Company has determined that it is not the
primary beneficiary in these agreements. Accordingly, these properties have not
been consolidated subsequent to August 16, 2004.

On January 1, 2004,
the Predecessor distributed the $4,493 (including accrued interest of $438)
note receivable from Centershift, related party software service provider,
which is partially owned by a certain director and members of management of the
Company, to its Class A members. Effective January 1, 2004, the
Company entered into a license agreement with Centershift which secures a
perpetual right for continued use of STORE (the site management software used
at all sites operated by the Company) in all aspects of the Company’s property
acquisition, development, redevelopment and operational activities. During
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company paid
Centershift $824, $739 and $441, respectively, relating to the purchase of
software and to license agreements.

15.

MINORITY
INTEREST IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

The Company’s interest in its properties is held
through the Operating Partnership. ESS Holding Business Trust I, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, is the sole general partner of the Operating
Partnership. The Company through ESS Business Trust II, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, is also a limited partner of the Operating
Partnership. Between its general partner and limited partner interests, the
Company held a 94.40% majority ownership interest therein as of December 31,
2006. The remaining ownership interests in the Operating Partnership of 5.60%
are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating
Partnership, which include a director and officers of the Company. The Company
and Operating Partnership were formed to continue to operate and expand the
business of the Predecessor.

The minority interest in the Operating Partnership
represents OP units that are not owned by the Company. In conjunction with the
formation of the Company and as a result of subsequent acquisitions, certain
persons and entities contributing interests in properties to the Operating
Partnership received limited partnership units. Limited partners who received
OP units in the formation transactions have the right to require the Operating
Partnership to redeem part or all of their OP units for cash based upon the
fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at the time
of the redemption. Alternatively, the Company may, at its option, elect to
acquire those OP units in exchange for shares of its common stock on a one-for-one
basis, subject to anti-dilution adjustments provided in the Operating
Partnership agreement.


During September 2006, the Company issued 182,828
Operating Partnership units valued at $3.1 million in conjunction with the
acquisition of a property in Rockville, Maryland. During July 2006,
200,000 Operating Partnership units were redeemed in exchange for common stock.

As of December 31, 2006, the
Operating Partnership had 3,808,615 and 200,046 OP units and CCUs outstanding,
respectively.

On July 14, 2005, the Company issued 1,470,149 OP
units valued at $21.6 million in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition. On
September 9, 2005 and November 2, 2005, 350,000 and 50,000 OP units
were redeemed in exchange for common stock, respectively.

Unlike the OP units, CCUs do not carry any voting
rights. Upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to 14
early-stage lease-up properties, all or a portion of the CCUs will be
automatically converted into OP Units. Initially, each CCU will be convertible
on a one-for-one basis into OP Units, subject to customary anti-dilution
adjustments. Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2006, and ending
with the quarter ending December 31, 2008, the Company calculates the net
operating income from the 14 wholly-owned early-stage lease-up properties over
the 12-month period ending in such quarter. Within 35 days following the
end of each quarter referred to above, some or all of the CCUs will be
converted so that the total percentage (not to exceed 100%) of CCUs issued in
connection with the formation transactions that have been converted to OP units
will be equal to the percentage determined by dividing the net operating income
for such period in excess of $5.1 million by $4.6 million. If any CCU
remains unconverted through the calculation made in respect of the 12-month
period ending December 31, 2008, such outstanding CCUs will be cancelled.

While any CCUs remain outstanding, a majority of the
Company’s independent directors must review and approve the net operating
income calculation for each measurement period and also must approve the sale
of any of the 14 wholly-owned early-stage lease-up properties.

No CCUs had been converted
as of December 31, 2006. Based on the performance of the properties as of December 31,
2006, 2,693 CCUs became eligible for conversion. The board of directors
approved the conversion of these CCUs on February 1, 2007 as per the
Company’s Articles of Incorporation, and the units were issued on February 5,
2007.

16.

REDEEMABLE
MINORITY INTEREST—FIDELITY

Through December 31, 2003, the Predecessor,
through a consolidated subsidiary, Extra Space Properties Four, LLC, had received
net cash proceeds of $14,156 (net of transaction costs of $1,403) from FREAM No. 39,
LLC and Fidelity Pension Fund Real Estate Investments (collectively, “Fidelity”).
The Predecessor was accreting the discount related to the transaction costs
over the five-year period ended November 25, 2006, the first date the
investment was redeemable by Fidelity.

This investment earned a 22% preferred return, of
which 9% was payable quarterly with the remainder payable upon redemption. The
earliest date at which the investment could be repaid without penalty at the
option of the Predecessor was November 25, 2004. The investment was
redeemable November 25, 2006 at the option of Fidelity.

On September 9, 2004,
the Operating Partnership completed its acquisition of the preferred equity
interest held by Fidelity in Extra Space Properties Four LLC. This interest was
acquired for approximately $21,530 in cash, which included the preferred return
through November 25, 2004. The Company recorded a loss on early redemption
of $1,478.

STOCKHOLDERS’
AND MEMBERS’ EQUITY

Stockholders’
Equity

On September 25, 2006, the Company closed a
public common stock offering of 12,075,000 shares at an offering price of
$17.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $205,275. Transaction costs were
$10,374, resulting in net proceeds of $194,901.

On December 9, 2005, the Company closed a public
common stock offering of 13,800,000 shares at an offering price of $14.57 per
share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $201.1 million. Transaction costs
were $10.9 million, resulting in net proceeds of $190.2 million. The
proceeds were used to repay outstanding bridge and other loans and for general
corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and debt repayment.

On June 20, 2005, the Company completed a private
placement of 6,200,000 shares of its common stock at an offering price of
$13.47 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $83.5 million.
Transaction costs were $2.2 million, resulting in net proceeds of
$81.3 million. The shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the
registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. Pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the
Company filed a registration statement covering the shares on September 22,
2005. The registration statement was deemed effective on November 14,
2005.

The Company’s charter provides that it can issue up to
200,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, 4,100,000 CCSs,
$.01 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par
value per share. As of December 31, 2006, 64,167,098 shares of common
stock were issued and outstanding, 3,888,843 CCSs were issued and outstanding
and no shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding.

All stockholders of the Company’s common stock are
entitled to receive dividends and to one vote on all matters submitted to a
vote of stockholders. The transfer agent and registrar for the Company’s common
stock is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company.

Unlike the Company’s shares of common stock, CCSs do
not carry any voting rights. Upon the achievement of certain performance
thresholds relating to 14 early-stage lease-up properties, all or a
portion of the CCSs will be automatically converted into shares of the Company’s
common stock. Initially, each CCS will be convertible on a one-for-one basis
into shares of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.
Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2006, and ending with the
quarter ending December 31, 2008, the Company calculates the net operating
income from the 14 wholly-owned early-stage lease-up properties over the
12-month period ending in such quarter. Within 35 days following the
end of each quarter referred to above, some or all of the CCSs will be
converted so that the total percentage (not to exceed 100%) of CCSs issued in
connection with the formation transactions that have been converted to common
stock will be equal to the percentage determined by dividing the net operating
income for such period in excess of $5.1 million by $4.6 million. If
any CCS remains unconverted through the calculation made in respect of the 12-month
period ending December 31, 2008, such outstanding CCSs will be cancelled
and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

While any CCSs remain outstanding, a majority of the
Company’s independent directors must review and approve the net operating
income calculation for each measurement period and also must approve the sale
of any of the 14 wholly-owned early-stage lease-up properties.

No CCSs had been converted
as of December 31, 2006. Based on the performance of the properties as of December 31,
2006, 52,349 CCSs became eligible for conversion. The board of directors
approved the conversion of these CCSs on February 1, 2007 as per the
Company’s Articles of Incorporation, and the shares were issued on February 5,
2007.


Members’ Equity

Members’ profits, losses and distributions of the
Predecessor were allocated in accordance with the terms of the Predecessor’s
operating agreement, as amended. Member unit holders included members of
management. Member interests were divided into four classes of units.

Class A units were common units with voting
rights and no par value. There were also non-voting Class A units held by
certain employees. During April 2004, the Predecessor granted 4,019,837 Class A
Units, valued at $0.30 per unit, to certain employees, resulting in a
compensation charge of $1,205. All Class A units were redeemed or
converted to common stock as of August 17, 2004 at the option of the
holder.

Class B units were preferred units with a par
value of $1.00. These units were non-convertible, non-voting and earned a 9%
preferred return (non-compounding) with no current dividend paid. The 9% preferred
return was paid based upon available funds, including upon liquidation or
termination. All Class B units were redeemed or converted to common stock
as of August 17, 2004 at the option of the holder.

Class C units were preferred units with a par
value of $1.00. These units were non-convertible, non-voting and earned a 9%
preferred return with current dividends paid quarterly. All Class C units
were redeemed or converted to common stock as of August 17, 2004 at the
option of the holder.

Class E units were preferred units with a par
value of $1.00. These units were non-convertible, non-voting and earned a 7%
preferred return with current dividends paid quarterly. These units were
redeemable after July 1, 2004 at the option of the holder. All E units
were redeemed or converted to common stock as of August 17, 2004 at the
option of the holder.

Class B, C and E
units did not participate in the distribution of profits after payment of the
preferred return.

18.

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had
authorized 8,800,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Company’s
two stock compensation plans: (1) the 2004 Long-Term Incentive
Compensation Plan, and (2) the 2004 Non-Employee Directors’ Share Plan.

Under the terms of the Plans, the exercise price of an
option shall be determined by the Compensation, Nominating and Governance
Committee and reflected in the applicable award agreement. All option grants
have been issued at the five day average close price prior to the date of the grant.
Each option will be exercisable after the period or periods specified in the
award agreement (typically four years), which will generally not exceed
10 years from the date of grant. Options will be exercisable at such times
and subject to such terms as determined by the Compensation, Nominating and
Governance Committee, but under no circumstances may be exercised if such
exercise would cause a violation of the ownership limit in the Company’s
charter. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation, Nominating and
Governance Committee at the time of grant, such stock options shall vest
ratably over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant.

Also as defined under the
terms of the Plans, restricted stock grants may be awarded. The stock grants are
subject to a performance or vesting period over which the restrictions are
lifted and the stock certificates are given to the grantee. During the
performance or vesting period, the grantee is not permitted to sell, transfer,
pledge, encumber or assign shares of restricted stock granted under the plan,
however, has the ability to vote the shares and receive the dividends paid on
the shares. The forfeiture and transfer restriction on the shares lapse over a
two to four year period beginning on the date of grant.


Option Grants to Employees

As of December 31, 2006, 5,143,286 shares were
available for issuance under the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. A

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The
Company has an operating lease on its corporate offices and owns nine
self-storage facilities that are subject to ground leases. At December 31,
2006, future minimum rental payments under these non-cancelable operating
leases are as follows:


$

4,634


4,459


4,342


4,266


3,597

Thereafter

20,631

$

41,929

The monthly rental amount for one of the ground leases
is the greater of a minimum amount or a percentage of gross monthly receipts.
The Company recorded rent expense of $2,641, $2,591, and $1,332 related to
these leases in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

The Company has guaranteed two construction loans for
unconsolidated partnerships that own development properties in Baltimore,
Maryland, and Chicago, Illinois. These properties are owned by joint ventures
in which the Company has 10% equity interests. These guarantees were entered
into in November 2004 and July 2005, respectively. At December 31,
2006, the total amount of guaranteed mortgage debt relating to these joint
ventures was $13,022 (unaudited). These mortgage loans mature December 1,
2007 and July 28, 2008, respectively. If the joint ventures default on the
loans, the Company may be forced to repay the loans. Repossessing and/or
selling the self-storage facilities and land that collateralize the loans could
provide funds sufficient to reimburse the Company. The estimated fair market
value of the encumbered assets at December 31, 2006 is $16,656
(unaudited). The Company has recorded no liability in relation to this
guarantee as of December 31, 2006. The fair value of the guarantee is not
material. To date, the joint ventures have not defaulted on their mortgage
debt. The Company believes the risk of having to perform on the guarantee is
remote.

The Company has been
involved in routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As
of December 31, 2006, the Company is not presently involved in any
material litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any material litigation
threatened against its properties.

Item 9A.

Controls
and Procedures

(i)    Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of
“disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of
assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

We have formed a disclosure committee that is
responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the
disclosure obligations of the Company on a timely basis. The disclosure
committee reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer.

We carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based
upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the
end of the period covered by this report.

(ii)   Internal Control over Financial Reporting

(a)   Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal
conrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


Our management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which is included herein.

(b)   Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting
Firm

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Extra
Space Storage Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Extra Space Storage Inc. (the “Company”) maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006,
and the related consolidated statement of operations, redeemable units and
members’ and stockholders’ equity, and cash


flows
for the year ended December 31, 2006 of Extra Space Storage Inc. and
our report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our
internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a- 15(f)) that occurred during our most recent quarter
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
