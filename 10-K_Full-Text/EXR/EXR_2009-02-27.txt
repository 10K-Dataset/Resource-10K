Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information

Certain information set forth in this report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the
federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures,
financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions and other information that is not historical information. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such
as "believes," "expects," "estimates," "may," "will," "should," "anticipates," or "intends" or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. We may also
make additional forward-looking statements from time to time. All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, by us or on our behalf, are also expressly qualified by these
cautionary statements.

All forward-looking statements, including without limitation, management's examination of historical operating trends and estimates of future earnings, are based
upon our current expectations and various assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them, but there can be no
assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. All forward-looking statements apply only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly
update or revise forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in or
contemplated by this report. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the risks referenced in "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" below. Such factors include, but are
not limited to:

•

changes in general economic conditions and in the markets in which we
operate;

•

the effect of competition from new self-storage facilities or other storage
alternatives, which would cause rents and occupancy rates to decline;

•

potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental
contamination;

•

difficulties in our ability to evaluate, finance and integrate acquired and developed properties
into our existing operations and to lease up those properties, which could adversely affect our profitability;

•

the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national, state, and local laws and
regulations including, without limitation, those governing Real Estate Investment Trusts, which could increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for
distribution;

•

recent disruptions in credit and financial markets and resulting difficulties in raising capital
or obtaining credit at reasonable rates or at all, which could impede our ability to grow;

•

delays in the development and construction process, which could adversely affect our
profitability;

•

economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism, which could adversely affect our
business plan;

•

the successful realignment of our executive management team;
and

•

our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and management
members.

The forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account all information currently
available to us. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties and can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us. If
a change occurs, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may vary materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. You should carefully consider these
risks before you make an investment decision with respect to our securities.

We disclaim any duty or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect
new information, future events or otherwise.



PART I

Item 1.    Business

General

Extra Space Storage Inc. ("we," "our," "us" or the "Company") is a self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust ("REIT") formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004 to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage
facilities. We closed our initial public offering ("IPO") on August 17, 2004. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "EXR."

We
were formed to continue the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries (the "Predecessor"), which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. These
companies were reorganized after the consummation of our IPO and various formation transactions. As of December 31, 2008, we held ownership interests in 627 operating properties. Of these 627
operating properties, 279 are wholly-owned, and 348 are owned in joint-venture partnerships. An additional 67 operating properties are owned by franchisees or third parties and operated by us in
exchange for a management fee, bringing the total number of operating properties which we own and/or manage to 694. These operating properties are located in 33 states and Washington, D.C. and contain
approximately 50 million square feet of net rentable space in approximately 475,000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 300,000 tenants.

We
operate in two distinct segments: (1) property management, acquisition and development and (2) rental operations. Our property management, acquisition and development
activities include managing, acquiring developing, redeveloping and selling self-storage facilities. The rental operations activities include rental operations of self-storage
facilities.

Substantially
all of our business is conducted through Extra Space Storage LP (the "Operating Partnership"), and through our wholly-owned Massachusetts business trust subsidiaries. Our
primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. We have elected to be
taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). To the extent we continue to qualify as a REIT we will not be subject to tax, with certain
exceptions, on our net taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders.

We
file our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). You may obtain copies of these documents by visiting the SEC's Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20549, by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 or by accessing the SEC's website at

http://www.sec.gov

. In addition, as
soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are furnished to the SEC, we make copies of these documents available to the public free of charge through our website at

www.extraspace.com

, or by
contacting our Secretary at our principal offices, which are located at
2795 East Cottonwood Parkway, Suite 400, Salt Lake City, Utah 84121, telephone number (801) 562-5556.

Management

Members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the self-storage industry, and have
an average of more than sixteen years of industry experience. The senior management team has collectively acquired and/or developed more than 725 properties during the past 30 years for the
Company, the Predecessor and other entities. Kenneth M. Woolley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard S. Tanner, Senior Vice President Development, have worked in the
self-storage industry since 1977 and led some of the earliest self-storage facility development projects in the United States.



The
remainder of our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows: Spencer F. Kirk, President, 8 years; Kent W. Christensen,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 11 years; Charles L. Allen, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, 11 years; and Karl Haas, Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer, 21 years.

On
February 2, 2009, we announced that Mr. Woolley had accepted an invitation to serve a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and will
step down from his position as Chief Executive Officer beginning April 1, 2009. Our Board of Directors has selected Mr. Kirk to succeed him as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The
composition of the Board of Directors will remain the same with the exception of the Chairman position which will be assumed by Mr. Kirk.

Members
of the executive management team have guided the Company through substantial growth, developing and acquiring over $3.3 billion in assets since 1996. This growth has been
funded through equity offerings and more than $2.0 billion in private equity capital since 1998. This private equity capital has come primarily from sophisticated, high net-worth
individuals and institutional investors such as affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. and Fidelity Investments.

Our
executive management and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the Company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 7,243,647 shares or 8.44%
of our outstanding common stock as of February 13, 2009.

Industry & Competition

Self-storage facilities refers to properties that offer do-it-yourself,
month-to-month storage space rental for personal or business use. Self-storage offers a cost-effective and flexible storage alternative. Tenants rent
fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited, exclusive access. Tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of
their units. Self-storage unit sizes typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet, with an interior height of eight to 12 feet. Properties
generally have on-site managers who supervise and run the day-to-day operations, providing tenants with assistance as needed.

Self-storage
provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes, or simply because of a need for storage space. The mix
of residential tenants using a self-storage property is determined by a property's local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who
are not yet settled into a permanent residence.

Items
that residential tenants place in self-storage properties range from cars, boats and recreational vehicles, to furniture, household items and appliances. Commercial
tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods, records, inventory or storage for seasonal goods.

Our
research has shown that tenants choose a self-storage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business, making high-density,
high-traffic population centers ideal locations for self-storage properties. A property's perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are
also contributing factors to a site's ability to successfully secure rentals. Although most self-storage properties are leased to tenants on a month-to-month basis,
tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time.

There
are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for self-storage properties. Based on our experience, generally, there is increased leasing activity at
self-storage properties during the summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period. The highest level of occupancy is typically at the end of July, while
the lowest level of occupancy is seen in late February and early March.



Since
inception in the early 1970's, the self-storage industry has experienced significant growth. In the past ten years, there has been even greater growth. According to the
2009 Self-Storage Almanac (the "Almanac"), in 1998 there were only 27,535 self-storage properties in the United States, with an average occupancy rate of 82.9% of net rentable
square feet, compared to 47,514 self-storage properties in 2008 with an average occupancy rate of 80.3% of net rentable square feet. As population densities have increased in the United
States, there has been an increase in self-storage awareness and corresponding development, which we expect will continue in the future.

Increased
competition has affected our business and has led to both pricing and discount pressure. This has limited our ability to increase revenues in many markets in which we operate.
Many markets have been able to absorb the increase in self-storage development due to superior demographics and density. However, select markets have not been able to absorb the new
facilities and have not performed as well.

We
have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties, especially for brokered portfolios. Aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and
private entities, and this competition will likely continue to be a challenge for the Company's growth strategy.

Increased
development within the self-storage industry has also led to an increased emphasis on site location, property design, innovation and functionality. We strive to
have a creative and flexible approach to our development projects and we are open to a broad array of opportunities because of this flexibility. This is especially true for new sites slated for
high-density population centers. We can offer unique and attractive architecture to accommodate the requirements and tastes of local planning and zoning boards, and to distinguish a
facility from other offerings in the market. Due to the attractive architecture of many of our development properties, we have been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most
self-storage developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial users.

The
industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership. According to the 2009 Almanac, the top ten self-storage companies in the United States owned approximately 10.3%
of total U.S. self-storage properties, and the top 50 self-storage companies owned approximately 14.3% of the total U.S. properties. We believe this fragmentation will
contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future. We also believe that we are well positioned to be able to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals.

We
are the second largest self-storage operator in the United States. We are one of four public self-storage REITs along with Public Storage Inc.
(NYSE: PSA), Sovran Self-Storage, Inc. (NYSE: SSS), and U-Store-It Inc. (NYSE: YSI).

Long-Term Growth and Investment Strategies

Our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable
long-term growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term stockholder value. We continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities, including the
following:

•

Maximize the performance of properties through strategic, efficient and
proactive management.

We plan to pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations. Our revenue
management team will seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology system's ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount
management. Our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national, regional and local marketing programs, which we believe will attract more customers to our
stores at a lower net cost.



•

Expand our management
business.

Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint.
This expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. We expect to pursue strategic
relationships with owners that should strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale.
Twenty-one of the 50 acquisitions we completed in 2008 and 2007 came from this channel.

•

Acquire self-storage properties from strategic partners and
third parties.

Our acquisitions team will continue to selectively pursue the acquisition of single properties and multi-property
portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value. We have sought to establish a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close
acquisitions. In addition, our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals.

•

Develop new self-storage
properties.

We currently have joint venture and wholly-owned development properties and may continue selectively to develop new
self-storage properties in our core markets. Our development pipeline through 2010 includes 26 projects.

Financing of Our Long-Term Growth Strategies

•

Acquisition and Development
Financing

We
currently have a $100.0 million revolving line of credit (the "Credit Line") that is collateralized by certain of our self-storage properties. As of December 31, 2008, the
Credit Line had asset collateralizing capacity of $100.0 million of which $27.0 million was drawn. We expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions. We
plan to finance future acquisitions and development through a combination of borrowings under the Credit Line, traditional secured mortgage financing and additional equity offerings. We drew an
additional $50.0 million from the Credit Line on January 30, 2009.

•

Joint Venture
Financing

We
own 334 of our stabilized properties and 14 of our lease-up properties through joint ventures with third parties, including affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. In each joint
venture, we generally manage the day-to-day operations of the underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties or
financings by the applicable joint venture. Our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business. Under the operating
agreements for the joint ventures, we typically maintain the right to receive between 17.0% and 50.0% of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners have received a
predetermined return, and between 17.0% and 50.0% of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined
return. Most joint venture agreements include buy-sell rights, as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint venture.

•

Disposition of
Properties

We
will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to sell these properties to fund other growth.

Regulation

Generally, self-storage properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating
to lien sale rights and procedures. Changes in any of these laws or regulations, as



well
as changes in laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act ("CERCLA"), which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or
circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties, or laws affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated
expenditures, loss of self-storage sites or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Under
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA"), all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled
persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws also
exist that may require modifications to the properties, or restrict further renovations thereof, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the
imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures.
To the extent our properties are not in compliance, we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ADA.

Insurance
activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson
Act, and are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.

Property
management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.

Changes
in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of February 13, 2009, we had 1,947 employees and believe our relationship with our employees to be good. Our employees are
not represented by a collective bargaining agreement.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

An investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in
conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report before trading in our securities. If any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur, our business, operating
results, prospects and financial condition could be harmed.

Our
performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments. We are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties. There are a number of
factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate, including the following:

Risks Related to Our Properties and Operations

Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating
results.

Our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our self-storage
properties. Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts. If
our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements, including operating and other expenses, debt service and capital expenditures, our net income, funds from operations
("FFO"), cash flow, financial condition, ability to make cash distributions to



stockholders
and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the operating performance of our
properties:

•

the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate, which may be
adversely impacted by, among other factors, industry slowdowns, relocation of businesses and changing demographics;

•

periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates, or declining demand for self-storage or the
public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults;

•

the continuation or worsening of the current economic environment;

•

local or regional real estate market conditions such as the oversupply of self-storage or a reduction in
demand for self-storage in a particular area;

•

perceptions by prospective users of our self-storage properties of the safety, convenience and attractiveness
of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located;

•

increased operating costs, including the need for capital improvements, insurance premiums, real estate taxes and
utilities;

•

changes in the supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area;

•

the impact of environmental protection laws;

•

earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, terrorist acts, civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in
uninsured or underinsured losses; and

•

changes in tax, real estate and zoning laws.

Recent
U.S. and international market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging, with tighter credit conditions and slower growth through the third and fourth
quarters of
2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and other
macro-economic factors have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and increased market uncertainty and instability. Continued turbulence in U.S.
and international markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the financial condition of our customers. If these market conditions continue, they may result in an adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

If we are unable to promptly re-let our units or if the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than expected, then our business and
results of operations would be adversely affected.

Virtually all of our leases are on a month-to-month basis. Any delay in re-letting units as
vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, lower than expected rental rates upon re-letting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our
growth.

We depend upon our on-site personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties, and any difficulties we encounter in hiring, training and
maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance.

We had 1,615 field personnel as of February 13, 2009 in the management and operation of our properties. The general
professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a site's ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants. We also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean
and secure self-storage properties. If we are unable to successfully recruit, train and



retain
qualified field personnel, the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating
performance.

Other self-storage operators may employ STORE or a technology similar to STORE, which could enhance their ability to compete with us.

We rely on STORE, a state-of-the-art, proprietary, web-based tracking and yield
management technology, to support all aspects of our business operations and to help us implement new development and acquisition opportunities and strategies. If other self-storage
companies obtain a license to use STORE, or employ or develop a technology similar to STORE, their ability to compete with us could be enhanced.

Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow.

We maintain comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders), extended
coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties with policy specifications, limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties. Certain types of losses, however, may
be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war or terrorism. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our
investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property. In addition, if any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay a significant deductible on any claim for recovery of such a
loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.

Increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income.

Costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us. Increases
in income, property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income, FFO, cash flow, financial condition, ability to pay or refinance our debt
obligations, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders, and the trading price of our securities. Similarly, changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions
existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could similarly adversely affect our business and
results of operations.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations.

Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the
costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property. Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or
operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such substances or materials. The presence of such substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may
adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to lease, sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated
by such person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties
for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials.



Certain
environmental laws also impose liability, without regard to knowledge or fault, for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and
operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property. Moreover, the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal
injuries or property damages that may result from such releases, as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases.

Certain
environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances.
For example, environmental laws govern the management of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions.

No
assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of our
properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties. There also
exists the risk that material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future. Finally, future laws, ordinances
or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability.

Costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses.

Under the ADA, all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by
disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties, or restrict certain further
renovations of the properties, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and
also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our
properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ADA or
other legislation, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or other legislation, our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could
be adversely affected.

Our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns, which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available
for distributions.

A component of our growth strategy is exploring new asset development and redevelopment opportunities through strategic joint ventures
and on a wholly-owned basis. To the extent that we engage in these development and redevelopment activities, they will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these
projects:

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all;

•

we may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;

•

we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required
governmental permits and authorizations; and



•

occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors,
including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investment not being profitable.

In
deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. We may underestimate the costs
necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly acquired property as quickly as expected or at all.
Any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results, liquidity and financial
condition, which could result in a decline in the value of our securities.

We
may in the future develop self-storage properties in geographic regions where we do not currently have a significant presence and where we do not possess the same level of
familiarity with development, which could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties successfully or at all or to achieve expected performance.

We
rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects. If our reputation in the self-storage industry
changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced, our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected, which would limit our growth.

We face competition for the acquisition of self-storage properties and other assets, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the
cost of these acquisitions.

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of self-storage
properties and other assets, including national, regional and local operators and developers of self-storage properties. These competitors may drive up the price we must pay for
self-storage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our
competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In addition, the number of entities
and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. This competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them.
Because of an increased interest in single-property acquisitions among tax-motivated individual purchasers, we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with
portfolio acquisitions. If we pay higher prices for self-storage properties or other assets, our profitability will be reduced.

We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth.

Our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition
candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. We may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our
acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to identify or consummate acquisitions may slow our growth, which could in turn adversely
affect our stock price.

Our
ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks:

•

competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital, including other publicly-traded
REITs and institutional investment funds;



•

competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our
profitability;

•

the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions;

•

failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all;

•

we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;
and

•

we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to
unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for
indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

In
addition, strategic decisions by us, such as acquisitions, may adversely affect the price of our securities.

We may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties.

We expect to make future acquisitions of self-storage properties. If we acquire any self-storage properties, we
will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio. The acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated, may cause disruptions
in our operations or may divert management's attention away from day-to-day operations, which could impair our results of operations as a whole.

We do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties, and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by
third-party appraisals.

We do not always obtain third-party appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us
in exchange for those properties may exceed the value as determined by third-party appraisals. In such cases, the terms of any agreements and the valuation methods used to determine the value of the
properties were determined by our senior management team.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure

Our business could be harmed if key personnel with long-standing business relationships in the self-storage industry terminate their employment with
us.

Our success depends, to a significant extent, on the continued services of members of our executive management team. Our executive
management team has substantial experience in the self-storage industry. In addition, our ability to continue to develop properties depends on the significant relationships our executive
management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. There is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us.
We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers. The loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects.

We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different risks.

We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our
stockholders, which could result in our making investments and



engaging
in business activities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this document. A change in our investment strategy or our entry into new
lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations.

If other self-storage companies convert to an UPREIT structure or if tax laws change, we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions.

Because we are structured as an UPREIT, we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to tax-motivated sellers than our
competitors that are not structured as UPREITs. However, if other self-storage companies restructure their holdings to become UPREITs, this competitive advantage will disappear. In
addition, new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), or the U.S. Treasury Department that could affect the
attractiveness of our UPREIT structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions.

Tax indemnification obligations may require the Operating Partnership to maintain certain debt levels.

In connection with the formation transactions entered into prior to our IPO in 2004, we agreed to make available to each of
Kenneth M. Woolley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard S. Tanner, our Senior Vice President, Development, and other third parties, the following tax protections: for nine
years, with a three-year extension if the applicable party continues to own at least 50% of the units in our Operating Partnership ("OP units") received by it in the formation transactions
at the expiration of the initial nine-year period, the opportunity to (1) guarantee debt or (2) enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation, in an
aggregate amount, with respect to the foregoing contributors, of at least $60.0 million. Similar tax protections were provided to third party contributors in connection with property
contributions to the Operating Partnership subsequent to the IPO. We agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions. These
obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business.

Our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority.

As of December 31, 2008, we held interests in 348 operating properties through joint ventures. Some of these arrangements could
be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers financial conditions and disputes between us and our co-venturers. We expect
to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new self-storage properties and acquiring existing properties. In such event, we
would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. The decision-making authority regarding the properties we
currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners, is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint
venture partners. In addition, investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the
possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or co-venturers may have economic or
other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may
also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture.
Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time
and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to
additional risk. In addition, we



may
in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers, which could harm our financial condition.

Kenneth M. Woolley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Spencer F. Kirk, President, Richard S. Tanner, Senior Vice President, Development,
Kent W. Christensen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Charles L. Allen, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer and other members of our senior
management team, have outside business interests which could divert their time and attention away from us, which could harm our business.

Kenneth M. Woolley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well and certain other members of our senior management team,
have outside business interests. These
business interests include the ownership of a self-storage property located in Pico Rivera, California. Other than this property, the members of our senior management are not currently
engaged in any other self-storage activities outside the Company. Mr. Woolley's employment agreement requires that he devote substantially his full business time and attention to
us, however, this agreement also permits him to devote time to his outside business interests. These outside business interests could interfere with his ability to devote time to our business and
affairs and as a result, our business could be harmed.

Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our Operating Partnership.

Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, and our Operating
Partnership or any partner thereof. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, we,
through our wholly-owned subsidiary, have fiduciary duties, as a general partner, to our Operating Partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of our
Operating Partnership. Our duties, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, as a general partner to our Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and
officers to our Company. The partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our Company or the limited partners in our Operating
Partnership. Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty
standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness, and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any
transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest.

Additionally,
the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we, our direct wholly-owned Massachusetts business trust subsidiary, as the general
partner of the Operating Partnership, nor any of our or their trustees, directors or officers, will be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, the limited partners or assignees
for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we, or such trustee, director or officer, acted in good faith. In addition, our Operating Partnership is required to
indemnify us, our affiliates and each of our respective trustees, officers, directors, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising
from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership, provided that our
Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (1) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (2) any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in
violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful.



The
provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we
have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law
were it not for the partnership agreement.

We may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our officers.

Kenneth M. Woolley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Spencer F. Kirk, President, Kent W. Christensen,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Charles L. Allen, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, and Richard S. Tanner, Senior Vice President, Development had
direct or indirect ownership interests in certain properties that were contributed to our Operating Partnership in the formation transactions. Following the completion of the formation transactions,
we, under the agreements relating to the contribution of such interests, became entitled to indemnification and damages in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the
contributors. In addition, Kenneth M. Woolley's employment agreement includes an exception to his non-competition covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote time to the
management of other business interests. None of these contribution and non-competition agreements was negotiated at an arm's-length basis. We may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less
vigorously, our rights under these contribution and non-competition agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships with the individuals party to these agreements.

Certain provisions of Maryland law and our organizational documents, including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter, may inhibit market activity in our stock and
could prevent or delay a change in control transaction.

Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve
our qualification as a REIT and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common
stock or 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding capital stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from
the ownership limit. However, our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. These
restrictions on ownership will not apply
if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a
change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Different ownership limits apply to the family of Kenneth M.
Woolley, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and Spencer F. Kirk, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and
trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and certain designated investment entities (as defined in our charter).

Our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders.

Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and
to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval. In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any
unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could issue additional shares of our
common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the



effect
of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our
stockholders.

Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.

Maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good
faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition,
our charter eliminates our directors' and officers' liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property
or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. Our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for
liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our
directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers.

To the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a
subsequent sale of common stock.

Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to
a U.S. stockholder under current U.S. federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his, her, or its common stock, but instead will
constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis. If distributions result in a reduction of a stockholder's adjusted basis in such holder's common stock, subsequent sales of such
holder's common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis.

Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our primary business involves the ownership, operation and development of self-storage properties.

Our current strategy is to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop only self-storage properties. Consequently,
we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry. Because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid, this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment
portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change. Decreases in market rents, negative tax, real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also
increase our costs, lower the value of our investments and decrease our income, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties.

Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in
response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing,
interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property
for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a
willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.

We
may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those
defects or



to
make those improvements. In acquiring a property, we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions,
such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. These transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or
appropriate.

Any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield income-producing returns, if at all, and may result in additional costs to us to comply
with re-zoning restrictions or environmental regulations.

We have invested in the past, and may invest in the future, in unimproved real property. Unimproved properties generally take longer to
yield income-producing returns based on the typical time required for development. Any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with
re-zoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups. Any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an
income-producing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay
operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results.

Any negative perceptions of the self-storage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price.

To the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the self-storage industry, the value of our securities
may be negatively impacted, which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets.

Risks Related to Our Debt Financings

Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us.

The United States credit markets are experiencing significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on
prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive, and in certain
cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to
refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund current and future development projects. A prolonged downturn
in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make
it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or
difficulties in obtaining debt financing. These events in the credit markets have also had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the United States, which may make it more difficult or costly
for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities. These disruptions in the financial markets may have other adverse effects on us or the economy
generally, which could cause our stock price to decline.

Required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or
necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness. We may incur additional debt in
connection with future acquisitions and development. We may borrow under



our
Credit Line or borrow new funds to finance these future properties. Additionally, we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness
upon maturity and, therefore, we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity and/or debt offerings. Further, we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to
maintain our qualification as a REIT or to make our expected distributions.

If
we are required to utilize our Credit Line for purposes other than acquisition activity, this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth. Therefore,
our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:

•

our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;

•

we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, including to make acquisitions or to continue
to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT;

•

we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms
of our original indebtedness;

•

because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, an increase in interest rates could materially increase
our interest expense;

•

we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms;

•

after debt service, the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced;

•

our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt;

•

we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns, reducing our ability to respond to changing
business and economic conditions;

•

we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans
and receive an assignment of rents and leases;

•

we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt
obligations; and

•

our default under any one of our mortgage loans with cross-default or cross-collateralization provisions could result in a
default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties.

We could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur.

Our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our Operating Partnership may incur. We
could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time. If we become more highly leveraged, then the resulting increase in debt service could
adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated cash distributions and/or to continue to make cash distributions to maintain our REIT
qualification, and could harm our financial condition.



Increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to
our stockholders.

As of December 31, 2008 we had approximately $1.3 billion of debt outstanding, of which approximately
$152.4 million or 11.7% was subject to variable interest rates (including $61.8 million on which we had a reverse interest rate swap). This variable rate debt had a weighted average
interest rate of approximately 1.6% per annum. Increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash
distributions. For example, if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by
approximately $1.5 million annually.

Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.

In certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements. Hedging
involves risks, such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders.

Risks Related to Qualification and Operation as a REIT

To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions.

To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding net
capital gains, and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. In addition, we are subject to a 4%
nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100%
of our undistributed income from prior years. While historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our
shareholders, a REIT is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. For distributions with respect to
taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2009, recent Internal Revenue Service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90% of the distribution requirements discussed above through the
distribution of shares of our stock, if certain conditions are met. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term
basis, or possibly long-term, to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could
result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures,
the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments.

Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.

The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual U.S. stockholders is 15% (through
2010). Dividends paid by REITs, however, are generally not eligible for the reduced rates. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are
individuals to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the
value of the stock of REITs, including our securities.



In
addition, the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends, which could negatively affect
the value of our properties.

Possible legislative or other actions affecting REITs could adversely affect our stockholders.

The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by
the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what
forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed.

The power of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.

Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our
stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our
taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders.

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.

We believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue
Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT or lose our qualification as a REIT at any time, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for
each of the years involved because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject
to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

we also could be subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four
taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified.

In
addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular
corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that our U.S. individual
stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates, and our U.S. corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject,
in each case, to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief
provisions under the Internal Revenue Code in order to maintain our REIT status, we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of $50,000 or more for each such failure. As a result of all these
factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our securities.



Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and
administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code is greater in the case of a
REIT that, like us, holds its assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.
In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets, the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock.
Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to precise determination, and for which we will not obtain
independent appraisals. Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to income tax at
regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income including capital gains. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court
decisions may adversely affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments.
Although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will
continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our qualification as a REIT.

We will pay some taxes.

Even though we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some U.S. federal, state and local
taxes on our income and property. Extra Space Management, Inc. manages self-storage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. We, jointly
with Extra Space Management, Inc., elected to treat Extra Space Management, Inc. as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" of our Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT
subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation, and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us. In addition, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain amounts if the
economic arrangements among our tenants, our taxable REIT subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held
for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Also, if we sell property as a dealer (i.e., to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business), we will be subject to a
100% penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales. While we don't intend to sell properties as a dealer, the IRS could take a contrary position. To the extent that we are or our taxable REIT
subsidiary is required to pay U.S. federal, state or local taxes, we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders.

Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.

To qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the
sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to
forego attractive business or investment opportunities. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.



Item 2.    Properties

As of December 31, 2008, we owned or had ownership interests in 627 operating self-storage properties. Of these
properties, 279 are wholly-owned and 348 are held in joint ventures. In addition, we managed an additional 67 properties for franchisees or third parties bringing the total number of properties which
we own and/or manage to 694. These properties are located in 33 states and Washington, D.C. We receive a management fee equal to approximately 6% of gross revenues to manage the joint venture, third
party and franchise sites. As of December 31, 2008, we own and or manage approximately 50 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 475,000 separate storage
units. Approximately 70% of our properties are clustered around large population centers, such as Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami,
New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco/Oakland. These markets contain above-average population and income demographics for new
self-storage properties. The clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. Our acquisitions have given us an
increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence.

We
consider a property to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. We consider a property to be
stabilized once it has achieved either an 80% occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1, or has been open for three years.

As
of December 31, 2008, over 300,000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 694 operating properties that we own and/or manage, primarily on a
month-to-month basis, providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Although leases are short-term in duration, the
typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time. For properties that were stabilized as of December 31, 2008, the median length of stay was approximately eleven
months.

Our
property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located. Most often sites are what
we consider "hybrid" facilities, a mix of both drive-up buildings and multi-floor buildings. We have a number of multi-floor buildings with elevator access only, and a number of facilities
featuring ground-floor access only.



The
following table sets forth additional information regarding the occupancy of our stabilized properties on a state-by-state basis as of December 31,
2008 and 2007. The information as of December 31, 2007 is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at December 31, 2008 were under our control as of December 31,
2007.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto
appearing elsewhere in this report. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of
forward-looking statements, see the section in this Form 10-K entitled "Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information." Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance
or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Form 10-K entitled
"Risk Factors." (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data.)

Overview

We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, formed to
continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties. Since 1996, our
fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of more than 640 self-storage properties.

At
December 31, 2008, we owned, had an ownership interest in, or managed 694 operating properties in 33 states and Washington, D.C. As of December 31, 2008, 279 of our
operating properties were wholly-owned, we held joint venture interests in 348 operating properties, and our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc., operated an additional 67
properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee. These operating properties contain approximately 50 million square feet of rentable space contained
in approximately 475,000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 300,000 tenants.

Our
properties are generally situated in convenient, highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago,
Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco/Oakland. These areas all enjoy above average population
growth and income levels. The clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. We consider a property to be in the
lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. A property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80%
occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1, or has been open for three years.

To
maximize the performance of our properties, we employ a state-of-the-art, proprietary, web-based tracking and yield management
technology called STORE. Developed by our management team, STORE enables us to analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions.
In addition, we also have an industry leading revenue management system (called "RevMan"). We believe that the combination of STORE's yield management capabilities and the systematic processes
developed by our team using RevMan allows us to more proactively manage revenues.

We
derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our self-storage properties, from management fees on the
properties we manage for joint-venture partners, franchisees and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program. Our management fee is equal to approximately 6% of total revenues
generated by the managed properties.

We
operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple self-storage properties from which to choose. Competition has impacted, and will continue to impact our
property results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. Our operating results depend
materially on our



ability
to lease available self-storage units, to actively manage unit rental rates, and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that we are able to
respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of STORE, and through the use of RevMan.

We
continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value. Our strategies to maximize stockholder value
include the following:

•

Maximize the performance of properties through strategic, efficient and
proactive management.

We plan to pursue revenue generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations. Our revenue
management team will seek to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology system's ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount
management. Our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national, regional and local marketing programs, which we believe will attract more customers to our
stores at a lower net cost.

•

Expand our management
business.

Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint.
This expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. We expect to pursue strategic
relationships with owners that should strengthen our acquisition pipeline through agreements which give us first right of refusal to purchase the managed property in the event of a potential sale.
Twenty-one of the 50 acquisitions we completed in 2008 and 2007 came from this channel.

•

Acquire self-storage properties from strategic partners and
third parties.

Our acquisitions team will continue to selectively pursue the acquisition of single properties and multi-property
portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value. We have sought to establish a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close
acquisitions. In addition, our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals.

•

Develop new self-storage
properties.

We currently have joint venture and wholly-owned development properties and may continue selectively to develop new
self-storage properties in our core markets. Our development pipeline through 2010 includes 26 projects.

During
2008, we acquired 11 wholly-owned properties and we completed the development of nine properties in our core markets. Of the completed development properties, eight are
wholly-owned, and one is owned by us in a joint venture. Joint venture properties provide us with a potential acquisition pipeline in the future. Fourteen development properties are scheduled for
completion in 2009, 11 of which are wholly-owned and three of which will be owned by us in joint ventures.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact
our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies:

CONSOLIDATION:

We follow FASB Interpretation No. 46R, "

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities

" ("FIN 46R"), which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs"). Under



FIN 46R,
arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as VIEs. An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the
VIE.

Under
FIN 46R, a VIE is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity's equity holders as a group either: (a) lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or
similar rights, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they
occur. If an entity is deemed to be a VIE pursuant to FIN 46R, the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of
the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.

Based
on the provisions of FIN 46R, we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we (1) enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from
an entity and pay a non-refundable deposit, or (2) enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (i),
(ii) (b) or (c) of the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, we have considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined
in FIN 46R. If we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with our financial statements. Additionally, our
Operating Partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are VIEs under condition (ii)(a) above. Since the Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts, these VIEs are
not consolidated.

REAL ESTATE ASSETS:

Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated
with the
development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction
period are capitalized.

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are
generally between five and 39 years.

In
connection with our acquisition of properties, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values. The value of
the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, are determined as if vacant, that is, at replacement cost. Intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are
recorded at their fair values. We measure the value of tenant relationships based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities. We amortize to expense the tenant relationships on a
straight-line basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility (currently estimated to be 18 months).

Intangible
lease rights include: (1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are
amortized to expense over the term of the leases and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on four properties that were acquired in 2007. These ground leases were assumed by the Company at
rates that were lower than the current market rates for similar leases. The value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the lease terms.

EVALUATION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT:

We evaluate long-lived assets which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances
indicate
that there may be an impairment. If such events occur, we compare the carrying value of these long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the
assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset. The



impairment
loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset.

When
real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value, net of selling costs. If the estimated fair
value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets, then a valuation allowance is established. The operations of assets
held for sale or sold during the period are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE:

We account for our investments in debt and equity securities according to the provisions of Statement of
Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

," which requires securities classified
as "available for sale" to be stated at fair value. Adjustments to the fair value of available for sale securities are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. A decline in the fair
value of investment securities below cost, that is deemed to be other than temporary, results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost
basis for the security is established. We classified our investments in auction rate securities as investments available for sale in the accompanying balance sheet. These investments were carried at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive deficit. Unrealized losses that were other-than-temporary were recognized in earnings.
We had no investments available for sale as of December 31, 2008.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other financial instruments
included in other
assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, variable rate notes payable, line of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007
approximate fair value. The fair value of the note receivable to the Preferred OP unit holder at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $124,024 and $108,915, respectively. The carrying value of the
note receivable to the Preferred OP unit holder at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $100,000 and $100,000 respectively. The aggregate fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to
trusts at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1,062,949 and $968,519, respectively. The carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at December 31, 2008 and
2007 was $937,756 and $944,916, respectively. The fair value of our exchangeable senior notes at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $131,039 and $286,947, respectively. The carrying value of the
exchangeable senior notes at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $209,663 and $250,000, respectively.

INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE VENTURES:

Our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control,
and joint
ventures which are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Under
the equity method, our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of
real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the purposes of presentation in the statement of
cash flows, we follow the "look through" approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts
and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture's sale of
assets) in which case it is reported as an investing activity.

Our
management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired when events or circumstances indicate
that there



may
be an impairment. An investment is impaired if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred, and it is
considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133,
"

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

," as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and hedging activities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used
to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure
to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For
derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income, outside of earnings and subsequently
reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.

CONVERSION OF OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS:

Conversions of Operating Partnership units to common stock, when converted under the
original provisions
of the agreement, are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance with EITF No. 95-7,
"

Implementation Issues Related to the Treatment of Minority Interest in Certain Real Estate Investment Trusts.

"

REVENUE AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION:

Rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases
are
generally on month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are recognized as a
reduction to rental income over the promotional period. Late charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned. Management and franchise fee
revenues
are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the management agreements. Tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of insurance
coverage. Equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. Interest income is recognized as
earned.

Property
expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. We accrue for property tax expense
based upon estimates and historical trends. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected.

REAL ESTATE SALES:

We evaluate real estate sales for both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS
No. 66, "

Accounting for Sales of Real Estate

." In general, sales of real estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration
has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition; other forms of continuing
involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition.

INCOME TAXES:

We have elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to
maintain our
qualification as a REIT, among other things, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and
assets. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed



annually
to our stockholders. We plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If we were
to fail to meet these requirements, we would be subject to federal income tax. We are subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in property operating and
general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.

We
have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries, Extra Space Management, Inc., as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). In general, our TRS may perform additional services
for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the
provision to any person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A TRS is subject to corporate
federal income tax. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 109, "

Accounting for Income
Taxes"

("FAS 109"). Under FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities.

We
adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, "

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes"

("FIN 48"), an
interpretation of FAS 109, on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax
benefits. At the adoption date of January 1, 2007, there were no material unrecognized tax benefits. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were also no material unrecognized tax benefits.

Interest
and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no interest or
penalties related to uncertain tax provisions.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "

Share-Based
Payment

," ("SFAS 123R"), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on
estimated fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes SFAS No. 123, "

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

" and Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, "

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

" ("APB 25"). We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective
application method of adoption which requires us to record compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant date
fair value of these awards over their remaining service period with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December 31, 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance with
provisions of SFAS 123R and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 157,

"Fair
Value Measurements"

("FAS 157"). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value
measurements. FAS 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement of
Position No. 157-2,

"Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157"

(the "FSP"). The FSP amends FAS 157 to delay the
effective date for FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis. For items within that scope, the FSP defers the effective date of FAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We
adopted FAS 157 effective January 1, 2008, except as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities



that
are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis as allowed under the FSP.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,

"The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"
(

"FAS 159"). Under FAS 159, a company may elect to measure eligible financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items
for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We
adopted FAS 159 effective January 1, 2008, but did not elect to measure any additional financial assets or liabilities at fair value.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued revised Statement No. 141, "

Business Combinations"

("FAS 141(R)"). FAS 141(R)
establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Generally, assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction will be recorded at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. FAS 141(R) will also change the accounting treatment
and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination. Transaction costs associated with the acquisition will be expensed upon close of the acquisition. FAS 141(R) applies
proactively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. FAS141(R) will be applied to
all acquisitions with closing dates after December 31, 2008.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, "

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—An Amendment of ARB
No. 51"

("FAS 160"). FAS 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary
and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. FAS 160 requires a company to clearly identify and present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the
consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company's equity. FAS 160 also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to
the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as
equity transactions. FAS 160 requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests, with all other requirements applied prospectively. As
of December 31, 2008 and 2007, minority interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were $61,299 and $64,982, respectively. These amounts will be recharacterized as
non-controlling interests as a component of equity when FAS 160 is adopted. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, "

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

" an amendment
of FASB Statement No. 133,

"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"

("FAS 161"). FAS 161 changes the
disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures stating how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how
derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation.
FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. FAS 161 also
encourages but does not require comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. We are currently evaluating the extent of the footnote disclosures required by FAS 161 and the
impact, if any, that it will have on our financial statements.

In
December 2007, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 110, which was effective January 1, 2008, and amends and replaces SAB No. 107,
"

Share-Based Payment.

" SAB No. 110 expresses the views of the SEC staff regarding the use of a "simplified" method in developing an



estimate
of expected term of "plain vanilla" share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R),

"Share-Based Payment."

Under the "simplified"
method, the expected term is calculated as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the option. The use of the "simplified" method, which was first described in SAB
No. 107, was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2007. SAB No. 110 extends the use of the "simplified" method for "plain vanilla" awards in certain situations. The SEC staff does
not expect the "simplified" method to be used when sufficient information regarding exercise behavior, such as historical exercise data or exercise information from external sources, becomes
available. The adoption of SAB No. 110 did not have a significant effect on our financial statements.

In
May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Position No. APB 14-1, "

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash
upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)"

("FSP APB 14-1"). Under FSP APB 14-1, entities with convertible debt instruments that
may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion should
separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of the adoption FSP APB 14-1
on the Company's exchangeable senior notes is that the equity component will be included in the paid-in-capital section of stockholders' equity on the consolidated balance
sheet and the value of the equity component will be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component. The original issue discount will be amortized over the period
of the debt as additional interest expense. FSP APB 14-1 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and for interim periods within those fiscal
years, with retrospective application required. We expect an annual increase of approximately $4,500 of non-cash interest expense as a result of the adoption of FSP
APB 14-1.

In
April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 142-3, "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets" ("FSP SFAS No. 142-3").
FSP SFAS No. 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142,

"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."

This new guidance applies prospectively to
intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP SFAS No. 142-3 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008, and early adoption is prohibited. The impact of FSP SFAS No. 142-3 will depend upon the nature, terms, and size of the acquisitions that we
consummate after the effective date.

In
June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-6-1,

"Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
Transactions Are Participating Securities,"

("FSP EITF 03-6-1"). FSP EITF 03-6-1 provides that unvested
share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of
earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method as described in FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,

"Earnings per
Share."

FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier
adoption is prohibited. We are required to adopt FSP EITF 03-6-1 in the first quarter of 2009 and do not believe that it will have a material affect on our financial
statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008 to the Year Ended December 31, 2007

of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2007, which included operations of 606 properties (262 of which
were consolidated and 344 of which were in joint ventures accounted for



using

Property Rental—

The increase in property rental revenues consists of $24,437 associated with acquisitions completed in 2008
and 2007, $2,782 associated with rental rate increases at stabilized properties and $2,161 from increases in occupancy and rental rates at lease-up properties.

Management and Franchise Fees—

Our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc., manages properties owned by
our joint ventures, franchisees and third parties. Management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash collected from properties owned by third party, franchisees and unconsolidated joint ventures.
Revenues from management and franchise fees have remained fairly stable compared to the previous year. Increased revenues at our joint venture, franchise, and third-party managed sites related to
rental rate and occupancy increases have been partially offset by lost management fees due to the termination of certain management agreements mainly due to the acquisition of the managed properties.

Tenant Reinsurance—

The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues is due to the fact that during the year ended
December 31, 2008, we promoted the tenant reinsurance program and successfully increased overall customer participation to approximately 47% at December 31, 2008 compared to
approximately 34% at December 31, 2007.

Other Income—

The decrease in other income is primarily due a decrease in development fee revenues earned because of a decrease
in the volume of development relating to joint ventures in 2008 compared to 2007.

Property Operations—

The increase in property operations expense in 2008 was primarily due to increases
of $9,146 associated with acquisitions completed in 2008 and 2007. There were also increases in expenses of $2,306 at existing properties primarily due to increases in repairs and maintenance,
utilities and property taxes.

Tenant Reinsurance—

The increase in tenant reinsurance expense is due to the increase in tenant reinsurance revenues during
2008. A large portion of tenant reinsurance expense is variable and increases as tenant reinsurance revenues increase. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we continued to promote the
tenant reinsurance program and successfully increased overall customer participation to approximately 47% at December 31, 2008 compared to approximately 34% at December 31, 2007.

General and Administrative—

The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to the increased costs associated with
the management of the additional properties that have been added through acquisitions and development in 2008 and 2007.

Depreciation and Amortization—

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is a result of additional properties that
have been added through acquisition and development throughout 2008 and 2007.

Interest Expense—

The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due primarily to $3,191
associated with mortgage loans on acquisitions completed in 2007. The increase was partially offset by lower interest costs on existing property debt. Capitalized interest during the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $5,506 and $4,555, respectively.

Interest Income—

Interest income earned in 2008 was primarily due to interest on the net proceeds from the sales of common
stock in May and October 2008. Interest income earned in 2007 was mainly the result of the interest earned on the net proceeds received from the $250,000 exchangeable senior notes issued in March 2007
and on the remaining net proceeds from the sale of
common stock in September 2006. Invested cash decreased steadily throughout 2007 as the funds were used for operations, acquisitions and development.



Interest Income on note receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership unit holder—

Represents interest on a $100,000 loan to
the holder of the Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred units of our Operating Partnership (the "Preferred OP units"). The funds were loaned on June 25, 2007 and bear interest at
an annual rate of 4.85%, payable quarterly.

Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Ventures—

The change in equity in earnings of real estate ventures for the year ended
December 31, 2008 primarily relates to an increase of $1,098 from our purchase of an additional 40% interest in the VRS Self Storage LLC joint venture on July 1, 2008. The
remainder of the change is a result of an increase in income at the properties owned by the real estate ventures. The increases were partially offset by the losses on certain lease-up
properties held in joint ventures.

Gain on Repurchase of Exchangeable Senior Notes—

Represents the gain on the repurchase of $40,337 principal amount of the
Operating Partnership's exchangeable senior notes. The Company paid cash of $31,721 and wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $646, resulting in a gain of $7,970.

Loss on Sale of Investments Available for Sale—

Represents the amount of loss recorded on February 29, 2008 related to
the liquidation of auction rate securities held in investments for sale.

Impairment of Investments Available for Sale—

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had a $24,460 par value investment in
ARS. Due to the uncertainty in the credit markets, the auctions related to the ARS held by the Company failed causing the liquidity and the fair value of these investments to be impaired. As a result,
the Company recorded a $1,233 other-than-temporary impairment charge and a $1,415 temporary impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the ARS to an estimated fair value
of $21,812.

Fair Value Adjustment of Obligation Associated with Preferred Operating Partnership Units—

This amount is a
one-time adjustment that represents the change in fair value of the embedded derivative associated with the Preferred OP units issued in connection with the AAAAA
Rent-a-Space acquisition between the original issuance
of the Preferred OP units (June and August, 2007) and the completion of the amendment to the agreement that was signed on September 28, 2007.

Minority Interest—Preferred Operating Partnership—

Income allocated to the Preferred Operating Partnership equals
the fixed distribution paid to the Preferred OP unit holder plus 1.09% of the remaining net income allocated after the adjustment for the fixed distribution paid for the year ended December 31,
2008. The amount allocated to minority interest was higher in 2008 than in 2007 as the Preferred OP units were issued in June and August 2007.

Minority Interest—Operating Partnership and Other—

Income allocated to the Operating Partnership represents 4.69%
of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the Preferred OP unit holder. The decrease in the amount allocated to the minority interest—Operating Partnership was
due to a full year of fixed distribution being paid to the Preferred Operating Partnership in 2008. Income allocated to other minority interests represents the losses allocated to partners in
consolidated joint ventures on four properties that were in lease-up during 2008. The amount allocated to the minority interest—other was higher than the prior year as there
were only two consolidated joint venture properties in lease-up for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2007 to the Year Ended December 31, 2006

Results for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the operations of 606 properties (262 of which were consolidated and 344
of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2006, which included operations of 567 properties (219 of which
were consolidated and 348 of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method). Results for both periods also included equity in earnings of real estate ventures, third-party
management and franchise fees, and other income.

all wholly-owned properties in October 2006. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we promoted the tenant reinsurance program and successfully increased overall customer
participation to approximately 34% at December 31, 2007 compared to approximately 18% at December 31, 2006.

Interest Expense—

The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to $6,897
associated with the exchangeable notes issued in March 2007 and $5,267 of interest expense on the mortgage loans associated with acquisitions completed in 2007 and 2006. The increase was offset by
lower interest costs on corporate borrowings and existing property debt. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $4,555 and $3,232, respectively.

Interest Income—

Interest income earned in 2007 was mainly the result of the interest earned on the net proceeds received from
the $250,000 exchangeable senior notes issued in March 2007 and on the remaining net proceeds from the sale of stock in September 2006. Invested cash decreased steadily throughout 2007 as the funds
were used for acquisitions and development.

Interest Income on note receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership unit holder—

Represents interest on a $100,000 loan to
the holder of the Preferred OP units. The funds were loaned on June 25, 2007 and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.85%, payable quarterly.

Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Ventures—

The change in equity in earnings of real estate ventures for the year ended
December 31, 2007 relates to increases in income at the properties owned by the real estate ventures. The increases were partially offset by the losses on certain lease-up
properties held in joint ventures.



Fair Value Adjustment of Obligation Associated with Preferred Operating Partnership units—

This amount is a
one-time adjustment that represents the change in fair value of the embedded derivative associated with the Preferred OP units issued in connection with the AAAAA
Rent-a-Space acquisition between the original issuance of the Preferred OP units (June and August, 2007) and the completion of the amendment to the agreement that was signed on
September 28, 2007.

Impairment of Investments Available for Sale—

As of December 31, 2007, we had a $24,460 par value investment in ARS. Due
to the uncertainty in the credit markets, the auctions related to the ARS held by us have failed causing the liquidity and the fair value of these investments to be impaired. As a result, we recorded
a $1,233 other-than-temporary impairment charge and a $1,415 temporary impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the ARS to an estimated fair value of $21,812.

Minority Interest—Preferred Operating Partnership—

Income allocated to the Preferred Operating Partnership equals
the fixed distribution paid to the Preferred OP unit holder plus 1.42% of the remaining net income allocated after the adjustment for the fixed distribution paid for the year ended December 31,
2007. The amount allocated to minority interest was higher than in the prior year as the Preferred Operating Partnership units were issued in June and August 2007.

Minority Interest—Operating Partnership and Other—

Income allocated to the Operating Partnership represents 5.73%
of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the Preferred OP unit holder. The decrease in the amount allocated to the minority interest—Operating Partnership was
due to the creation of the Preferred Operating Partnership units in 2007. Income allocated to other minority interests represents the losses allocated to partners in consolidated joint ventures on two
properties that were in lease-up during 2007.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

FFO provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash
flows, for an understanding of our operating results. We believe FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings because net earnings assumes that the values of real estate assets
diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. We believe that the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and FFO more accurately
reflects the value of our real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ("NAREIT") as net income computed in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with
GAAP, as presented in the consolidated financial statements.

The
computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that
interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative
to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash



distributions.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008 to the Year Ended December 31, 2007

The increase in same-store rental revenues was primarily due to increased rental rates to existing tenants which offset
lower rental rates to new tenants and a slight reduction in occupancy due to increased move-out activity.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2007 to the Year Ended December 31, 2006

The increase in same-store rental revenues was primarily due to increased rental rates to new and existing tenants and our
ability to maintain occupancy. The increase in same-store operating expenses was due to an increase in repairs and maintenance, insurance and property taxes.



CONTINGENT CONVERSION SHARES ("CCS") AND CONTINGENT CONVERSION UNITS ("CCU") PROPERTY PERFORMANCE

Upon the achievement of certain levels of net operating income with respect to 14 of our properties, our CCSs and our Operating
Partnership's CCUs converted into additional shares of common stock and OP units, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2008, an aggregate of 2,801,053 CCSs and 144,089 CCUs had converted to common stock and OP units, respectively. Based on the performance of the properties as of
December 31, 2008, no additional CCSs and CCUs became eligible for conversion during the fourth quarter. The remaining unconverted 1,087,790 CCSs and 55,957 CCUs were cancelled as of
February 4, 2009.

The
table below outlines the performance of the properties for the three months and years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively and for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008 to the Year Ended December 31, 2007

The increase in rental revenues was primarily due to increased rental rates to new and existing tenants and our ability to maintain
occupancy. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in property tax expense from the prior year.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2007 to the Year Ended December 31, 2006

The increase in revenues was primarily due to increased rental rates to new and existing tenants and increases in occupancy. The
decrease in same-store operating expenses was due to a property tax adjustment from prior years.

CASH FLOWS

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008 to the Year Ended December 31, 2007

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $96,664 and $101,332 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. This decrease was due mainly to an increase in the cash paid on behalf of affiliated joint ventures and related parties during 2008 compared to 2007, which resulted in an increase in
receivables from related parties. Additionally, more cash was spent to acquire other assets in 2008 when compared to 2007. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in cash due to the
acquisition of new stabilized properties in 2008 and 2007.

Cash
used in investing activities was $222,754 and $253,579 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2008 was primarily the result of $56,397
less cash being used to



fund
acquisition activities and the collection of $21,812 of cash from the sale of the Company's investments available for sale, compared to a payment of $24,460 to purchase investments available for
sale in 2007. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $18,708 in development activities and an increase of $39,223 invested in real estate ventures when compared to the prior year.

Cash
provided by financing activities was $172,685 and $98,823 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in cash provided in 2008 was due
primarily to proceeds from issuance of common stock of $276,601 in 2008 compared to $0 in 2007, and no cash was loaned to the Preferred OP unit holder in 2008 when compared to the prior year. These
increases were offset primarily by the decrease of $250,000 of proceeds from exchangeable senior notes, as no new notes were issued in 2008.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2007 to the Year Ended December 31, 2006

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $101,332 and $76,885 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to the addition through acquisition of new stabilized properties. In addition, the increase was also a result of the
collection of receivables from affiliated joint ventures and related parties and the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses as a result of normal operations.

Cash
used in investing activities was $253,579 and $239,778 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2007 is primarily the result of the
additional cash being used to fund acquisition and development activities.

Cash
provided by financing activities was $98,823 and $205,041 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2007 was due to an increase in net
borrowings and notes payable (net of principal payments) of $207,795 that was offset by a loan to a Preferred OP unit holder of $100,000 in 2007. Net proceeds from share issuances of $194,474 were
received in 2006 compared to $0 in 2007.

2008 OPERATIONAL SUMMARY

Our 2008 operating results were positive with increases in both revenues and net operating income. On a same-store basis
(excluding tenant reinsurance revenues), revenue increased 1.6% and NOI increased 2.3%. Same-store expense control was excellent, with a year-on-year increase of a
modest 0.3%. Revenue increases were driven mostly by rate growth to existing tenants, as year-end same-store occupancy decreased to 82.5% as compared to 84.2% the previous
year.

The
markets of Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston and San Francisco/Oakland were top performers with year-on-year revenue growth at stabilized properties. Markets
performing below the portfolio average in year-on-year revenue growth included Indianapolis, Memphis, Miami, Phoenix and West Palm Beach. Properties in markets throughout
Florida continue to perform below the portfolio average.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $63,972 available in cash and cash equivalents. We intend to use this cash to
repay debt scheduled to mature in 2009 and for general corporate purposes. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders on an
annual basis to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Recently issued guidance from the IRS allows for up to 90% of a REIT's dividends to be paid with its common stock in 2009 if certain conditions
are met. We will continue to review our dividend payment policy on a quarterly basis and may consider a reduction in our dividend distribution and/or payment of our dividend distribution using a
combination of cash and our common stock. It is unlikely that we will



have
any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs. Instead, these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital.

Our
cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. During 2008 we
experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents; however, there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the
financial markets.

On
October 19, 2007, we entered into a $100,000 Credit Line. We intend to use the proceeds of the Credit Line to repay debt scheduled to mature in 2009 and for general corporate
purposes. The Credit Line has an interest rate of between 100 and 205 basis points over LIBOR, depending on certain of our financial ratios. The Credit Line is collateralized by mortgages on certain
real estate assets. The Credit Line matures on October 31, 2010 with two one-year extensions available. Outstanding balances on the Credit Line at December 31, 2008 and 2007
were $27,000 and $0, respectively.

On
October 4, 2004, we entered into a reverse interest rate swap (the "Swap Agreement") with U.S. Bank National Association, relating to our existing $61.8 million fixed
rate mortgage with Wachovia Bank, which is due in 2009. Pursuant to the Swap Agreement, we will receive fixed interest payments of 4.3% and pay variable interest payments based on the
one-month LIBOR plus 0.7% on a notional amount of $61.8 million. There were no origination fees or other up front costs incurred by us in connection with the Swap Agreement.

As
of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $1,299,851 of debt, resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 58.0%. As of December 31, 2008, the ratio of total
fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 88.3% ($61,770 on which we have a reverse interest rate swap has been
included as variable rate debt). The weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at December 31, 2008 was 4.7%.

Certain
of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt. We are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt. We were in compliance with all
covenants at December 31, 2008.

We
expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of
OP units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Line. In addition, the Company is actively pursuing additional term
loans secured by unencumbered properties.

Our
liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders, new facility development, property acquisitions, principal payments under our borrowings and
non-recurring capital expenditures. In addition, we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships, which may require us to raise additional
funds. We do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured
indebtedness, joint ventures with third parties, and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt. In addition, we will continue to review our dividend payment policy on a
quarterly basis and may consider a reduction in our dividend distribution and/or payment of our dividend distribution using our common stock. Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable
to us or at all. Any additional issuance of equity or equity-linked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and
privileges senior to holders of our common stock. We may also use OP units as currency to fund acquisitions from self-storage owners who desire tax-deferral in their exiting
transactions.



The
U.S. credit markets are experiencing significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These
circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of
debt financing. Continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and fund current and future development projects. In addition, the financial
condition of the lenders of our credit facilities may worsen to the point that they default on their obligations to make available to us the funds under those facilities. A prolonged downturn in the
credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it
more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may
experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. These events in the credit markets have also had an adverse affect on other financial markets in the United
States, which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities. These disruptions in the financial market
may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally, which could cause our stock price to decline.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities
or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we have not guaranteed any
obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market
or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.

Our
exchangeable senior notes provide for excess exchange value to be paid in shares of our common stock if our stock price exceeds a certain amount. See the notes to our financial
statements for a further description of our exchangeable senior notes.

FINANCING STRATEGY

We will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors. Although
our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time
to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate. In making financing decisions, we will consider factors including but not limited
to:

•

the interest rate of the proposed financing;

•

the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties;

•

prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing;

•

the purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing;

•

long-term objectives with respect to the financing;

•

target investment returns;

•

the ability of particular properties, and our Company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt
service payments;

•

overall level of consolidated indebtedness;

•

timing of debt and lease maturities;

•

provisions that require recourse and cross-collateralization;

•

corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets;
and

•

the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt.

Our
indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse or cross-collateralized. If the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular
properties to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties, or may refinance
properties acquired on a leveraged basis. We may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing properties,
for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable.

During
October 2008, we repurchased $40,337 million in aggregate principal amount of our exchangeable senior notes on the open market for $31,721 in cash. We may from time to time
seek to retire, repurchase or redeem our additional outstanding debt including our exchangeable senior notes as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately
negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The
amounts involved may be material.

SEASONALITY

The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from
May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter
may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.



Item 7a.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future income, cash flows and fair
values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international
economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control.

As
of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $1.3 billion in total debt of which approximately $152.4 million was subject to variable interest rates (including the
approximately $61.8 million on which we have the reverse interest rate swap). If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the
variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.5 million annually.

Interest
rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change
in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty
of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.

The
aggregate fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at December 31, 2008 was $1.1 billion. The carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable
and notes payable to trusts at December 31, 2008 was $937.8 million. The fair value of the exchangeable senior notes at December 31, 2008 was $131.0 million. The carrying
value of the exchangeable senior notes at December 31, 2008 was $209.7 million.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Extra Space Storage Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Extra Space Storage Inc. and subsidiaries ("the Company") as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the index at Item 8. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2008 and
2007 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Extra Space Storage Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2008

(Dollars in thousands, except share
data)

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business

Extra Space Storage Inc. (the "Company") is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment
trust ("REIT"), formed as a Maryland Corporation on April 30, 2004 to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop self-storage facilities located throughout the United
States. The Company continues the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries (the "Predecessor"), which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. The
Company's interest in its properties is held through its operating partnership, Extra Space Storage LP (the "Operating
Partnership"), which was formed on May 5, 2004. The Company's primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred
to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). To the extent the
Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be subject to tax, with certain exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.

The
Company invests in self-storage facilities by acquiring or developing wholly-owned facilities or by acquiring an equity interest in real estate entities. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had direct and indirect equity interests in 627 storage facilities located in 33 states, and Washington, D.C. In addition, the Company managed 67 properties for
franchisees or third parties bringing the total number of properties which it owns and/or manages to 694.

The
Company operates in two distinct segments: (1) property management, acquisition and development; and (2) rental operations. The Company's property management,
acquisition and development activities include managing, acquiring, developing and selling self-storage facilities. The rental operations activities include rental operations of
self-storage facilities. No single tenant accounts for more than 5% of rental income.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly or majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The
Company follows FASB Interpretation No. 46R, "

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

" ("FIN 46R"), which addresses
the consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs"). Under FIN 46R, arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as VIEs. An enterprise is
required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

Under
FIN 46R, a VIE is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity's equity holders as a group either: (a) lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or
similar rights, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if



Extra Space Storage Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31, 2008

(Dollars in thousands, except share data)

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

they
occur. If an entity is deemed to be a VIE pursuant to FIN 46R, the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns
of the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.

Based
on the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company has concluded that under certain circumstances when the Company (1) enters into option agreements for the purchase of land
or facilities from an entity and pays a non-refundable deposit, or (2) enters into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (i),
(ii) (b) or (c) of the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, the Company has considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as
outlined in FIN 46R. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with the Company's financial
statements. Additionally, the Company's Operating Partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are VIEs under condition (ii) (a) above. Since the Operating Partnership is not the
primary beneficiary of the trusts, these VIEs are not consolidated.

The
Company's investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control and joint ventures which are VIEs in which the Company is not the
primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Long lived assets held for use are evaluated by the Company for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an
impairment. When such an event occurs, the Company compares the carrying value of these long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An
impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess
of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset. Management has determined no property was impaired and no impairment charges have been recognized for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

When
real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value of the assets, net of selling costs.
If the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, then a valuation allowance is established. The
operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Management has determined no property was held for sale at
December 31, 2008.

The
Company assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company's investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired when events or circumstances
indicate that there may be an impairment. An investment is impaired if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred,
and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. No impairment charges were recognized
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

There
were no impaired properties or investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures or any real estate assets identified as held for sale during the year ended December 31,
2008. Therefore, the Company did not make any nonrecurring fair value measurements during the period.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other financial instruments included in other assets, accounts payable
and accrued expenses, variable rate notes payable, line of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007 approximate fair value. The
fair value of the note receivable to the Preferred OP unit holder at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $124,024 and $108,915, respectively. The carrying value of the note receivable to the
Preferred OP unit holder at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $100,000 and $100,000 respectively. The aggregate fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at
December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1,062,949 and $968,519, respectively. The carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was
$937,756 and $944,916, respectively. The fair value of our exchangeable senior notes at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $131,039 and $286,947, respectively. The carrying value of the
exchangeable senior notes at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $209,663 and $250,000, respectively.

Real Estate Assets

Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated with the
development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction
period are capitalized. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $5,506, $4,555 and $3,232, respectively.

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are
generally between five and 39 years.

In
connection with the Company's acquisition of properties, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values. The
value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, are determined as if vacant, that is, at replacement cost. Intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant
relationships, are recorded at their
fair values. The Company measures the value of tenant relationships based on the Company's historical experience with turnover in its facilities. The Company amortizes to expense the tenant
relationships on a straight-line basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility (currently estimated to be 18 months).

Intangible
lease rights represent: (1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are
amortized to expense over the life of the leases and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on four properties where the leases were assumed by the Company at rates that were lower than the
current market rates for similar leases. The value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the lease terms.

Investments in Real Estate Ventures

The Company's investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control and joint
ventures which are VIEs in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Under
the equity method, the Company's investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for the Company's share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions.
Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on the Company's ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the purposes of
presentation in the statement of cash flows, the Company follows the "look through" approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported
under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the
proceeds from the joint venture's sale of assets) in which case it is reported as an investing activity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company's cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States of America and at times may exceed
federally insured limits. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Investments Available for Sale

The Company accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities according to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

," which requires securities classified as
"available for sale" to be stated at fair value. Adjustments to the fair value of available for sale securities are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. A decline in the fair value
of investment securities below cost, that is deemed to be other than temporary, results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis
for the security is established. The Company classified its investments in auction rate securities as investments available for sale in the accompanying balance sheet. These investments were carried
at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive deficit. Unrealized losses that were other-than-temporary were recognized in
earnings. The Company had no investments available for sale as of December 31, 2008.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash is comprised of escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions located in various states relating to earnest
money deposits on potential acquisitions, real estate taxes, insurance, capital expenditures and lease liabilities.

Other Assets

Other assets consist primarily of equipment and fixtures, deferred financing costs, customer accounts receivable, investments in
trusts, other intangible assets, deferred tax assets and prepaid expenses. Depreciation of equipment and fixtures is computed on a straight-line basis over three to five years. Deferred
financing costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective debt agreements.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS No. 133, "

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

," as
amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the
intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular
risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For
derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in the statements of
operations. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income, outside of
earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.

Risk Management and Use of Financial Instruments

In the normal course of its on-going business operations, the Company encounters economic risk. There are three main
components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its interest-bearing liabilities. Credit risk is the risk of inability or
unwillingness of tenants to make contractually required payments. Market risk is the risk of declines in the value of properties due to changes in rental rates, interest rates or other market factors
affecting the value of properties held by the Company. The Company has entered into Swap Agreements to manage a portion of its interest rate risk.

Conversion of Operating Partnership Units

Conversions of Operating Partnership units to common stock, when converted under the original provisions of the agreement, are
accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-7,
"

Implementation Issues Related to the Treatment of Minority Interest in Certain Real Estate Investment Trusts

."

Revenue and Expense Recognition

Rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally on
month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line

basis
over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period. Late charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck
rentals are recognized as income when earned. Management and franchise fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the management agreements.
Tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage. Equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of
each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. Interest income is recognized as earned.

Property
expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. The Company accrues for property tax
expense based upon estimates and historical trends. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected.

Real Estate Sales

The Company evaluates real estate sales for both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 66, "

Accounting for Sales of Real Estate

." In general, sales of real estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration
has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition; other forms of continuing
involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition.

Advertising Costs

The Company incurs advertising costs primarily attributable to directory, direct mail, internet and other advertising. Direct response
advertising costs are deferred and amortized over the expected benefit period determined to be 12 months. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company recognized $5,540,
$5,047 and $4,960 in advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to
maintain its qualification as a REIT, among other things, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature
of its income and assets. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to
stockholders. The Company plans to continue to operate so that it meets the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If the Company
were to fail to meet these requirements, it would be subject to federal income tax. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in property
operating and general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2008, 35.0% (unaudited) of all distributions to
stockholders qualifies as a return of capital.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

The Company has elected to treat one of its corporate subsidiaries, Extra Space Management, Inc., as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). In general, the Company's TRS may perform
additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or management of health care facilities or any
lodging facilities or the provision to any person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, of rights to any brand name under which lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A TRS is
subject to corporate federal income tax. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 109, "

Accounting for Income
Taxes"

("FAS 109"). Under FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities.

The
Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, "

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes"

("FIN 48"),
an interpretation of FAS 109, on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized
income tax benefits. At the adoption date of January 1, 2007, there were no material unrecognized tax benefits. At December 31, 2007 and 2008, there were also no material unrecognized
tax benefits.

Interest
and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized as income tax expense when incurred. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no interest or
penalties related to uncertain tax provisions.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "

Share-Based
Payment

," ("SFAS 123R"), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on
estimated fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes SFAS No. 123, "

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

" and Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, "

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

" ("APB 25"). The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective
application method of adoption which requires the Company to record compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the unamortized grant
date fair value of these awards over their remaining service period with no change in historical reported earnings. Awards granted after December 31, 2005 are valued at fair value in accordance
with provisions of SFAS 123R and recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. The forfeiture rate, which is estimated at a weighted average of 19.72% of unvested
options outstanding as of December 31, 2008, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.

Net Income Per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding, less
non-vested restricted stock. Diluted earnings per common share measures the performance of the Company over the reporting period while giving effect to all potential common shares that
were dilutive and outstanding during the period. The denominator includes the



Extra Space Storage Inc.

(Dollars in thousands, except share data)

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

weighted
average number of basic shares and the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares that were dilutive had been issued and is calculated
using either the treasury stock or if-converted method. Potential common shares are securities (such as options, warrants, convertible debt, Contingent Conversion Shares ("CCSs"),
Contingent Conversion Units ("CCUs"), exchangeable Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Operating Partnership units ("Preferred OP units") and exchangeable Operating Partnership units
("OP units")) that do not have a current right to participate in earnings but could do so in the future by virtue of their option or conversion right. In computing the dilutive effect of convertible
securities, net income is adjusted to add back any changes in earnings in the period associated with the convertible security. The numerator also is adjusted for the effects of any other
non-discretionary changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares. In computing diluted earnings per share, only potential common
shares that are dilutive, those that reduce earnings per share, are included.

The
Company's Operating Partnership has $209,663 of exchangeable senior notes issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2008 that also can potentially have a dilutive effect on
its earnings per share calculations. The exchangeable senior notes are exchangeable by holders into shares of the Company's common stock under certain circumstances per the terms of the indenture
governing the exchangeable senior notes. The exchangeable senior notes are not exchangeable unless the price of the Company's common stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable exchange
price for a specified period during a quarter, or unless certain other events occur. The exchange price was $23.45 per share at December 31, 2008, and could change over time as described in the
indenture. The price of the Company's common stock did not exceed 130% of the exchange price for the specified period of time during the fourth quarter of 2008, therefore holders of the exchangeable
senior notes may not elect to convert them during the first quarter of 2009.

The
Company has irrevocably agreed to pay only cash for the accreted principal amount of the exchangeable senior notes relative to its exchange obligations, but has retained the right to
satisfy the exchange obligations in excess of the accreted principal amount in cash and/or common stock. Though the Company has retained that right, FASB Statement No. 128,
"

Earnings Per Share,"

("FAS 128"), requires an assumption that shares will be used to pay the exchange obligations in excess of the accreted
principal amount, and requires that those shares be included in the Company's calculation of
weighted average common shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share computation. No shares were included in the computation at December 31, 2008 because there was no excess over the
accreted principal for the period.

For
the purposes of computing the diluted impact on earnings per share of the potential conversion of Preferred OP units into common shares, where the Company has the option to redeem in
cash or shares as discussed in Note 14 and where the Company has stated the positive intent and ability to settle at least $115,000 of the instrument in cash (or net settle a portion of the
Preferred OP units against the related outstanding note receivable), only the amount of the instrument in excess of $115,000 is considered in the calculation of shares contingently issuable for the
purposes of computing diluted earnings per share as allowed by paragraph 29 of FAS 128.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement No. 157,

"Fair
Value Measurements"

("FAS 157"). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value
measurements. FAS 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement of
Position No. 157-2,

"Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157"

(the "FSP"). The FSP amends FAS 157 to delay the
effective date for FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis. For items within that scope, the FSP defers the effective date of FAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

The
Company adopted FAS 157 effective January 1, 2008, except as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis as allowed under the FSP.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,

"The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"
(

"FAS 159"). Under FAS 159, a company may elect to measure eligible financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items
for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The
Company adopted FAS 159 effective January 1, 2008, but did not elect to measure any additional financial assets or liabilities at fair value.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued revised Statement No. 141, "

Business Combinations"

("FAS 141(R)"). FAS 141(R)
establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Generally, assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction will be recorded at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. FAS 141(R) will also change the accounting treatment
and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination. Transaction
costs associated with the acquisition will be expensed upon close of the acquisition. FAS 141(R) applies proactively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
beginning of the first fiscal year beginning on or after December 15, 2008. FAS141(R) will be applied to all acquisitions with closing dates after December 31, 2008.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, "

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—An Amendment of ARB
No. 51"

("FAS 160"). FAS 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. FAS 160 requires a company to clearly identify and present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated
financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company's equity. FAS 160 also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as
equity transactions. FAS 160 requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests, with all other requirements applied prospectively. As
of December 31, 2008 and 2007, minority interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were $61,299 and $64,982, respectively. These amounts will be recharacterized as
non-controlling interests as a component of equity when FAS 160 is adopted. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

In
March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, "

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

" an amendment
of FASB Statement No. 133,

"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"

("FAS 161"). FAS 161 changes the
disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures stating how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how
derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations; and how derivative instruments and

hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of
underlying risk and accounting designation. FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early
application encouraged. FAS 161 also encourages but does not require comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the extent of the
footnote disclosures required by FAS 161 and the impact, if any, that it will have on its financial statements.

In
December 2007, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 110, which was effective January 1, 2008, and amends and replaces SAB No. 107,
"

Share-Based Payment.

" SAB No. 110 expresses the views of the SEC staff regarding the use of a "simplified" method in developing an estimate of
expected term of "plain vanilla" share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R),

"Share-Based Payment."

Under the "simplified" method, the
expected term is calculated as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the option. The use of the "simplified" method, which was first described in SAB
No. 107, was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2007. SAB No. 110 extends the use of the "simplified" method for "plain vanilla" awards in certain situations. The SEC
staff does not expect the "simplified" method to be used when sufficient information regarding exercise behavior, such as historical exercise data or exercise information from external sources,
becomes available. The adoption of SAB No. 110 did not have a significant effect on the Company's financial statements.

In
May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Position No. APB 14-1, "

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash
upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)"

("FSP APB 14-1"). Under FSP APB 14-1, entities with convertible debt instruments that
may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic
interest cost. The effect of the adoption FSP APB 14-1 on the Company's exchangeable senior notes is that the equity component will be included in the
paid-in-capital section of stockholders' equity on the consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component will be treated as original issue discount for purposes
of accounting for the debt component. The original issue discount will be amortized over the period of the debt as additional interest expense. FSP APB 14-1 will be effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with retrospective application required. The Company expects an annual increase of
approximately $4,500 of non-cash interest expense as a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 based on the exchangeable senior notes outstanding at December 31, 2008.

In
April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 142-3, "

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets

" ("FSP SFAS No. 142-3"). FSP SFAS No. 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension
assumptions used in determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

." This new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset
acquisitions. FSP SFAS No. 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and early adoption is

In
June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-6-1, "

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
Transactions Are Participating Securities

," ("FSP EITF 03-6-1"). FSP EITF 03-6-1 provides that unvested
share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of
earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method as described in FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "

Earnings per

." FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier
adoption is prohibited. The Company is required to adopt FSP EITF 03-6-1 in the first quarter of 2009 and does not believe that it will have a material affect on its
financial statements.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 2007 and 2006 financial statements and supporting note disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not impact previously reported net income or accumulated deficit.

In
these joint ventures, the Company and the joint venture partner generally receive a preferred return on their invested capital. To the extent that cash/profits in excess of these
preferred returns are generated through operations or capital transactions, the Company would receive a higher percentage of the excess cash/profits than its equity interest.

On
July 1, 2008, the Company purchased an additional 40.0% interest in VRS Self Storage LLC from Prudential Real Estate Investors for cash of $44,100, resulting in an
increase in the Company's total interest in the joint venture from 5.0% to 45.0%.

On
March 1, 2007, the Company acquired a 39.5% interest in U-Storage de Mexico S.A., an existing Mexican corporation ("U-Storage"), which currently
manages, develops, owns and operates self storage facilities in Mexico. Kenneth T. Woolley, a former Senior Vice President of the Company and son of Kenneth M. Woolley, the CEO of the
Company, also acquired a 0.5% interest in U-Storage.

On
December 31, 2007, the Company acquired from Extra Space Development ("ESD"), a related party owned by certain members of management and a director, its ownership interest in
three joint ventures: Extra Space of Elk Grove LLC (70% ownership interest, a consolidated joint venture), Extra Space West Two LLC (5% ownership interest) and Storage Associates
Holdco LLC (10% ownership interest.) The excess profit participation is 10 - 50% for each joint venture. In addition to the joint venture interests, three wholly-owned
properties were purchased.

Variable Interests in Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures:

The Company has interests in two unconsolidated joint ventures with unrelated third parties ("Montrose" and "Eastern Avenue") which are
VIEs. The Company holds a 10% equity interest in Montrose and Eastern Avenue, but has 50% of the voting rights. Qualification as a VIE was based on the disproportionate voting and ownership
percentages. The Company performed a probability-based cash flow analysis for each of these joint ventures to determine which party was the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. These analyses were
performed using the Company's best estimates of the future cash flows based on its historical experience with numerous similar assets. As a result of these analyses, the Company determined that it was
not the primary beneficiary of either Montrose or Eastern Avenue as the Company does not receive a majority of either joint venture's expected residual returns or bear a majority of the expected
losses. Accordingly, these interests are accounted for using the equity method.

Montrose
and Eastern Avenue each own a single pre-stabilized self-storage property. These joint ventures are financed through a combination of (1) equity
contributions from the Company and its joint venture partners, (2) mortgage notes payable and (3) payables to the Company for working capital. The payables to the Company are generally
amounts owed for expenses paid on behalf of the joint ventures by the Company as manager. The Company performs management services for both the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except share data)

5. INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE VENTURES (Continued)

Montrose
and Eastern Avenue joint ventures in exchange for a management fee of approximately 6% of the gross rental revenues generated by the properties. The Company's joint venture partners can
replace the Company as manager of the properties upon written notice. The Company has not provided financial or other support during the periods presented to Montrose or Eastern Avenue that it was not
previously contractually obligated to provide.

As
of December 31, 2008, $0 and $0 for Montrose and Eastern Avenue, respectively were included in Investments in Real Estate on its consolidated balance sheet. No liability was
recorded associated with the Company's guarantee of the construction loans of Montrose or Eastern Avenue. The Company's maximum exposure to loss for each joint venture as of December 31, 2008
is the total of the guaranteed loan balance and the Company's investment balances in each joint venture. The following table
compares the liability balances and the maximum exposure to loss related to Montrose and Eastern Avenue as of December 31, 2008:

The
maximum exposure to loss above represents the full amount of the loan guaranteed by the Company plus payables to the Company. The Company believes that
the risk of having to perform on the guarantee is remote and therefore no liability has been recorded. However, repossessing and/or selling the self-storage facilities and land that
collateralize the loans could provide funds sufficient to reimburse the Company, and the Company believes that the risk of having to perform on the guarantees is remote.

Variable Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures

The Company has variable interests in three consolidated joint ventures with third parties (the "VIE JVs") which are VIEs. The VIE JVs
are financed through a combination of (1) equity contributions from the Company and its joint venture partners, (2) mortgage notes payable and (3) payables to the Company for
working capital. The payables to the Company are generally amounts owed for expenses paid on behalf of the joint ventures by the Company as manager. The Company owns 50% to 72% of the common equity
interests in the VIE JVs. The Company performed probability-based cash flow projections for each venture using the Company's best estimates of future revenues and expenses based on historical
experience with numerous similar assets. According to these analyses, the joint ventures were determined to be VIEs based on an assessment that the equity financing was inadequate to support
operations. The Company was also determined to be the primary beneficiary of each of the VIE JVs, as it receives the majority of the benefits and bears the majority of the expected losses of each as a
result of its majority ownership and the management agreements. Therefore, each of the VIE JVs are consolidated with the assets and liabilities of each joint venture

Except as disclosed above, the Company has not provided financial or other support during the periods presented to these VIEs that it was not
previously contractually obligated to provide. The Company has guaranteed the notes payable for these VIEs. If the joint ventures default on the loans, the Company may be forced to repay its portion
of the balance owed. However, repossessing and/or selling the self-storage facilities and land that collateralize the loans could provide funds sufficient to reimburse the Company, and the
Company believes that the risk of having to perform on the guarantees is remote.

6. INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE

The Company accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities according to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115,
"

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

," which requires securities classified as "available for sale" to be stated at fair
value. Adjustments to the fair value of available for sale securities are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. A decline in the market value of investment securities below cost, that
is deemed to be other than temporary, results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. The
Company's investments available for sale have generally consisted of non mortgage-backed auction rate securities ("ARS"). ARS are generally long-term debt instruments that provide
liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined calendar intervals, generally every 28 days. This mechanism allows existing
investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par.

At
December 31, 2007, the Company had $24,460 invested in non mortgage-backed ARS. Uncertainties in the credit markets had prevented the Company and other investors from
liquidating the holdings of auction rate securities in auctions for these securities because the amount of securities

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

6. INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE (Continued)

submitted
for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment
charge of $1,233 and a temporary impairment charge of $1,415, which reduced the carrying value of the Company's investments in ARS to an estimated fair value of $21,812 as of December 31, 2007.
On February 29, 2008, the Company liquidated its holdings of ARS for $21,812 in cash. As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized $1,415 of the amount that was previously classified
as a temporary impairment as a loss on sale of investments available for sale through earnings. The Company has not had investments in ARS since March 1, 2008.

Certain
real estate assets are pledged as collateral for the notes payable. The Company is subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to the outstanding notes payable. The Company
was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2008.

In
October 2004, the Company entered into a reverse interest rate swap agreement ("Swap Agreement") to float $61,770 of 4.30% fixed interest rate secured notes due in June 2009. Under
this Swap Agreement, the Company will receive interest at a fixed rate of 4.30% and pay interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.65%. The Swap Agreement matures at the same time the notes are
due. This Swap Agreement is a fair value hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, and the fair value of

the
Swap Agreement is recorded as an asset or liability, with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related note payable. Monthly variable interest payments are recognized as an
increase or decrease in interest expense.

The
estimated fair value of the Swap Agreement at December 31, 2008 was reflected as an other asset of $647. The estimated fair value of the Swap Agreement at December 31,
2007 was reflected as an other liability of $125. The fair value of the Swap agreement is determined through observable prices in active markets for identical agreements. For the year ended
December 31, 2008, the Company recorded a reduction to interest expense of $223 relating to the Swap Agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 interest expense was
increased by $1,032 and $802, respectively, as a result of the Swap Agreement.

On
August 31, 2007, as part of the acquisition of our partner's joint venture interest in seven properties, the Company assumed an interest rate cap agreement related to the
assumption of the loan on these properties. The Company has designated the interest rate cap agreement as a cash flow hedge of the interest payments resulting from an increase in the interest rate
above the rates designated in the interest rate cap agreement. The interest rate cap agreement will allow increases in interest payments based on an increase in the LIBOR rate above the capped rates
(5.19% from 1/1/07 to 12/31/07 and 5.48% from 1/1/08 to 12/31/08) on $23,340 of floating rate debt to be offset by the value of the interest rate cap agreement. The estimated fair value of the
interest rate cap at the assumption date was not material and no asset or liability was recorded. The fair value of the interest rate cap is determined through observable prices in active markets for
identical agreements. The interest rate cap expired on December 31, 2008.

On
June 30, 2008, the Company entered into a loan agreement in the amount of $64,530 secured by certain properties. As of December 31, 2008, $940 was drawn on the loan
balance. As part of the loan agreement, the Company agreed to draw down at least 50% of the loan amount by February 1, 2009 with the remainder to be drawn by March 31, 2009. The loan
bears interest at LIBOR plus 2%, and matures on June 30, 2011. On February 1, 2009, the Company drew $40,000 of the $63,590 available and expects to draw the remaining balance on
March 31, 2009.

9. NOTES PAYABLE TO TRUSTS

During July 2005, ESS Statutory Trust III (the "Trust III"), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, issued an
aggregate of $40,000 of preferred securities which mature on July 31, 2035. In addition, the Trust III issued 1,238 of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price
of $1,238. On July 27, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities of $41,238 were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership ("Note 3").
Note 3 has a fixed rate of 6.91% through July 31, 2010, and then will be payable at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.40% per annum. The interest on Note 3,
payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust III to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities may be redeemed by the Trust with no prepayment premium after
July 27, 2010.

During
May 2005, ESS Statutory Trust II (the "Trust II"), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership of the
Company, issued an aggregate of $41,000 of preferred securities which mature on June 30, 2035. In addition, the Trust II issued 1,269 of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for
a purchase price of $1,269. On May 24, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities of $42,269 were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership
("Note 2"). Note 2 has a fixed rate of 6.67%
through June 30, 2010, and then will be payable at a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.40% per annum. The interest on Note 2, payable quarterly, will be used by the
Trust II to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities may be redeemed by the Trust with no prepayment premium after June 30, 2010.

During
April 2005, ESS Statutory Trust I (the "Trust"), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership of the Company
issued an aggregate of $35,000 of trust preferred securities which mature on June 30, 2035. In addition, the Trust issued 1,083 of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a
purchase price of $1,083. On April 8, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred and common securities of $36,083 were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership
(the "Note"). The Note has a variable rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. The interest on the Note, payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust to pay dividends on the trust
preferred securities. The trust preferred securities may be redeemed by the Trust with no prepayment premium after June 30, 2010.

Under
FIN 46R, Trust, Trust II and Trust III are VIEs because the holders of the equity investment at risk (the trust preferred securities) do not have adequate decision making
ability over the trusts' activities because of their lack of voting or similar rights. Because the Operating Partnership's investment in the trusts' common securities was financed directly by the
trusts as a result of its loan of the proceeds to the Operating Partnership, that investment is not considered to be an equity investment at risk. The Operating Partnership's investment in the trusts
is not a variable interest because equity interests are variable interests only to the extent that the investment is considered to be at risk, and therefore the Operating Partnership cannot be the
primary beneficiary of the trusts. Since the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts, they have not been consolidated. A debt obligation has been recorded in the form of notes as
discussed above for the proceeds, which are owed to the Trust, Trust II, and Trust III by the Company. The Company has also recorded its investment in the trusts' common securities as other assets.

The
Company has not provided financing or other support during the periods presented to the trusts that it was not previously contractually obligated to provide. The Company's maximum
exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the trusts is equal to the total amount of the notes discussed above less the amounts of the Company's investments in the trusts' common
securities. The net amount is the notes payable that the trusts owe to third parties for their investments in the trusts' preferred securities. Following is a tabular comparison of the carrying
amounts of the liabilities the Company has

10. EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR NOTES

On March 27, 2007, our Operating Partnership issued $250,000 of its 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due April 1, 2027 (the "Notes"). Costs incurred to issue the Notes were
approximately $5,700. These costs are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over five years, which represents the estimated term of the Notes, and are included in other assets, net in
the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. The Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are fully guaranteed by the Company. Interest is
payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year until the maturity date of April 1, 2027. The Notes bear interest at 3.625% per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature,
which provides that the Notes may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash (up to the principal amount of the Notes) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, for cash, shares of
our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at an initial exchange rate of approximately 42.6491 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes at the option of the Operating
Partnership.

The
Operating Partnership may redeem the Notes at any time to preserve the Company's status as a REIT. In addition, on or after April 5, 2012, the Operating Partnership may redeem
the Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior written notice to holders
of the Notes.

The
holders of the Notes have the right to require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the Notes for cash, in whole or in part, on each of April 1, 2012, April 1, 2017
and April 1, 2022, and upon the occurrence of a designated event, in each case for a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Certain events are considered "Events of Default," as defined in the indenture governing the Notes, which may result in the accelerated maturity of the Notes.

The
Company has considered whether the exchange settlement feature represents an embedded derivative within the debt instrument under the guidance of FAS 133:
"

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"

EITF 90-19: "

Convertible Bonds with Issuer
Option to Settle for Cash Upon Conversion

," and EITF 01-6: "

The Meaning of "Indexed to a Company's Own Stock"

that would

10. EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR NOTES (Continued)

require
bifurcation (i.e., separate accounting). The Company has concluded that the exchange settlement feature has satisfied the exemption in SFAS 133 because it is indexed to the
Company's own common stock and would otherwise be classified in stockholders equity, among other considerations. Accordingly, the Notes are presented as a single debt instrument (often referred to as
"Instrument C" in EITF 90-19) in accordance with APB 14 "

Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase
Warrants"

due to the inseparability of the debt and the conversion feature.

During
October 2008, the Company repurchased $40,337 principal amount of the Notes on the open market. The Company paid cash of $31,721 to repurchase the Notes. The repurchase resulted
in a gain of $7,970 on early extinguishment of debt.

The
Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will have on its financial statements in 2009 and expects to have an approximate
increase of $4,500 in non-cash interest expense as a result of adoption. The gain on early extinguishment of debt relating to the repurchase of the Notes in October 2008 is also expected
to be reduced as a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1.

11. LINE OF CREDIT

On October 19, 2007, the Company entered into a $100,000 revolving line of credit (the "Credit Line") that matures October 31, 2010 with two one-year extensions
available. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the Credit Line to repay debt maturing in 2009 and for general corporate purposes. The Credit Line has an interest rate of between 100 and 205
basis points over LIBOR, depending on certain financial ratios of the Company. The Credit Line is collateralized by mortgages on certain real estate assets. As of December 31, 2008, the Credit
Line had $100,000 of capacity based on the assets collateralizing the Credit Line of which $27,000 was drawn. The Company is subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to the Credit Line. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2008. No amounts were outstanding on the Credit Line at December 31, 2007. On January 30, 2009, the Company drew an
additional $50,000 on the Credit Line.

13. RELATED PARTY AND AFFILIATED REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTIONS (Continued)

Centershift,
a related party service provider, is partially owned by a certain director and members of management of the Company. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company entered
into a license agreement with Centershift which secures a perpetual right for continued use of STORE (the site management software used at all sites operated by the Company) in all aspects of the
Company's property acquisition, development, redevelopment and operational activities. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company paid Centershift $989, $965 and $824,
respectively, relating to the purchase of software and to license agreements.

The
Company has entered into an aircraft dry lease and service and management agreement with SpenAero, L.C. ("SpenAero") an affiliate of Spencer F. Kirk, the Company's President. Under
the terms of the agreement, the Company pays a defined hourly rate for use of the aircraft. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company paid SpenAero $440, $395 and
$314, respectively. The services that the Company receives from SpenAero are similar in nature and price to those that are provided to other outside third parties.

The
Company has determined that it had a variable interest in properties in which ESD, a related party, owned or had an ownership interest. The Company did not have an equity investment
or interest in these properties. and it was not the primary beneficiary of the variable interests. This variable interest was a result of management and development contracts that were held by the
Company. The variable interest was limited to the management and development fees and there was not any additional loss that could be attributed to the Company. The Company determined that it was not
the primary beneficiary in these agreements. Accordingly, these properties were not consolidated between August 16, 2004 and December 31, 2007. On December 31, 2007, the Company
acquired ESD and its related assets for $46,674. The following assets were purchased as part of this transaction:

•

Three wholly-owned properties;

•

70% ownership interest in Extra Space of Elk Grove LLC, a consolidated joint venture that owns one property;

•

5% ownership interest in Extra Space West Two LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture that owns five properties; and

•

10% ownership interest Storage Associates Holdco LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture that owns six properties.

The
independent members of the Company's board of directors reviewed and approved the acquisition of ESD.

14. MINORITY INTEREST REPRESENTED BY PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS

On June 15, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a Contribution Agreement with various limited partnerships affiliated with AAAAA Rent-A-Space to
acquire ten self-storage facilities (the "Properties") in exchange for the issuance of newly designated Preferred OP units of the Operating Partnership. The self-storage
facilities are located in California and Hawaii.

14. MINORITY INTEREST REPRESENTED BY PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS (Continued)

On June 25 and 26, 2007, nine of the ten properties were contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for consideration totaling $137,800. Preferred OP units totaling
909,075, with a value of $121,700, were issued along with the assumption of approximately $14,200 of third-party debt, of which $11,400 was paid off at close. The final property was contributed on
August 1, 2007 in exchange for consideration totaling $14,700. 80,905 Preferred OP units with a value of $9,800 were issued along with $4,900 of cash.

On
June 25, 2007, the Company loaned the holder of the Preferred OP units $100,000. The note receivable bears interest at 4.85%, and is due September 1, 2017. The loan is
secured by the borrower's Preferred OP units. The holder of the Preferred OP units can convert up to 114,500 Preferred OP units prior to the maturity date of the loan. If any redemption in excess of
114,500 Preferred OP units occurs prior to the maturity date, the holder of the Preferred OP units is required to repay the loan as of the date of that Preferred OP unit redemption. Preferred OP units
are shown on the balance sheet net of the $100,000 loan under the guidance in EITF No. 85-1, "

Classifying Notes Receivable for
Capital,"

because the borrower under the loan receivable is also the holder of the Preferred OP units.

The
Operating Partnership entered into a Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement") which provides for the designation and issuance of the
Preferred OP units. The Preferred OP units will have priority over all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

Under
the Partnership Agreement, Preferred OP units in the amount of $115,000 bear a fixed priority return of 5% and have a fixed liquidation value of $115,000. The remaining balance
will participate in distributions with and have a liquidation value equal to that of the common Operating Partnership units. The Preferred OP units became redeemable at the option of the holder on
September 1, 2008, which redemption obligation may be satisfied, at the Company's option, in cash or shares of its common stock.

At
issuance, in accordance with SFAS 133: "

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"

, SFAS 150:

"Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity",

EITF 00-19:

"Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock",

EITF Topic D-109:
"

Determining the Nature of a Host Contract Related to a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share under FASB Statement No. 133":

and Accounting Series Release ("ASR") No. 268:

"Presentation in Financial Statements of "Redeemable Preferred Stocks",

from inception through
September 28, 2007 (the date of the amendment discussed below), the Preferred OP units were classified as a hybrid instrument such that the value of the units associated with the fixed return
were classified in mezzanine after total
liabilities on the balance sheet and before stockholders' equity. The remaining balance that participates in distributions equal to that of common OP units had been identified as an embedded
derivative and had been classified as a liability on the balance sheet and recorded at fair value on a quarterly basis with any adjustment being recorded through earnings. For the year ended
December 31, 2007, the fair value adjustment associated with the embedded derivative was $1,054.

14. MINORITY INTEREST REPRESENTED BY PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS (Continued)

On
September 28, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into an amendment to the Contribution Agreement (the "Amendment"). Pursuant to the Amendment, the maximum number of shares
that can be issued upon redemption of the Preferred OP units was set at 116 million, after which the Company will have no further obligations with respect to the redeemed or any other remaining
Preferred OP units. As a result of the Amendment, and in accordance with the above referenced guidance, the Preferred OP units are no longer considered a hybrid instrument and the previously
identified embedded derivative no longer requires bifurcation and is considered permanent equity of the Operating Partnership. The Preferred OP units are included on the consolidated balance sheet as
the minority interest represented by Preferred OP units, and no recurring fair value measurements are required subsequent to the date of the Amendment.

On
September 18, 2008, the Operating Partnership entered into a First Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership to clarify
tax-related provisions relating to the Preferred OP units.

15. MINORITY INTEREST IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

The Company's interest in its properties is held through the Operating Partnership. ESS Holding Business Trust I, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is the sole general partner of
the
Operating Partnership. The Company through ESS Business Trust II, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is also a limited partner of the Operating Partnership. Between its general partner and
limited partner interests, the Company held a 94.23% majority ownership interest therein as of December 31, 2008. The remaining ownership interests in the Operating Partnership (including
Preferred OP units) of 5.77% are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating Partnership, which include a director and officers of the Company. As of December 31, 2008,
the Operating Partnership had 4,264,968 and 55,957 OP units and CCUs outstanding, respectively.

The
minority interest in the Operating Partnership represents OP units that are not owned by the Company. In conjunction with the formation of the Company and as a result of subsequent
acquisitions, certain persons and entities contributing interests in properties to the Operating Partnership received limited partnership units in the form of either OP units or Contingent Conversion
units. Limited partners who received OP units in the formation transactions or in exchange for contributions for interests in properties have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem
part or all of their OP units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock (10 day average) at the time of the redemption.
Alternatively, the Company may, at its option, elect to acquire those OP units in exchange for shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to
anti-dilution adjustments provided in the Operating Partnership agreement. The ten day average closing stock price at December 31, 2008, was $9.99 and there were 4,264,968 OP units
outstanding. Assuming that all of the unit holders exercised their right to redeem all of their OP units on December 31, 2008 and the Company elected to pay the non-controlling
members cash, the Company would have paid $42,607 in cash consideration to redeem the units.

15. MINORITY INTEREST IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP (Continued)

During
October 2008, the Company issued 270,406 OP units valued at $3,623 in conjunction with the acquisition of four properties in Indianapolis, Indiana.

In
October 2008, 129,499 OP units were redeemed in exchange for the Company's common stock.

During
June 2007, the Company issued 218,693 OP units valued at $3,834 in conjunction with the acquisition of a property in San Francisco, California. 47,334 OP units were redeemed in
exchange for cash throughout 2007.

Unlike
the OP units, CCUs do not carry any voting rights. Upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to 14 properties, all or a portion of the CCUs will be
automatically converted into OP units. Initially, each CCU will be convertible on a one-for-one basis into OP units, subject to customary
anti-dilution adjustments. Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2006, and ending with the quarter ending December 31, 2008, the Company calculated the net operating
income from the 14 wholly-owned properties over the 12-month period ending in such quarter. Within 35 days following the end of each quarter referred to above, some or all of the
CCUs were converted so that the total percentage (not to exceed 100%) of CCUs issued in connection with the formation transactions that have been converted to OP units was equal to the percentage
determined by dividing the net operating income for such period in excess of $5,100 by $4,600. If any CCU remained unconverted through the calculation made in respect of the 12-month
period ending December 31, 2008, such outstanding CCUs would be cancelled.

While
any CCUs remain outstanding, a majority of the Company's independent directors must review and approve the net operating income calculation for each measurement period and also
must approve the sale of any of the 14 wholly-owned properties.

As
of December 31, 2008, 144,089 CCUs had converted to OP units. Based on the performance of the properties as of December 31, 2008, no additional CCUs became eligible for
conversion during the fourth quarter of 2008. The remaining 55,957 CCUs were cancelled as of February 4, 2009.

16. STOCKHOLDERS' AND MEMBERS' EQUITY

Stockholders' Equity

The Company's charter provides that it can issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, 4,100,000 CCSs,
$.01 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. As of December 31, 2008, 85,790,331 shares of
common stock were issued and outstanding, 1,143,747 CCSs were issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding.

the Company's shares of common stock, CCSs do not carry any voting rights. Upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to 14 properties, all or a portion of
the CCSs will be automatically converted into shares of the Company's common stock. Initially, each CCS will be convertible on a one-for-one basis into shares of common stock,
subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2006, and ending with the quarter ending December 31, 2008, the Company calculated
the net operating income from the 14 wholly-owned properties over the 12-month period ending in such quarter. Within 35 days following the end of each quarter referred to above,
some or all of the CCSs were converted so that the total percentage (not to exceed 100%) of CCSs issued in connection with the formation transactions that have been converted to common stock was equal
to the percentage determined by dividing the net operating income for such period in excess of $5,100 by $4,600. If any CCS remained unconverted through the calculation made in respect of the
12-month period ending December 31, 2008, such outstanding CCSs would be cancelled and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

While
any CCSs remain outstanding, a majority of the Company's independent directors must review and approve the net operating income calculation for each measurement period and also
must approve the sale of any of the 14 wholly-owned properties.

As
of December 31, 2008, 2,801,053 CCSs had converted to common stock. Based on the performance of the properties as of December 31, 2008, no additional CCSs became
eligible for conversion during the fourth quarter of 2008. The remaining 1,087,790 CCSs were cancelled and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock as of
February 4, 2009.

17. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company has the following two plans under which shares were available for grant at December 31, 2008: 1) the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan as
amended and restated, effective March 25, 2008, and 2) the 2004 Non-Employee Directors' Share Plan (together, the "Plans"). Option grants are issued with an exercise price
equal to the closing price of stock on the date of grant. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee at the time of grant, options shall vest ratably over a
four-year period beginning on the date of grant. Each option will be exercisable once it has vested. Options are exercisable at such times and subject to such terms as determined by the
Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee, but under no circumstances may be exercised if such exercise would cause a violation of the ownership limit in the Company's charter. Options expire
after 10 years from the date of grant.

17. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)

Also
as defined under the terms of the Plans, restricted stock grants may be awarded. The stock grants are subject to a performance or vesting period over which the restrictions are
released and the stock certificates are given to the grantee. During the performance or vesting period, the grantee is not permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or assign shares of restricted
stock granted under the Plans, however, the grantee has the ability to vote the shares and receive nonforfeitable dividends paid on shares. The forfeiture and transfer restrictions on the shares lapse
typically over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant. As of December 31, 2008, 4,701,745 shares were available for issuance under the Plans.

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total value (the difference between the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of 2008 and the exercise
price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on
December 31, 2008. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company's stock.

The
weighted average fair value of stock options granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $1.83, $2.34 and $1.78, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

For the Year Ended December 31,

Risk-free interest rate

Average expected term (years)




The
Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant
for the estimated life of the option. The Company uses actual historical data to calculate the expected price volatility, dividend yield and average expected term. The forfeiture rate, which is
estimated at a weighted-average of 19.72% of unvested options outstanding as of December 31, 2008, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are
expected to differ, from the previous estimates.

The
Company recorded compensation expense relating to outstanding options of $970, $865 and $798 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total cash
received for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to option exercises was $2,063, $1,735 and $934,
respectively. At December 31, 2008, there was $725 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options under the Company's 2004 Long-Term
Incentive Compensation Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.11 years. The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes subjective assumptions
that could potentially change over time, including the expected forfeiture rate. Therefore, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense at December 31, 2008, noted above does not
necessarily represent the expense that will ultimately be realized by the Company in the Statement of Operations.

17. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)

Common Stock Granted to Employees and Directors

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company granted 361,624, 120,729 and 62,300 shares respectively of
common stock to certain employees and directors, without monetary consideration under the Plans. Restricted stock granted typically vests over a four year period and is paid
non-forfeitable dividends during the term of the grant. The Company recorded $2,530, $1,260 and $927 of expense in general and administrative expense in its statement of operations related
to outstanding shares of common stock granted to employees and directors for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The forfeiture rate, which is estimated at a
weighted-average of 7.0% of unvested awards outstanding as of December 31, 2008, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from
the previous estimates. At December 31, 2008, there was $4,576 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards under the Company's 2004
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.81 years.

The
fair value of common stock awards is determined based on the closing trading price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The total fair value of the shares released for
the years ending December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $1,688, $982, and $908, respectively. A summary of the Company's employee and director share grant activity for the years ended

20. INCOME TAXES

As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which is distributed annually to its stockholders. However, the Company
has elected to treat one of its corporate subsidiaries, Extra Space Management, Inc., as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). In general, the Company's TRS may perform additional services for
tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the
provision to any person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, of rights to any brand name under which lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A TRS is subject to corporate federal
income tax. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of FAS 109. Under FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. There were no material deferred tax assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2007, and no material income tax provisions for
the years ended December 31, 2007 or 2006.

The
income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 is comprised of the following components:

The
Company had a release of its valuation allowance during 2008 from a prior year net operating loss related to the TRS of approximately $1,277. This reduction was offset by an
additional valuation allowance recorded that related to state income tax net operating losses that may not be utilized.

The
monthly rental amount for one of the ground leases is the greater of a minimum amount or a percentage of gross monthly receipts. The Company recorded rent expense of $2,262, $3,115
and $2,641 related to these leases in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The
Company has guaranteed two construction loans for unconsolidated partnerships that own development properties in Baltimore, Maryland, and Chicago, Illinois. These properties are
owned by joint ventures in which the Company has between 10% and 50% equity interests. These guarantees were entered into in November 2004 and July 2005, respectively. At
December 31, 2008, the total amount of guaranteed mortgage debt relating to these joint ventures was $12,851 (unaudited). These mortgage loans mature December 12, 2009 and,
July 28, 2009, respectively. If the joint ventures default on the loans, the Company may be forced to repay the loans. Repossessing and/or selling the self-storage facilities and
land that collateralize the loans could provide funds sufficient to reimburse

22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

the
Company. The estimated fair market value of the encumbered assets at December 31, 2008 is $17,507 (unaudited). The Company has recorded no liability in relation to this guarantee as of
December 31, 2008, as the fair value of the guarantee is not material. To date, the joint ventures have not defaulted on their mortgage debt. The Company believes the risk of having to perform
on the guarantee is remote.

The
Company has been involved in routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2008, the Company is not presently involved in any material
litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against its properties.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

(i)    Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures.

We
have a disclosure committee that is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure obligations of the Company on a timely basis. The
disclosure committee meets quarterly and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

(ii)    Internal Control over Financial Reporting

(a)    Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our
independent registered public accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP, has issued the following attestation report over our internal control over financial reporting.



(b)    Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Extra Space Storage Inc.

We have audited Extra Space Storage Inc. (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2008
and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the period ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 of Extra Space
Storage Inc. and our report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Lake City, Utah

February 24, 2009



(c)    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a- 15(f))
that occurred during our most recent quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B.    Other Information
