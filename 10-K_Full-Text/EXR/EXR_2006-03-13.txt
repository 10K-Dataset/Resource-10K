PART I

Item 1.    Business

General

Extra Space Storage Inc. ("we," "our," "us" or the "Company") is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust
("REIT") formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004 to own, operate, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage facilities. We closed our initial
public offering ("IPO") on August 17, 2004 (the "Offering Date"). Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "EXR."

We
were formed to continue the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries (the "Predecessor"), which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. These
companies were reorganized after the consummation of our IPO and various formation transactions. As of December 31, 2005, we held ownership interests in 546 properties located in 34 states,
including Washington D.C. with an aggregate of approximately 38 million square feet of net rentable space and greater than 275,000 customers. Of these 546 properties, 192 are wholly owned, and
354 are owned in joint-venture partnerships. An additional 85 properties are owned by franchisees or third parties and operated by us in exchange for a management fee.

We
operate in two distinct segments: (1) property management and development and (2) rental operations. Our property management and development activities include
acquiring, managing, developing and selling self-storage facilities. The rental operations activities include rental operations of self-storage facilities.

Substantially
all of our business is conducted through Extra Space Storage LP (the "Operating Partnership"), and through our wholly-owned Massachusetts business trust subsidiaries, our
primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. We have elected to be
taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). To the extent we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will not be subject to tax, with certain
exceptions, on our net taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders.

We
file our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). You may obtain copies of these documents by visiting the SEC's Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549,
by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 or by accessing the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable, after such materials
are furnished to the SEC, we make copies of these documents available to the public free of charge through our website at www.extraspace.com, or by contacting our Secretary at our principal offices,
which are located at 2795 Cottonwood Parkway, Suite 400, Salt Lake City, Utah 84121, telephone number (801) 562-5556.

Management

Members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the self-storage industry, and have an average of more than ten
years of industry experience. The senior management team has collectively acquired and/or developed more than 650 properties during the past 25 years for the Company, the Predecessor and other
entities. Kenneth M. Woolley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Richard S. Tanner, Senior Vice President Development, have worked in the self-storage industry since 1977 and
led two of the earliest self-storage facility development projects in the United States.


The
remainder of our executive management team and their years of experience are as follows: Kent Christensen, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, 8 years; Charles
Allen, Senior Vice President, Senior Legal Counsel, 8 years; and Karl Haas, Senior Vice President Operations, 18 years.

Members
of the executive management team have guided the Company through substantial growth, developing and acquiring over $2.75 billion in assets since 1996. This growth has been
funded through equity offerings and more than $2.0 billion in private equity capital since 1998. This private equity
capital has come primarily from sophisticated, high net-worth individuals and institutional investors such as affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. and Fidelity Investments.

Our
executive management and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the Company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 5.3 million shares
or 10.3% of our outstanding common stock as of February 28, 2006.

Industry & Competition

Self-storage properties refer to properties that offer do-it-yourself, month-to-month storage space
rental for personal or business use. Self-storage offers a cost-effective and flexible storage alternative. Tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according
to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited, exclusive access. Tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units. Self-storage unit sizes
typically range from five feet by five feet to 20 feet by 20 feet, with an interior height of eight to 12 feet. Properties generally have on-site managers who supervise and run the
day-to-day operations, providing tenants with assistance as needed.

Self-storage
provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions, whether due to a life-change, or simply because of a need for
storage space. The mix of residential tenants using a self-storage property is determined by a property's local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their
living space or others who are not yet settled in large homes.

Items
that residential tenants place in self-storage properties range from cars, boats and recreational vehicles, to furniture, household items and appliances. Commercial
tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods, records or extra inventory or storage for seasonal goods.

Our
research has shown that tenants choose a self-storage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business, making high-density,
high-traffic population centers ideal locations for locating a self-storage property. A property's perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and
staff are also contributing factors to a site's ability to successfully secure rentals. Although most self-storage properties are leased to tenants on a
month-to-month basis, tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time.

Self-storage
does have seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for self-storage properties. Based on our experience, generally, there is increased leasing
activity at self-storage properties during the summer months due to the higher number of people who relocate during this period. The highest level of occupancy is achieved in July and
August, while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in February and March.

Since
inception in the early 1970's the self-storage industry has experienced significant growth. In the past ten years, there has been even greater growth. According to the
2006 Self-Storage Almanac (the "Almanac"), in 1995 there were only 23,972 self-storage properties in the United States, with an average occupancy rate of 88.5% of net rentable
square feet compared to 41,122 self-storage properties in 2005 with an average occupancy rate of 83.0% of net rentable square feet. As population densities have increased in the United
States, there has been an increase in self-storage awareness and corresponding development, which we expect will continue in the future.


Our
research indicates that the factors most important to tenants when choosing a self-storage site are a convenient location, a clean environment, friendly service and a
professional helpful staff. Our experience also indicates that successfully competing in the self-storage industry requires an experienced and dedicated management team that is supported
by an efficient and flexible operating platform that is responsive to tenants' needs and expectations.

Increased
competition has affected our business and has led to both pricing and discount pressure. This has limited our ability to increase revenues in many markets in which we operate.
Many markets have been able to absorb the increase in self-storage development due to superior demographics and density. However, select markets have not been able to absorb the new
facilities and have not performed as well.

We
have encountered competition when we seek to acquire properties, especially for brokered portfolios. Aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private
entities, and this competition has limited our ability to grow at a more consistent pace.

Increased
development within the self-storage industry has also led to an increased emphasis on site location, property design, innovation and functionality. We strive to
have a creative and flexible approach to our development projects and we are open to a broad array of opportunities because of this flexibility. This is especially true for new sites slated for
high-density population centers, to accommodate the requirements and tastes of local planning and zoning boards, and to distinguish a facility from other offerings in the market. Due to
the attractive architecture of many of our development properties, we have been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most
self-storage developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial users.

The
industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership. According to the Almanac, the top five self-storage companies in the United States owned approximately 10.0% of
total U.S. self-storage properties, and the top 50 self-storage companies owned approximately 15.3% of the total U.S. properties. We believe this fragmentation will contribute
to continued consolidation at some level into the future. We also believe we are well positioned to be able to compete for acquisitions given our enhanced ability to access capital as a public company
and our historical reputation for closing deals.

After
our acquisition of the Storage USA properties on July 14, 2005, we became the second largest self-storage owner and operator in the United States. We are now one
of five public self-storage REITS along with Public Storage Inc. (NYSE: PSA), Shurgard Storage Centers, Inc. (NYSE: SHU), Sovran Self-Storage, Inc. (NYSE:
SSS), and U-Store-It Inc. (NYSE: YSI).

Growth and Investment Strategies

Our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable long-term growth
in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term stockholder value. Our business strategy to achieve these objectives consists of the following elements:

•

Maximize Cash Flow at Our Properties.

We
seek to maximize revenue-generating opportunities by responding to changing local market conditions through interactive yield management of the rental rates and discount levels at our properties.
Supported by STORE (our licensed property management software), we will seek to respond to changing market conditions and to maximize revenue-generating opportunities through interactive rental rate
management.

•

Pursue Opportunities to Acquire Self-Storage Portfolios.

We
intend to continue to selectively acquire, for cash or by utilizing units in our Operating Partnership as acquisition currency, privately-held self-storage portfolios and
single self-storage


assets
in high population density areas with an undersupply or equilibrium of self-storage demand, re-flag them under the Extra Space Storage brand name, and implement our
comprehensive property and operating systems so as to maximize operating performance over time.

•

Strategically Select and Develop Sites.

We
plan to continue to expand by selecting and developing new self-storage properties with cost-effective, appealing construction in desirable areas based on specific data,
including: visibility and convenience of location, market occupancy and rental rates, market saturation, traffic count, household density, median household income, barriers to entry and future
demographic and migration trends. Because of the attractive architecture of many of our properties, we have been able to eliminate a typical barrier of entry for most self-storage
developers in areas usually reserved for more traditional retail and commercial properties.

•

Continue Joint Venture Strategy to Pursue Development Opportunities and Enhance Returns.

We
plan to grow by continuing our development activities in conjunction with our joint venture partners while mitigating the risks normally associated with early-stage development and
lease-up activities. Where appropriate, we plan to also seek to acquire properties in a capital-efficient manner in conjunction with our joint venture partners. Typically in these deals,
we seek to have a small capital interest, and once our joint venture partner receives a predetermined return on its investment, the remaining profits will be distributed between us and our joint
venture partners.

Financing of Our Growth Strategies

•

Acquisition Financing

We,
as guarantor, and our Operating Partnership currently have a $100 million revolving line of credit that is collateralized by our self-storage properties. As of
December 31, 2005, the credit facility had approximately $76.1 million of available borrowings based on the assets collateralizing the credit facility. We expect to maintain a flexible
approach in financing new property acquisitions. We plan to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under the credit facility, traditional secured mortgage financing and
additional equity offerings.

•

Development Joint Venture Financing

We
own 341 of our stabilized properties and 13 of our lease-up properties through joint ventures with third parties, including affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. In each joint
venture, we generally manage the day-to-day operations of the underlying properties and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of properties or
financings by the applicable joint venture. Our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business. Under the operating
agreements for the joint ventures, we typically maintain the right to receive between 17.0% and 50.0% of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners have received a
predetermined return, and between 17.0% and 50.0% of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners have received a return of its capital plus such predetermined
return. Some joint venture agreements include buy-sell rights, as well as rights of first refusal in connection with the sale of properties by the joint venture.

•

Disposition of Properties

We
will continue to review our portfolio for properties or groups of properties that are not strategically located and determine whether to dispose of these properties to fund other growth.


Regulation

Generally, self-storage properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to lien sale rights and
procedures. Changes in any of these laws or regulations, as well as changes in laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act, or CERCLA, which increase the
potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on properties, or laws affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and
taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of self-storage sites or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

Under
the American Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These
requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the properties, or restrict further renovations thereof,
with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to
correct any non-complying feature, thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures. To the extent our properties are not in compliance, we are likely to incur additional costs to comply
with the ADA.

Insurance
activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson
Act, and are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.

Property
management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.

Changes
in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of February 28, 2006, we had 1,943 employees and believe our relationship with our employees to be good. Our employees are not represented by a
collective bargaining agreement.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

An investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other
information contained in this Annual Report before trading in our securities. If any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects and
financial condition could be harmed.

Our
performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments. We are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties. There are a number of
factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate, including the following:

Risks Related to Our Properties and Operations

If we are unable to promptly re-let our units or if the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than expected, then our business and results
of operations would be adversely affected.

Virtually all of our leases are on a month-to-month basis. Any delay in re-letting units as vacancies arise would reduce our
revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, lower than expected rental rates upon re-letting could impede our growth.


We face increasing competition for the acquisition of self-storage properties and other assets, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may
increase the cost of these acquisitions.

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of self-storage properties and other assets,
including national, regional and local operators and developers of self-storage properties. These competitors may drive up the price we must pay for self-storage properties or
other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors
because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for
suitable investment properties may increase. This competition will result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them. Because of an increased interest in
single-property acquisitions among tax-motivated individual purchasers, we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions. If we pay
higher prices for self-storage properties or other assets, our profitability will be reduced.

Our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns, which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for
distributions.

A key component of our growth strategy is exploring new asset development and redevelopment opportunities through strategic joint ventures. To the extent that we
engage in these development and redevelopment activities, they will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects:

•

we
may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all;

•

we
may not complete development projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;

•

we
may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations; and

•

occupancy
rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may
result in our investment not being profitable.

In
deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. We may underestimate the costs
necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly acquired property as quickly as expected or at all.
Any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results, liquidity and financial
condition, which could result in a decline in the value of our securities.

We
may in the future develop self-storage properties in geographic regions where we do not currently have a significant presence and where we do not possess the same level of
familiarity with development, which could adversely affect our ability to develop such properties successfully or at all or to achieve expected performance.

We
rely to a large extent on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding our development and redevelopment projects. If our reputation in the self-storage
industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced, our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected, which would limit our
growth.

We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth and negatively affect our stock price.

Our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment
opportunities that meet our criteria and are


compatible
with our growth strategy. We may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on
satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price.

Our
ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks:

•

competition
from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital, including other publicly-traded REITs and institutional investment funds;

•

competition
from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability;

•

satisfactory
completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions;

•

failure
to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all;

•

we
may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties; and

•

we
may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for
clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors,
officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.

In
addition, strategic decisions by us, such as acquisitions, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.

We may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties.

We expect to make future acquisitions of self-storage properties. If we acquire any self-storage properties, we will be required to
integrate them into our existing portfolio. The acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated, may cause disruptions in our operations or
may divert management's attention away from
day-to-day operations, which could impair our results of operations as a whole.

We depend upon our on-site personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties, and any difficulties we encounter in hiring, training and
maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance.

We have 1,628 field personnel as of February 28, 2006 in the management and operation of our properties. The general professionalism of our site managers
and staff are contributing factors to a site's ability to successfully secure rentals. We also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure self-storage properties. If we are
unable to successfully recruit, train and retain qualified field personnel, the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased
occupancy levels and reduced operating performance.

Other self-storage operators may employ STORE or a technology similar to STORE, which could enhance their ability to compete with us.

We rely on STORE to support all aspects of our business operations and to help us implement new development and acquisition opportunities and strategies. If other
self-storage companies obtain a license to use STORE, or employ or develop a technology similar to STORE, their ability to compete with us could be enhanced.


Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow.

We maintain comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders), extended coverage and rental loss
insurance with respect to our properties with policy specifications, limits and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties. Certain types of losses, however, may be either uninsurable or
not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war or terrorism. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and
anticipated profits and cash flow from a property. In addition, if any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay a significant deductible on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our
insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.

Increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income.

Costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us. Increases in income, property or
other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income, FFO, cash flow, financial condition, ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations, ability to
make distributions to stockholders, and the trading price of our common stock. Similarly, changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or
increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We did not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties, and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by
third-party appraisals.

We do not always obtained third-party appraisals of the properties in connection with our acquisitions of properties and the consideration being paid by us in
exchange for those properties may exceed the value as determined by third-party appraisals. In such cases, the terms of any agreements and the valuation methods used to determine the value of the
properties were determined by our senior management team.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations.

Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and
remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property. Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was
responsible for, the presence of such substances or materials. The presence of such substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's or
operator's ability to lease, sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated
materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. Certain
environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury
associated with asbestos-containing materials.

Certain
environmental laws also impose liability, without regard to knowledge or fault, for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and
operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property. Moreover, the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal
injuries or


property
damages that may result from such releases, as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases.

Certain
environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances.
For example, environmental laws govern the management of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions.

No
assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of our
properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties. There also
exists the risk that material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future. Finally, future laws, ordinances
or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability.

Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results.

Our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our self-storage properties. Adverse economic or
other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts. If our properties fail to generate
revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements, including operating and other expenses, debt service and capital expenditures, our net income, funds from operations ("FFO"), cash flow, financial
condition, ability to make distributions to stockholders and common stock trading price could be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the operating performance
of our properties:

•

the
national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate, which may be adversely impacted by, among other factors,
industry slowdowns, relocation of businesses and changing demographics;

•

periods
of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand for self-storage or the public perception that any of these events may occur
could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults;

•

local
or regional real estate market conditions such as the oversupply of self-storage or a reduction in demand for self-storage in a particular
area;

•

perceptions
by prospective users of our self-storage properties of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which
they are located;

•

increased
operating costs, including need for capital improvements, insurance premiums, real estate

•

taxes
and utilities;

•

changes
in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area;

•

the
impact of environmental protection laws;

•

earthquakes,
hurricanes and other natural disasters, terrorist acts, civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses; and

•

changes
in tax, real estate and zoning laws.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure

Our business could be harmed if key personnel with long-standing business relationships in the self-storage industry terminate their employment with us.

Our success depends, to a significant extent, on the continued services of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the other members of our executive
management team. Our executive


management
team has substantial experience in the self-storage industry. In addition, our ability to continue to develop properties depends on the significant relationships our executive
management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. There is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us.
We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers. The loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team, particularly our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, could harm our business and our prospects.

We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different risks.

We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different risks.
We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments and
engaging in business activities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this document. A change in our investment strategy or our entry into new
lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations.

If other self-storage companies convert to an UPREIT structure or if tax laws change, we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions.

Because we are structured as an UPREIT, we are a more attractive acquirer of property to tax-motivated sellers than our competitors that are not
structured as UPREITs. However, if other self-storage companies restructure their holdings to become UPREITs, this competitive advantage will disappear. In addition, new legislation may be
enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), or the U.S. Treasury Department that could affect the attractiveness of our UPREIT
structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions.

Tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels.

In connection with the formation transactions, we agreed to make available to each of Kenneth M. Woolley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard
S. Tanner, our Senior Vice President, Development, and other third parties, the following tax protections: for nine years, with a three-year extension if the applicable party continues to
own at least 50% of the OP units received by it in the formation transactions at the expiration of the initial nine-year period, the opportunity to (1) guarantee debt or
(2) enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation, in an aggregate amount, with respect to the foregoing contributors, of at least equal to $60.0 million. We
agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions. These obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness than we
would not otherwise require for our business.

Our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority.

As of December 31, 2005, we held interests in 354 properties through joint ventures. All of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of
sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers' financial conditions and disputes between us and our co-venturers. We expect to continue our joint venture
strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new self-storage properties and acquiring existing properties. In such event, we would not be in a position to
exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. The decision-making authority regarding the properties we currently hold through joint
ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners, is subject to a majority vote of the joint


venture
partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners. In addition, investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not
present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions.
Partners or co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions
contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would
have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and
prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting
properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers,
which could harm our financial condition.

Kenneth M. Woolley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Spencer F. Kirk, one of our directors, Richard S. Tanner, Senior Vice President, Development,
Kent W. Christensen, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Charles L. Allen, Senior Vice President, Senior Legal Counsel, members of our senior management team, have
outside business interests which could divert their time and attention away from us, which could harm our business.

Kenneth M. Woolley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as one of our directors and certain other members of our senior management team, have
outside business interests. These business interests include the ownership of a self-storage property located in Pico Rivera, California, which as of December 31, 2005 was in
lease-up, and the ownership of Extra Space Development LLC. Other than this property and Extra Space Development, LLC, the members of our senior management are not currently engaged in any
other self-storage activities outside the company. In addition, Mr. Woolley's employment agreement includes an exception to his
non-competition covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote a portion of his time to the management and operations of RMI Development, LLC, a multi-family business in which he has
a majority ownership. Although Mr. Woolley's employment agreement requires that he devote substantially his full business time and attention to us, this agreement also permits him to devote
time to his outside business interests. These outside business interests could interfere with his ability to devote time to our business and affairs and as a result, our business could be harmed.

Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership.

Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our operating partnership or
any partner thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our company. At the same time, we, through
our wholly owned subsidiary, have fiduciary duties, as a general partner, to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of our operating
partnership. Our duties, through our wholly owned subsidiary, as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to
our company. The partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership.

Unless
otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty
standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness, and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any
transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest.


Additionally,
the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we, our direct wholly owned Massachusetts business trust subsidiary, as the general
partner of the operating partnership, nor any of our or their trustees, directors or officers, will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership, the limited partners or assignees
for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we, or such trustee, director or officer, acted in good faith. In addition, our operating partnership is required to
indemnify us, our affiliates and each of our respective trustees, officers, directors, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising
from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the operating partnership, provided that our
operating partnership will not indemnify for (1) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (2) any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in
violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful.

The
provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we
have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law
were it not for the partnership agreement.

Our management's ownership of contingent conversion shares, or CCSs, and contingent conversion units, or CCUs, may cause them to devote a disproportionate amount of time to the
performance of the 14 wholly owned early-stage lease-up properties, which could cause our overall operating performance to suffer.

In connection with our IPO, we issued to certain contributors, which included certain members of our senior management, CCSs and/or a combination of OP units and
CCUs. The terms of the CCSs and CCUs provide that they will convert into our common stock and OP units, respectively, only if the relevant 14 lease-up properties identified at the
time of the initial public offering achieve specified performance thresholds prior to December 31, 2008. As a result, our directors and officers who own CCSs and CCUs may have an incentive to
devote a disproportionately large amount of their time and attention to these properties in comparison with our remaining properties, which could harm our operating results.

We may pursue less vigorous enforcement of terms of contribution and other agreements because of conflicts of interest with certain of our officers.

Kenneth M. Woolley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Spencer F. Kirk, who serves as director, Kent W. Christensen, Senior Vice President,
Chief Financial Officer, Charles L. Allen, Senior Vice President, Senior Legal Counsel, and Richard S. Tanner, Senior Vice President, Development had direct or indirect ownership interests in certain
properties that were contributed to our operating partnership in the formation transactions. Following the completion of the formation transactions, we, under the agreements relating to the
contribution of such interests, became entitled to indemnification and damages in the event of breaches of representations or warranties made by the contributors. In addition, Kenneth M.
Woolley's employment agreement includes an exception to his non-competition covenant pursuant to which he is permitted to devote time to the management and operations of RMI Development,
LLC, a multi-family business. None of these contribution and non-competition agreements was negotiated on an arm's-length basis. We may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less
vigorously, our rights under these contribution and non-competition agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationships with the individuals party to these agreements.


Certain provisions of Maryland law and our organizational documents, including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter, may inhibit market activity in our stock and
could prevent or delay a change in control transaction.

Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT
and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common stock or 7.0% (by value or
by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding capital stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit.
However, our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. These restrictions on
ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The ownership limit may delay or
impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Different ownership limits apply to the
family of Kenneth M. Woolley, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and Spencer F. Kirk, certain of his affiliates,
family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and certain designated investment entities (as defined in our charter).

Our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders.

Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate
number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval. In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common
stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish
a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or
otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.

Maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she
reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter eliminates our
directors' and officers' liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property or services or active and
deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. Our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions
taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might
otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers.

To the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent
sale of common stock.

Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a U.S. stockholder under
current U.S. federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his, her, or its common stock, but instead will constitute a return of
capital and will reduce such adjusted basis. If distributions


result
in a reduction of a stockholder's adjusted basis in such holder's common stock, subsequent sales of such holder's common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or
realized capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis.

Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our primary business involves the ownership, operation and development of self-storage properties.

Our current strategy is to own, operate and develop only self-storage properties. Consequently, we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a
single industry. Because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid, this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic
conditions change. Decreases in market rents, negative tax, real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs, lower the value of our
investments and decrease our income, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

Any negative perceptions of the self-storage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price.

To the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the self-storage industry, the value of our common stock may be negatively
impacted, which could result in our common stock trading below the inherent value of our assets.

Costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses.

Under the ADA, all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These
requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties, or restrict certain further renovations of the
properties, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in
an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine
our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ADA or other legislation, then we
would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or other legislation, our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.

Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties.

Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic,
financial and investment conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors,
including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms
offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.

We
may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those
defects or


to
make those improvements. In acquiring a property, we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions,
such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. These transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or
appropriate.

Any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield income-producing returns, if at all, and may result in additional costs to us to comply with
re-zoning restrictions or environmental regulations.

We have invested in the past, and may invest in the future, in unimproved real property. Unimproved properties generally take longer to yield income-producing
returns based on the typical time required for development. Any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with re-zoning the land for
a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups. Any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an income-producing return or increased
costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our
financial condition and operating results.

Risks Related to Our Debt Financings

Required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or
necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $866.8 million of outstanding indebtedness. We expect to incur additional debt in connection with
future acquisitions. We may borrow under our line of credit or borrow new funds to acquire these future properties. Additionally, we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be
adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and, therefore, we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity and/or debt offerings.
Further, we may need to borrow funds to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT or to meet our expected distributions.

If
we are required to utilize our line of credit for purposes other than acquisition activity, this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth.
Therefore, our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:

•

our
cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;

•

we
may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, including to make acquisitions or distributions required to maintain our qualification as a
REIT;

•

we
may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;

•

because
a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense;

•

we
may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms;

•

after
debt service, the amount available for distributions to our stockholders is reduced;

•

our
debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt;

•

we
may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns, reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;

•

we
may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases;


•

we
may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and

•

our
default under any one of our mortgage loans with cross-default or cross-collateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the
foreclosures of other properties.

We could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur.

Our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur. We could alter the balance
between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time. If we become more highly leveraged, then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our
ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated distributions and/or the distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification, and could harm our financial
condition.

Increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make distributions to our
stockholders.

As of December 31, 2005 we had approximately $866.8 million of debt outstanding, of which approximately $94.2 million, or 10.9% will be
subject to variable interest rates (including $61.8 million on which we had a reverse interest rate swap). This variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.7% per
annum. Increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay distributions. For example, if market rates of
interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.0 million annually.

Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.

In certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements. Hedging involves risks, such as the
risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Risks Related to Qualification and Operation as a REIT

To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions.

To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains, and we are
subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the
amount, if any, by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from
prior years. In order to maintain our REIT qualification and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis, or possibly
long-term, to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from a
difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of
reserves or required debt amortization payments.


Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.

The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual U.S. stockholders is 15% (through 2008). Dividends paid by
REITs, however, are generally not eligible
for the reduced rates. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive
than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock.

In
addition, the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends, which could negatively affect
the value of our properties.

Possible legislative or other actions affecting REITs could adversely affect our stockholders.

The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S.
Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what forms, or with what
effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed.

The power of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.

Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines
that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no
longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders.

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.

We operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT
or lose our qualification as a REIT at any time, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to you for each of the years involved
because:

•

we
would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate
rates;

•

we
also could be subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless
we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following a year during which we were
disqualified.

In
addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular
corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that our U.S. individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates, and our
U.S. corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject, in each case, to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. As a
result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our common stock.


Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative
interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code is greater in the case of a REIT that, like
us, holds its assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to
qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and sources of our gross income. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests
depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to precise determination, and for which we will not obtain any independent appraisals. Also, we must
make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or
court decisions may adversely affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments.

We will pay some taxes.

Even though we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and
property. Extra Space Management, Inc. manages self-storage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. We, jointly with Extra Space
Management, Inc., elected to treat Extra Space Management, Inc. as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" of our Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary is a fully
taxable corporation, and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us. In addition, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements
among our tenants, our taxable REIT subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers
in the ordinary course of business. To the extent that we are or our taxable REIT subsidiary is required to pay U.S. federal, state or local taxes, we will have less cash available for distribution to
stockholders.

Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.

To qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature
and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests,
we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.    Properties

As of December 31, 2005, we owned or had ownership interests in 546 self-storage properties located in 34 states, including Washington D.C. Of
these properties, 192 are wholly-owned and 354 are held in joint ventures. In addition, we managed an additional 85 properties for franchisees or third parties. The properties owned and operated
before the Storage USA acquisition operate under the trade-marked Extra Space Storage brand name. We are currently implementing a re-branding program that will convert all of the Storage
USA properties to the Extra Space Storage brand. As of December 31, 2005 we owned or had ownership interest in approximately 38 million square feet of space configured in approximately
370,000 separate storage units. Approximately 70% of our properties are clustered around the larger population centers, such as Baltimore/Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los
Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St.


Petersburg/Tampa
and San Francisco. These markets contain above-average population and income demographics and high barriers to entry for new self-storage properties. The clustering of assets around
these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. The Storage USA acquisition has given us the increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in
many markets where we had no previous presence.

We
consider a property to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. We also consider a property
to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80% occupancy rate or has been open for three years. These same rules have been applied to the recently acquired SUSA properties.

As
of December 31, 2005, greater than 100,000 tenants were leasing storage units at our 192 wholly-owned properties, primarily on a month-to-month basis,
providing the
flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Although leases are short-term in duration, the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended
period of time. For properties that were stabilized as of December 31, 2005, the median length of stay was approximately 11 months.


The
following table sets forth additional information regarding the occupancy of the stabilized properties on a state-by-state basis as of December 31,
2005 and 2004. The information as of December 31, 2004 is on a pro forma basis as though all the properties owned at December 31, 2005 were under our control as of December 31,
2004.

Our property portfolio is a made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality
where it is located. Most often sites are what we consider "hybrid" facilities, or a mix of both drive-up buildings and multi-floor buildings. We have a number of multi-floor buildings with elevator
access only, and a number of facilities featuring ground-floor access only.

Our
properties are generally situated in convenient, highly visible locations clustered around large population bases; however, due to certain factors, we have a handful of locations
outside the top
Metropolitan Statistical Areas ("MSA's") that were developed or acquired based on the market, familiarity with the properties, or as part of a larger portfolio.

In
addition to our 192 wholly-owned properties and the 354 properties in which we have an ownership interest, we also manage 85 properties for third parties and franchisees as of
December 31, 2005 bringing total properties which we own and/or manage to 631. We receive a management fee equal to approximately 6.0% of gross revenues to manage these joint ventures, third
parties and franchisees sites.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are involved in various litigation and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We are not a party to any material litigation or legal proceedings, or
to the best of our knowledge, any threatened litigation or legal proceedings which, in the opinion of management individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

There were no matters submitted to a vote of our security holders during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005.

of shares of common stock are entitled to receive distributions when declared by our board of directors out of any assets legally available for that purpose. As a REIT, we are
required to distribute at least 90% of our "REIT taxable income" is generally equivalent to our net taxable ordinary income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, to our
stockholders annually in order to maintain our REIT qualifications for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

On June 20, 2005, we completed the sale of 6,200,000 shares of our common stock, $.01 par value, for $83,514, which we reported in a Current Report on
Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 24, 2005. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. The shares were
issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Item 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in
this Form 10-K entitled "Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information." Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from
those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see the section in this Form 10-K entitled "Statements Regarding Forward-Looking
Information."

Overview

We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, formed to continue the business
commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own, operate, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties. Since 1996, our fully integrated development
and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of more than 600 self-storage properties.

In
July 2005, we, along with joint-venture partner Prudential Real Estate Investors ("PREI"), acquired Storage USA ("SUSA") from GE Commercial Finance for approximately
$2.3 billion in cash. The transaction, the largest to date in the self-storage industry, made us the second largest operator of self-storage facilities in the United
States with 631 properties owned or managed in 34 states including Washington, D.C. As of December 31, 2005, 192 of our properties were wholly owned, we held joint venture interests in 354
properties, and our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc., operated an additional 85 properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee.
The properties that we own or in which we hold an ownership interest contain approximately 38 million square feet of rentable space contained in approximately 370,000 units and currently serve
a customer base of 275,000 tenants.

The
SUSA acquisition gives us a national platform upon which to leverage operational, advertising and other economic efficiencies. The acquisition also creates a built-in
acquisition pipeline through various joint-venture, franchise and third-party management partners from which we can grow
in the future. We have also been able to retain several key executives from the SUSA organization, as well as the majority of its field operations team.

To
maximize the performance of our properties, we employ a state-of-the-art, proprietary, web-based tracking and yield management
technology called STORE. Developed by our management team, STORE enables us to analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions.
As part of the SUSA acquisition, we gained access to SUSA's industry leading revenue management team ("RevMan"), which managed SUSA's rental rate and discount strategies. We believe that the
combination of STORE's yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by RevMan will allow us to more proactively manage revenue in the future.

We
derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our self-storage properties and from management fees on the
properties we manage for joint-venture partners, franchisees and unaffiliated third parties. This management fee is equal to approximately 6% of total revenues generated by the managed properties.

We
operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple self-storage properties from which to choose. Competition has impacted, and will continue to impact our
property results. We experience minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. Our operating results,
therefore, depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage space, to actively manage unit rental rates, and


on
the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by
adjusting rental rates through the use of STORE, the operating management software employed at the properties and through the use of the process developed by RevMan.

We
continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value. Our strategies to maximize stockholder value
include:

•

Maximize Cash Flow at Our Properties—

We seek to maximize revenue-generating opportunities by responding to
changing local market conditions through interactive yield management of the rental rates at our properties.

•

Pursue Opportunities to Acquire Self-Storage Portfolios—

We intend to continue to selectively acquire,
for cash or by utilizing OP units as acquisition currency, privately-held self-storage portfolios and single self-storage assets in high population density areas.

•

Strategically Select and Develop Sites—

We plan to continue to expand by selecting and developing new
self-storage properties through joint ventures.

•

Continue Our Joint Venture Strategy to Pursue Development Opportunities and Enhance Returns—

We plan to grow by
continuing our development activities in conjunction with our joint venture partners thus mitigating the risks normally associated with early-stage development and lease-up activities.
Where appropriate, we plan to also seek to acquire properties in a capital-efficient manner in conjunction with our joint venture partners.

During
2005 we acquired 70 wholly-owned properties and minority equity interests in 336 additional properties. We completed the development of six properties in our core markets
including two expansions of wholly-owned properties. One of these development properties is owned by us in a joint venture, and the other three properties are owned by Extra Space Development, an
entity in which we do not have any ownership interest, but which is owned by certain members of senior management. These joint venture and third party development properties provide us with a
potential acquisition pipeline in the future. Thirteen properties are scheduled for completion in 2006, eight of which will be owned by us in a joint-venture format.

As
of December 31, 2005, we operated 631 properties located in 34 states including Washington, D.C. Of the 631 properties, 192 are wholly owned, 354 are held in joint ventures
with third parties, and an additional 85 properties are owned by franchisees or third parties and managed by us in exchange for a management fee. The properties are generally situated in convenient,
highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as Baltimore/Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia,
Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco. These areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels and high barriers to entry for new self-storage properties. The
clustering of our assets around these population centers, which has intensified following the SUSA acquisition, enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. We consider a
property to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. A property is considered to be stabilized once it has
achieved an 80% occupancy rate or has been open for three years.

In
the Results of Operations discussion below, we will compare the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 with historical results of operations for the
Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2004 through August 16, 2004 and with our historical results of operations for the period from August 17, 2004 through
December 31, 2004. Comparisons to any prior periods are to the historical results of the operations of the Predecessor.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and assumptions on
historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most
critical accounting policies.

CONSOLIDATION:

We follow FASB Interpretation No. 46R, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46R"), which addresses the
consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs"). Under FIN 46R, arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as VIEs. An enterprise is required
to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

Under
FIN 46R, a VIE is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support
from other parties, or (ii) the entity's equity holders as a group either: (a) lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or similar rights,
(b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an entity
is deemed to be a VIE pursuant to FIN 46R, the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of the VIE is considered
the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.

Based
on the provisions of FIN 46R, we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we (i) enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and
pay a non-refundable deposit, or (ii) enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (ii) (b) or (c) of the
previous paragraph. For each VIE created, we have considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in FIN 46R. If we are determined to
be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with our financial statements.

REAL ESTATE ASSETS:

Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated with the
development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction
period are capitalized.

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their
estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are generally between 5 and
39 years.

In
connection with our acquisition of properties, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values. The value of the
tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, are determined as if vacant, that is, at replacement cost. Intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are
recorded at their estimated fair values. We measure the value of tenant relationships based on our historical experience with turnover in its facilities. We amortize to expense the tenant
relationships on a


straight-line
basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility (currently estimated to be18 months).

Intangible
lease rights represent purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases. These rights are amortized to expense over the
life of the lease.

EVALUATION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT:

We evaluate long-lived assets which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances indicate
that there may be an impairment. If such events occur, we compare the carrying value of these long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the
assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset. The impairment loss recognized equals
the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset.

When
real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value, net of selling costs. If the estimated fair value, net of
selling costs, of the assets that have been identified for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, then a valuation allowance is established. The operations of assets held for sale or
sold during the period are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE VENTURES:

Our investments in real estate joint ventures, where we have significant influence, but not control and joint
ventures which are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Under
the equity method, our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real estate
ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows, we
follow the "look through" approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances
of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture's sale of assets) in which case it is
reported as an investing activity.

Our
management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired when events or circumstances indicate that there may
be an impairment. An investment is impaired if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred, and it is considered to
be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The accounting for changes in the
fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or
firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted
transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.


For
derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as
cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss), outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to
earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.

CONVERSION OF OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS:

Conversions of Operating Partnership units to common stock, when converted under the original provisions of
the agreement, is accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 95-7, "Implementation Issues Related to the Treatment of Minority Interest in Certain Real Estate Investment Trusts."

REVENUE AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION:

Rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally
on month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Property expenses, including utilities, property taxes,
repairs and maintenance and other cost to manage the facilities are recorded as incurred.

Management
and franchise fee revenue and tenant insurance revenue are recognized when earned. Development and acquisition fee revenue is recognized ratably as development costs are incurred.

REAL ESTATE SALES:

We evaluate real estate sales for both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate". In general, sales of real estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of
ownership have been transferred. Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition; other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but
require deferral of profit recognition.

INCOME TAXES:

We have elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). In
order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, among other things, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature
of our income and assets. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income, which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders.
We plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical
and complex. If we were to fail to meet these requirements, we would be subject to federal income tax. We are subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in
real estate and other taxes in our consolidated statement of operations.

We
have elected to treat certain of our existing and newly created corporate subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS"). In general, our TRS may perform additional services for tenants and
generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any
person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:

As permitted by SFAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123," we have elected to


measure
and record compensation cost relative to employee stock option costs in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
and related interpretations and make pro forma disclosures of net loss and basic loss per share as if the fair value method of valuing stock options had been applied. Under ABP No. 25,
compensation cost is recognized for stock options granted to employees when the option price is less than the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2005 to the Year Ended December 31, 2004

Overview

Results for the year ended December 31, 2005 included the operations of 546 properties (192 of which were consolidated and 354 of which were in joint
ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2004, which included operations of 147 properties, seven of which were deconsolidated
during 2004, (128 of which were consolidated and 19 of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method). Results for the year ended December 31, 2004 include the results of
six properties in which we did not own any interest and one where we sold our joint venture interest in 2004. These six properties were consolidated as a result of guarantees and/or puts for which we
were liable. Five of the six properties were deconsolidated on August 16, 2004 upon the release of all guarantees and puts, and the other property was deconsolidated on December 31,
2004. Results for both periods also included equity in earnings of real estate ventures, third-party management and franchise fees, acquisition fees and development fees.

Property Rental—

The increase in property rental revenues consists of $24,703 associated with the acquisition of 61
wholly-owned properties in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition in July 2005, $23,827 associated with other acquisitions, $6,953 from the buyout of certain joint venture interests previously
accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and $2,880 from increases in occupancy at lease-up properties. These increases were offset by a decrease of $379 due primarily to the
deconsolidation of certain properties in 2004.

Management and Franchise Fees—

Our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc., manages properties owned by
our joint ventures and third parties. Management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash collected from properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in management
fees is due mainly to new fees associated with the SUSA acquisition. Through this acquisition we obtained equity interests in joint ventures which own a total of 336 properties. We obtained management
contracts for these new joint venture properties, and also


obtained
over 50 new third party and franchise management contracts in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition.

Tenant Insurance—

Tenant insurance revenue relates to a new tenant insurance program adopted in 2005. This program was started
in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition to replace SUSA's tenant insurance program.

Acquisition and Development Fees—

The decrease in acquisition and development fee revenue was due to the decreased volume of
development relating to joint ventures in 2005 compared to prior years.

Other Income—

Other income represents primarily income from truck rentals. The increase in other income is associated with to
the SUSA acquisition and other acquisitions made in 2005.

Property Operations—

The increase in property operations expense in 2005 was primarily due to increases of $9,045 associated
with the SUSA acquisition, $8,852 associated with other acquisitions, and $1,873 from the buyout of certain joint venture interests (previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting).
There were also increases in expenses of $733 at existing properties due to increases in utilities, repairs and maintenance and property taxes, which was partially offset by the decrease of $606 of
property operating expenses due to the deconsolidation of certain properties in 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we and the Predecessor opened five new properties and acquired 44
new properties. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we acquired 61 properties in connection with the SUSA acquisition, and 9 properties in other acquisitions.

Tenant Insurance—

Tenant insurance expense for 2005 relates to a new tenant insurance program adopted in 2005. This program was
started in conjunction with the SUSA acquisition to replace SUSA's tenant insurance program.

Unrecovered Development/Acquisition Costs and Support Payments—

Unrecovered development costs for 2005 decreased when compared
to 2004 due to lower level of development activity.

General and Administrative—

The significant increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended
December 31, 2005 was due mainly to the increased costs associated with the management of the additional properties that have been added through acquisitions and new joint venture arrangements
entered into during 2005. We incurred approximately $1,500 of additional general and administrative expenses during 2005 relating to the integration of the SUSA properties and


administrative
systems and $601 of amortization of deferred compensation expense related to stock grants.

Depreciation and Amortization—

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense results from more properties being open
during the year ended December 31, 2005 than were open during the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to acquisitions of new properties. We acquired 70 properties during 2005, 61 of
which were acquired in connection with the SUSA acquisition.

Interest Expense and Loss on Debt Extinguishments—

The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005
was due primarily to $4,312 of interest incurred on the new trust preferred debt and $7,977 of interest expense on the mortgage loans on the 61 properties acquired in connection with the SUSA
acquisition. The remainder of the increase was due mainly to other new loans obtained in 2005 related to the SUSA acquisition and other acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2004,
there was $3,523 paid to extinguish debt. There was no debt extinguishment expense in 2005. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $459 and $1,213,
respectively. During 2005, we acquired 70 new properties, which increased outstanding debt by $206,198 as of December 31, 2005.

Interest Income—

The significant increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the
prior year was mainly the result of the interest earned on the $37,667 of notes receivable that we acquired in connection with the SUSA acquisition. These notes receivable were paid down to $12,109 by
December 31, 2005.

Minority interest—Fidelity Preferred Return—

Minority interest—Fidelity preferred return was $0 for the
year ended December 31, 2005 as the Fidelity minority interest was redeemed September 9, 2004.

Minority Interest—Operating Partnership—

Loss allocated to the Operating Partnership represents 8.04% of the net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2005. The amount allocated to minority interest was higher than in the prior year due mainly to the fact that the Operating Partnership was in place for a
full year in 2005, compared to only the period subsequent to the IPO in 2004.

Loss Allocated to Other Minority Interests—

There were no losses allocated to other minority interests during the year ended
December 31, 2005 because we redeemed or deconsolidated all other


minority
interests in operating properties during the year ended December 31, 2004. The only other minority interest in place as of December 31, 2005 is an interest in a development
property which has not yet begun operations.

Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Ventures—

The increase in equity in earnings of real estate ventures is due primarily to our
purchase of new equity interests in joint ventures. As a result of the SUSA acquisition we own joint venture interests an additional 336 new properties.

Gain on Sale of Real Estate Assets—

The gain on sale of real estate assets was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2005
as there were no significant gains on the sale of assets during 2005. The gain on sale of real estate assets for the year ended December 31, 2004 was due primarily to a gain of $1,920 on the
sale of our joint venture interest in a property in Laguna Hills, California in August 2004.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2004 to the Year Ended December 31, 2003

Overview

Results for the year ended December 31, 2004 included the operations of 147 properties, seven of which were deconsolidated during 2004 (128 of which were
consolidated and 19 of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2003, which included the operations of 94
properties (57 of which were consolidated and 37 of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method). Results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 include the
results of six properties in which we did not own any interest
and one where we sold our joint venture interest in 2004. These properties were consolidated as a result of guarantees and/or puts for which we were liable. Five of the six properties were
deconsolidated on August 16, 2004 upon the release of all guarantees and puts, and the other property was deconsolidated on December 31, 2004. Results for both periods also included
equity in earnings of real estate ventures, third-party management fees, acquisition fees and development fees.

Property Rental—

The increase in property rental revenues consisted primarily of $8,081 from the buyout of the certain joint
venture interests (previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting), $16,777 from new acquisitions and $4,045 from increases in occupancy at lease-up properties. During the
year ended December 31, 2004, the Company and the Predecessor opened five new properties, acquired 44 new properties, and continued to increase the occupancy at its other lease-up
properties. The increase in stabilized property revenues consists primarily of increased rental rates.


Management and Franchise Fees—

Management and franchise fees represented 6.0% of cash collected from properties owned by third
parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. The decrease in management fees was due to the Company's purchase of our joint venture partner's interest in Extra Space East One, LLC in 2004.

Acquisition and Development Fees—

The increase in acquisition fees and development fees was due to the increased volume of
development relating to joint ventures in 2004. While the Company and the Predecessor purchased 44 properties in 2004, we did not recognize any acquisition fees as these properties are wholly owned
and are consolidated.

Other Income—

Other income represented primarily income from truck rentals.

Property Operations—

The increase in property operations expense was primarily due to increases of $2,654 from the buyout of
certain joint venture interests (previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting), $6,306 from new acquisitions and $2,238 from lease-up properties. During the year ended
December 31, 2004, the Company and the Predecessor opened five new properties, acquired 44 new properties, and continued to increase the occupancy at its other lease-up properties.
Existing lease-up property expenses increased due to increases in utilities, office expenses, repairs and maintenance and property taxes due to reassessment. The increase in stabilized
property expenses consisted primarily of payroll and property taxes.

Unrecovered Development/Acquisition Costs and Support Payments—

Unrecovered development costs for 2003 included $1,520 relating
to final performance guarantee payments to the joint venture partner in Extra Space West One, LLC and Extra Space East One, LLC. In addition, the decrease was due to approximately $2,500 in costs
relating to potential acquisitions, which were written off during the year ended December 31, 2003.

General and Administrative—

The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 is due to fewer
internal development expenses capitalized in 2004—$1,198, than were capitalized in 2003—$1,797, and to overhead added to prepare for growth, and our ongoing public company
costs. In addition, we recognized $1,205 in compensation expense related to employee unit grants in 2004.

Depreciation and Amortization—

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense results from more properties being open
due to development and acquisition during 2004, than were open


during
the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company and the Predecessor acquired 44 properties, bought out joint venture partners on 22 properties and opened five properties in 2004.

Interest Expense and Loss on Debt Extinguishments—

The increase in interest expense and loss on debt extinguishments was due
primarily to additional debt and interest relating to new properties entering the lease-up stage being expensed rather than capitalized (interest
was capitalized during the development phase) and $3,523 being paid to extinguish debt. Capitalized interest during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $1,213 and $2,593,
respectively. In addition, during 2004, the Company and the Predecessor acquired 44 new properties and bought out joint venture partners on 22 properties, which increased its average outstanding debt.

Minority Interest—Fidelity Preferred Return—

The decrease in minority interest—Fidelity preferred
return for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 was due to the redemption of the Fidelity minority interest on August 17, 2004.

Minority Interest Operating Partnership—

Loss allocated to the Operating Partnership represents 8.05% of the net loss
subsequent to the IPO and totaled $113 for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Loss Allocated to Other Minority Interests—

The increase in loss allocated to other minority interests in 2004 compared to 2003
was primarily due to additional losses on lease-up properties allocated to Extra Space Development ("ESD") in 2004 under the joint venture operating agreements.

Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Ventures—

Equity in earnings of real estate ventures decreased in 2004 primarily due to the
Predecessor purchasing its joint venture partner's interest in 18 self-storage facilities held by Extra Space Storage East One, LLC and these facilities being subsequently consolidated,
offset by increased profitability of Extra Space West One, LLC.

Gain on Sale of Real Estate Assets—

The increase in gain on sale of real estate assets was due primarily to a gain of $1,920 on
the sale of our joint venture interest in a property in Laguna Hills, California in August 2004.


FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

FFO provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net loss and cash flows, for an understanding of
our operating results. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ("NAREIT") as net income (loss) computed in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and
joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net loss and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented
in the consolidated financial statements.

The
computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that
interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative
to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activates as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash
distributions. The following table sets for the calculation of FFO:

CCS and CCU Property Performance:

As described in our prospectus for our IPO, upon the achievement of certain levels of net operating income with respect to 14 of our pre-stabilized
properties, our CCSs and our operating partnership's CCUs will convert into additional shares of common stock and OP units, respectively, beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2006. The
average occupancy of these 14 properties as of December 31, 2005 was 71.1% as compared to 59.1% at December 31, 2004. The table below outlines the performance of the properties for the
quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

CASH FLOWS

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2005 to the Year Ended December 31, 2004

Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities were $14,771 and ($6,158) for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase
in cash provided by operating activities was due to the addition of new stabilized properties through the SUSA acquisition and other acquisitions. There have also been lower cash funding requirements
relating to our lease-up properties as occupancy has increased.

Cash
used in investing activities was ($614,834) and ($261,298) for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 is primarily the result of the
$530,972 of cash paid in the acquisition of Storage USA. This increase was offset by the fact that we acquired fewer other properties and had fewer development projects during 2005 compared to 2004.
We also received payments of $26,783 related to the notes receivable acquired in conjunction with the SUSA transaction during 2005.

Cash
provided by financing activities was $604,387 and $280,039 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 financing activities consisted primarily of
net proceeds from share issuances of $271,537, additional borrowings of $808,936, including borrowings to fund the SUSA acquisition, offset by the repayment of $431,255 of line of credit and notes
payable. The 2004 financial activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from share issuances of $264,475, additional borrowings of $418,154, including borrowings to fund the purchase of 44
stabilized properties and the development of existing projects, offset by the repayment of $325,917 of borrowings.

2005 OPERATIONAL SUMMARY

2005 proved to be both a rewarding and challenging year for us. During the course of the year, we became the second largest operator of self-storage
in the United States with the acquisition of SUSA,


and
faced the expected challenges of a complex integration while attempting to maximize operational performance in a competitive marketplace.

The
SUSA acquisition took center stage in 2005 and commanded a majority of our efforts throughout the year, especially during the second and third quarters. Our operating results were
positive, as revenue levels increased compared to those seen in 2004. However, our operational performance lagged internal expectations during the first six months of 2005 due to the resources
required to close and integrate the SUSA acquisition.

Operational
performance improved significantly in the last six months of the year, largely due to the impact of the newly acquired SUSA properties and more aggressive pricing and
discounting strategies instituted by RevMan. Mission critical business processes were completed shortly after the closing of the transaction, and the majority of the integration has been completed. As
a result of completing this integration, we are hopeful that the recent performance trend will continue.

The
Florida and California markets were among our strongest performing markets, both before and after the SUSA acquisition. After the acquisition, our newly strengthened markets of
Phoenix, Las Vegas and Washington D.C. were also recognized for their strong revenue growth. Metro-Chicago, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania were among our weakest performing markets.

Competitive
pressure remains a factor to performance. However, due to the strength of self-storage fundamentals in many markets, the ability to raise rental rates continues
to be evident. Despite these increases, many competitors are continuing with high levels of rental discounts, which act as a drag on revenue.

On
a same-store basis for our pre-SUSA, legacy properties, we experienced increased rental activity compared to 2004, while move-out activity was
slightly lower. The SUSA properties experienced increased rental activity compared to 2004, while move-out activity was slightly lower.

OUTLOOK

We anticipate continued strength in self-storage fundamentals due to positive economic conditions in many of our core markets. We believe that the
ability to increase revenues in 2006 over levels achieved in 2005 exists.

We
have seen improvement in our recent year-on-year performance with both occupancy and revenue. Though there can be no assurance that this trend will continue,
we believe that positive economic conditions, the quality and location of our property portfolio and the combination of technology and RevMan, with its ability to implement real-time
pricing and promotions, will provide us with the opportunity to grow revenues in 2006.

We
anticipate continued competition from all operators, both public and private, in all of the markets in which we operate. Despite this, we expect a positive operating environment for
self-storage operators, particularly for those with well-located, highly visible, and efficiently managed self-storage properties. We will continue to enhance
operational processes and implement technology to maximize our effectiveness as an operator.

REVENUE OUTLOOK

Increased revenues were seen by many operators in 2005. This was also true for us, as was illustrated by positive same-store revenue growth. The
ability for us to leverage RevMan and our technology platform gives us a positive revenue outlook for 2006. We aim to achieve not the highest level of occupancy, but the highest sustainable level of
revenue to increase stockholder value. This may mean lower occupancy levels when compared on a year-on-year basis. We will also selectively discount


certain
sites and units based on occupancy, availability, and competitive parameters that are controlled through our point of sale software and RevMan.

Rental
discounts were flat in 2005 on our same-store portfolio compared to 2004 and remains an important factor for us. Our evolving system of analyzing different data as it
relates to site performance, competitive variables and operational experience will drive site-level and portfolio performance in the future. The ability to proactively control discounts
also rests upon the site management team, and we are developing several initiatives to assist our field personnel in this regard.

With
the acquisition of SUSA and our increased scale, advertising opportunities that only a few self-storage companies currently possess are now available to us. We will
continue to look at communication tools that stretch marketing dollars further while investigating marketing channels to better communicate our services to prospective customers. Online marketing and
commercial sales are two marketing programs that will be much more prominent in 2006, especially since the acquisition of SUSA. These programs were heavily utilized at SUSA, and we believe that they
will have a positive affect on our ability to maximize revenues over time.

EXPENSE OUTLOOK

Property taxes, utilities and repairs and maintenance were the main components of 2005's increased operating expenses. As we continue to acquire existing
self-storage facilities, tax reassessments will continue to occur. Snow removal was the main factor behind the increase in repairs and maintenance and is largely uncontrollable. National
vendor programs have and will continue to be pursued which may drive down the cost of facility maintenance due to increased scale. We are not forecasting any major increase in repairs and maintenance
in 2005. We believe that through continued refinement of insurance and risk management processes that insurance costs can also be reduced.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $28,653 available in cash and cash equivalents. We will be required to distribute at least 90% of our net
taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We intend to use this cash to purchase additional self-storage
properties in the first quarter of 2006. Therefore, it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs. Instead, these needs must be met from
cash generated from operations and external sources of capital.

On
September 9, 2004, we, as guarantor, and our Operating Partnership entered into a $100 million revolving line of credit ("Credit Facility"), which includes a
$10 million swingline sub facility. The Credit Facility is collateralized by self-storage properties. The Operating Partnership intends to use the proceeds of the Credit Facility
for general corporate purposes and acquisitions. As of December 31, 2005, the Credit Facility had approximately $76.1 million of available borrowings based on the assets collateralizing
the Credit Facility. There was no principal balance outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2005.

On
October 4, 2004, we entered into a reverse interest rate swap with U.S. Bank National Association, relating to our existing $61,770 fixed rate mortgage with Wachovia Bank,
which is due 2009. Pursuant to the swap agreement, we will receive fixed interest payments of 4.30% and pay variable interest
payments based on the one-month LIBOR plus .655% on a notional amount of $61,770. There were no origination fees or other up front costs incurred by us in connection with the swap
agreement.

As
of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $866.8 million of debt, resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of 52.1%. As of December 31, 2005, the ratio
of total fixed rate debt and other instruments to total debt is 89.1%. The weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed and variable rate debt at December 31, 2005 is 5.3%.


We expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of
OP units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Facility.

Long-Term Liquidity Needs

Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of distributions to stockholders, new facility development, property acquisitions, principal payments
under our borrowings and non-recurring capital expenditures. We do not expect that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our long term liquidity needs and instead expect to
fund such needs out of additional borrowings, joint ventures with third parties, and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt. We may also use OP Units as currency to fund
acquisitions from self-storage owners who desire tax-deferral in their exiting transactions.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships,
such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or
other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have
any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in
these relationships.

FINANCING STRATEGY

We will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors. Although our board of directors
has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the
amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate. In making financing decisions, our board of directors will consider factors including but not limited to:

•

the
interest rate of the proposed financing;

•

the
extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our properties;

•

prepayment
penalties and restrictions on refinancing;


•

the
purchase price of properties acquired with debt financing;

•

long-term
objectives with respect to the financing;

•

target
investment returns;

•

the
ability of particular properties, and the Company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments;

•

overall
level of consolidated indebtedness;

•

timing
of debt and lease maturities;

•

provisions
that require recourse and cross-collateralization;

•

corporate
credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets; and

•

the
overall ratio of fixed- and variable-rate debt.

Our
indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse or cross-collateralized. If the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular
properties to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in properties subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our properties, or may refinance
properties acquired on a leveraged basis. We may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing properties,
for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable.

The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September.
Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been as of the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter may not be
indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share—Based Payment,"
("SFAS 123(R)") which requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and
disallows the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, but expresses no preference for a type of valuation model. This statement supersedes APB No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," but does not change the accounting guidance for share—based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in SFAS No. 123 as originally
issued. SFAS 123 (R) is effective for our year beginning January 1, 2006. We intend to use the "modified—prospective" method to report stock compensation upon
adoption of SFAS 123(R). The stock-based compensation expense for 2006 is not expected to be materially different than the pro forma expense disclosed for 2005 under APB No. 25. We will
allocate the expense for unvested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006 over the vesting period, unless the options are forfeited.

In
June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") released Issue No. 04-5, "Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group,
Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights" (EITF 04-05"). EITF 04-05 creates a framework for evaluating whether a general
partner or a group of general partners controls a limited partnership and therefore should consolidate the partnership. EITF 04-05 states that the presumption of general partner control
would be overcome only when the limited partners have certain specific rights as outlined in EITF 04-05. EITF 04-05 is effective immediately for all newly formed limited
partnerships and for existing limited partnership agreements that are modified. For general partners in all other limited partnerships, EITF 04-05 is effective no later than the beginning
of the first reporting


period
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Currently, this guidance will not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or statement of cash
flows.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future income, cash flows and fair values of financial
instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political
considerations and other factors beyond our control.

As
of December 31, 2005, we had $866.8 million in total debt of which $94.2 million is subject to variable interest rates (including the $61.8 million on
which we have the reverse interest rate swap). If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or
decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.0 million annually.

Interest
rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change
in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty
of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.

The
fair value of fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at December 31, 2005 was $750,527. The carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable at
December 31, 2005 was $772,570.

Extra Space Storage Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2005

(Dollars in thousands, except shares and per share data)

1.     DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business

Extra Space Storage Inc. (the "Company") is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"), formed as a
Maryland Corporation on April 30, 2004 to own, operate, manage, acquire and develop self-storage facilities located throughout the United States. The Company continues the business
of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries (the "Predecessor"), which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. The Company's interest in its properties is held through its
operating partnership, Extra Space Storage LP (the "Operating Partnership"), which was formed on May 5, 2004. The Company's primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in
the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be subject to tax, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.

The
Company invests in self-storage facilities by acquiring or developing wholly-owned facilities or by acquiring an equity interest in real estate entities. At
December 31, 2005, the Company had direct and indirect equity interests in 546 storage facilities located in 34 states, including Washington D.C.

The
Company operates in two distinct segments: (1) property management and development; and (2) rental operations. The Company's property management and development
activities include acquiring, managing, developing and selling self-storage facilities. The rental operations activities include rental operations of self-storage facilities.
No single tenant accounts for more than 5% of rental income.

Initial Public Offering

On August 17, 2004, the Company completed its initial public offering (the "Offering") of 20,200,000 shares of common stock, with proceeds to the Company
of $234,825, net of offering costs of $17,675. As part of the offering, the Company granted the underwriters the right to purchase an additional 3,030,000 shares within 30 days after the
Offering to cover over-allotments. On September 1, 2004, the underwriters exercised their right and purchased 3,030,000 shares of common stock with proceeds to the Company of
$35,224, net of offering costs of $2,651. The Company also paid additional offering costs of $5,574 as part of the Offering.

In
connection with the Offering, the existing holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class E Units in the Predecessor exchanged these units for an aggregate
of 7,939,950 shares of common stock, 1,608,437 Operating Partnership ("OP") units, 3,888,843 contingent conversion shares ("CCSs"), 200,046 contingent conversion units ("CCUs") and $18,885 in cash. As
a result of this exchange, the Predecessor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2005, the Operating Partnership is a 93.12% subsidiary of the
Company. The transaction did not result in a change in the carrying value of the Predecessor's assets and liabilities because the exchange was accounted for at historical cost as a transfer of assets
between companies under common control.


2.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2004
through August 16, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003 and the results of operations and financial condition of the Company subsequent to the Offering.

The
consolidated financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly or majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The
Company follows FASB Interpretation No. 46R, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46R"), which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities
("VIEs"). Under FIN 46R, arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as VIEs. An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary
beneficiary of the VIE.

Under
FIN 46R, a VIE is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support from other parties, or (ii) the entity's equity holders as a group either: (a) lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or similar
rights, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an
entity is deemed to be a VIE pursuant to FIN 46R, the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of the VIE is considered
the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.

Based
on the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company has concluded that under certain circumstances when the Company (i) enters into option agreements for the purchase of land or
facilities from an entity and pays a non-refundable deposit, or (ii) enters into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition
(ii) (b) or (c) of the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, the Company has considered expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as
outlined in FIN 46R. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with the Company's financial statements.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Real Estate Assets

Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development, construction,
renovation, and improvement of real estate assets


are
capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized. Capitalized interest during the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $460, $1,213 and $2,593, respectively.

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are
generally between 5 and 39 years.

In
connection with the Company's acquisition of properties, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair
values. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, are determined as if vacant, that is, at replacement cost. Intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant
relationships, are recorded at their estimated fair values. The Company measures the value of tenant relationships based on the Company's historical experience with turnover in its facilities. The
Company amortizes to expense the tenant relationships on a straight-line basis over the average period that a tenant is expected to utilize the facility (currently estimated to
be18 months).

Intangible
lease rights represent purchase price amounts allocated to leases on two properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases. These rights are amortized to
expense over the life of the lease.

Evaluation of Asset Impairment

The Company evaluates long-lived assets which are held for use for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment.
When such an event occurs, the Company compares the carrying value of these long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment
loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the asset. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net
carrying value over the related fair value of the asset. Management has determined no property was impaired and no impairment charges have been recognized for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

When
real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value, net of selling costs. If the
estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, then a valuation allowance is established. Management
has determined no property was held for sale at December 31, 2005. The operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as discontinued operations for all periods
presented.

Investments in Real Estate Ventures

The Company's investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control and joint ventures which are VIEs in which
the Company is not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.


Under
the equity method, the Company's investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for the Company's share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions.
Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on the Company's ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the purposes of
presentation in the statement of cash flows, the Company follows the "look through" approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported
under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds
from the joint venture's sale of assets) in which case it is reported as an investing activity.

Management
assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company's investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired when events or circumstances
indicate that there may be an impairment. An investment is impaired if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred,
and it is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. No impairment charges were
recognized for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company's cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States of America and at times may exceed federally insured limits. The
Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash is comprised of escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions located in various states relating to earnest money deposits on potential
acquisitions, real estate taxes, insurance, capital expenditures and lease liabilities. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company has debt agreements that require the Company to have
unrestricted cash of $1,500 available at all times.

Other Assets

Other assets consist primarily of equipment and fixtures, deferred financing costs, accounts receivable, investment in trusts, prepaid expenses, and deferred
advertising costs. Depreciation of equipment and fixtures is computed on a straight-line basis over three to seven years. Deferred financing costs are amortized to interest expense
using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective debt agreements. Deferred direct response advertising costs are amortized to property operating expenses over a thirty-month period
on a straight-line basis.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the
derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment


attributable
to a particular risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are
considered cash flow hedges.

For
derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss), outside of earnings and subsequently
reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other financial instruments included in other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses,
variable rate notes payable and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2005 and 2004 approximate the fair values. The fair value of fixed rate notes
payable and notes payable to trusts at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $750,527 and $333,579, respectively. The carrying value of these fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts at
December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $772,570 and $340,669, respectively.

Conversion of Operating Partnership Units

Conversions of Operating Partnership units to common stock, when converted under the original provisions of the agreement, are accounted for by reclassifying the
underlying net book value of the units from minority interest to equity in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-7, "Implementation Issues Related to the Treatment
of Minority Interest in Certain Real Estate Investment Trusts."

Revenue and Expense Recognition

Rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally on month-to-month
terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Property expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other cost to
manage the facilities are recognized as incurred.

Management
and franchise fee revenue and tenant insurance revenue are recognized when earned. Development and acquisition fee revenue is recognized as development costs are incurred.

Real Estate Sales

The Company evaluates real estate sales for both sale recognition and profit recognition in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66, "Accounting for
Sales of Real Estate". In general, sales of real estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition; other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit
recognition.

The
Predecessor periodically sold properties into real estate joint ventures or identified properties for acquisition by newly formed joint ventures in which it retained an interest. In
connection with


certain
of these transactions, the Predecessor and/or a significant unit holder provided certain financial guarantees to the lender; or to support a put right on a portion of the joint venture
partner's interest that effectively provided for a return on and of their investment. These arrangements preclude sale accounting under SFAS No. 66 and, accordingly, the Predecessor has
reflected these transactions using the financing method set forth in SFAS No. 66. Under this method, the putable portions of these joint ventures partners' interests are reflected as
liabilities; the initial fair value of the joint venture partners' non-putable residual interests are reflected as minority interests with offsetting discounts attributed to the
liabilities associated with the putable interests, "putable preferred interests in consolidated joint ventures." These discounts are amortized using the effective interest method over the period until
the relevant put first becomes exercisable (generally a period of three to five years depending on the terms of the individual transaction). The preferred return on the putable interest
liabilities, plus the amortization of the discounts, is reflected as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The joint venture partners are allocated their proportionate share
of any profits, except that losses may not be allocated in excess of the originally ascribed basis. Concurrent with the Offering, the Company redeemed all putable interest liabilities by purchasing
100% of its partners' interest in these properties.

Advertising Costs

The Company incurs advertising costs primarily attributable to directory, direct mail, internet and other advertising. Direct response advertising costs were
deferred and amortized to expense during the years ending December 31, 2004 and 2003. The Company recognized $4,374, $2,950 and $1,902 in advertising expense for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). In order to
maintain its qualification as a REIT, among other things, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature
of its income and assets. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to the
stockholders. The Company plans to continue to operate so that it meets the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If the Company
were to fail to meet these requirements, the Company would be subject to federal income tax. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in real
estate and other taxes in the Company's
consolidated statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2005, 100% (unaudited) of all distributions to stockholders qualify as a return of capital.

The
Company has elected to treat one of its existing corporate subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS"). In general, a TRS of the Company may perform additional services for
tenants of the Company and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business (except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging
facilities or the provision to any person, under a franchise, license or otherwise, of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated). A TRS is subject
to corporate federal income tax.


The
TRS has minimal book and tax income and has not recorded tax amounts under SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," due to the amounts not being material.

Prior
to August 17, 2004, the Company elected to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes. The tax effects of the Company's operations were passed directly to members.
Therefore, no provisions for income taxes were recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor.

Stock-Based Compensation

As permitted by SFAS No.123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation-Transition and
Disclosure—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123," the Company has elected to measure and record compensation cost relative to employee stock option costs in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations and make pro forma disclosures of net loss and basic and diluted loss
per share as if the fair value method of valuing stock options had been applied. Under ABP No. 25, compensation cost is recognized for stock options granted to employees when the option price
is less than the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the Company applies SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, which requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the
employee stock options at the grant date using an option-pricing model. The Company recorded deferred stock compensation in stockholders' equity equal to the market value of the restricted shares on
the date of grant and amortizes deferred stock compensation to expense over the vesting period.

The
following table represents the effect on net loss and loss per share as if the Company had applied the fair value based method and recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as
amended:

The

Net Loss Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average common shares outstanding, less unvested restricted
stock. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share measures the performance of the Company over the reporting period while giving effect to all potential common shares that were dilutive and outstanding
during the period. The denominator includes the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares that were dilutive had been issued and is calculated
using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares are securities (such as options, warrants, convertible debt, and convertible OP units) that do not have a current right to participate in
earnings but could do so in the future by virtue of their option or conversion right. In computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the number (i.e. net income or loss) is adjusted to
add back any changes in earnings (loss) in the period associated with the convertible security. The numerator also is adjusted for the effects of any other non-discretionary changes in
income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares. In computing diluted earnings (loss) per share, only potential common shares that are dilutive, those
that reduce earnings (loss) per share, are included. Since the Company generated a loss for 2005, the impact of inclusion of the potential conversion of securities into common shares is
anti-dilutive and therefore diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share. Excluded from the computation of diluted common shares outstanding are: 173,750 shares of
restricted stock grants, 3,032,398 stock options, and 3,825,787 convertible OP units.

For
the periods prior to the Offering, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding includes Class A units as if the Class A units had been converted to common
stock using the initial public offering conversion ratio of one Class A unit to 0.08 shares of common stock. Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net the loss
attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average shares outstanding. The net loss attributable to common stockholders represents the net loss, less the preferred return payable by the
Predecessor on Class B, C and E units, less the loss on early redemption of Fidelity minority interest. The loss on early redemption of Fidelity minority interest represents additional
preferred return paid to Fidelity for the period between the redemption date of September 9, 2004 and November 25, 2004. The amount was paid based on the agreement whereby Fidelity was
entitled to a preferred return through November 25, 2004, regardless of the redemption date.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment,"
("SFAS 123(R)") which requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and
disallows the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, but expresses no preference for a type of valuation model. This statement supersedes APB No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," but does not change the accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in SFAS No. 123 as originally issued.
SFAS 123 (R) is effective for the Company's year beginning January 1, 2006. The Company intends to use the "modified-prospective" method to report stock compensation upon adoption
of SFAS 123(R). The stock-based compensation expense for 2006 is not expected to be materially different than the pro forma expense disclosed for 2005 under APB No. 25. The Company will
allocate the


expense
for unvested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006 over the vesting period, unless the options are forfeited.

In
June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") released Issue No. 04-5, "Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group,
Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights" (EITF 04-05"). EITF 04-05 creates a framework for evaluating whether a general
partner or a group of general partners controls a limited partnership and therefore should consolidate the partnership. EITF 04-05 states that the presumption of general partner control
would be overcome only when the limited partners have certain specific rights as outlined in EITF 04-05. EITF 04-05 is effective immediately for all newly formed limited
partnerships and for existing limited partnership agreements that are modified. For general partners in all other limited partnerships, EITF 04-05 is effective no later than the beginning
of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Currently, this guidance will not materially affect the Company's consolidated financial position,
results of operations or statement of cash flows.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 2004 and 2003 financial statements and supporting note disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation,
including the reclassification of interest income from total revenues to other revenue and expenses. Such reclassification did not impact previously reported net loss or accumulated deficit.

(18 months). The Company amortizes to expense the intangible lease rights over the term of the lease (5 years). Amortization related to the tenant relationships and lease rights was
$10,345 and $3,404 for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The majority balance of the unamortized tenant relationships at December 31, 2005 will be amortized in 2006. The remaining balance of the
unamortized lease rights will be amortized over the next 12 to 23 years.


4.     BUSINESS ACQUISITION

To expand its business, on July 14, 2005, the Company, through its subsidiary Extra Space Storage LLC ("ESS LLC") and the Operating Partnership, closed the
acquisition (the "Transaction") of various entities that collectively comprise the Storage USA self-storage business pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Agreement"), dated
May 5, 2005, between ESS LLC, the Operating Partnership, Security Capital Self Storage Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, PRISA Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("PRISA"), PRISA II Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("PRISA II"), PRISA III Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("PRISA III"), VRS Self Storage LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company ("VRS"), WCOT Self Storage LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("WCOT"), and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, a New Jersey corporation (together
with its affiliates, "Prudential").

In
connection with the Transaction, the Company acquired 61 wholly-owned self storage properties, acquired Storage USA ("SUSA") Partnership, L.P.'s equity interest in joint ventures
which collectively owned 78 properties and assumed the management of 60 franchises and third party owned properties. In addition, 259 of the self-storage properties were acquired in the
Transaction by five separate limited liability companies owned by five subsidiaries of the Company (each, a "Company Sub") and Prudential. The limited liability company agreements govern the rights
and responsibilities of each such limited liability company. The Company also acquired $37.7 million of notes receivable due from franchisees.

The
total purchase cost for SUSA of approximately $585.7 million consists of the following:

In
these joint ventures, the Company and the joint venture partner generally receive a preferred return on their invested capital. To the extent that cash/profits in excess of these
preferred returns are generated through operations or capital transactions, the Company would receive a higher percentage of the excess cash/profits than its equity interest.

During
the first and second quarter 2004, the Predecessor held a minority investment in Extra Space East One LLC ("ESE"). The Predecessor acquired its joint venture partner's interest in
ESE on May 4, 2004. Subsequent to the acquisition of its partner's joint venture interest in ESE, the Company has consolidated the properties previously owned by ESE.

To
the extent that properties were sold/transferred into these ventures where such transactions did not qualify for sales treatment, those properties are reflected as being owned by the
Predecessor in the consolidated financial statements with the joint venture partners' interests in these properties reflected as minority interests and putable preferred interests in consolidated
joint ventures. There were no such transactions for the years ended December 31, 2005 or 2004.

7.     NOTES RECEIVABLE

Notes receivable relate to construction advances SUSA had offered to certain franchisees. All properties are now in their operating phase. The notes are
collateralized by the franchised properties and have terms up to five years. Interest payments are generally due monthly on the notes during the first two years of the term, with
amortization of principal generally commencing in the third year based upon a 25-year schedule with the balance due at the due date. The loans bear interest based on a spread over the
prime interest rate of 0.5% to 1.0%. Typically, advances represented 70%-90% of the anticipated cost of the project.

Management
periodically assesses historical payment history, payment status, prevailing economic and business conditions, specific loan terms and other relevant factors to determine
whether any notes receivable should be placed on non-accrual status or otherwise adjusted for impairment. At December 31, 2005, none of the notes receivables are considered
impaired.

Real
estate assets are pledged as collateral for the notes payable. The Company is subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to the outstanding notes payable. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2005.

In
October 2004, the Company entered into a reverse interest rate swap agreement ("Swap Agreement") to float $61,770 of 4.30% fixed interest rate secured notes due in
June 2009. Under this Swap Agreement, the Company will receive interest at a fixed rate of 4.30% and pay interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.655%. The Swap Agreement matures at
the same time the notes are due. This Swap Agreement is a fair value hedge, as defined by SFAS No. 133, and the fair value of the Swap Agreement is recorded as an asset or liability, with an
offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related note payable. Monthly variable interest payments are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest expense.

The
estimated fair value of the Swap Agreement at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was reflected as an other liability of $2,151 and $532, respectively. For the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004 interest expense has been reduced by $70 and $243, respectively, as a result of the Swap Agreement.

During
the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company and the Predecessor refinanced approximately $143,840 of borrowings. As a result of these refinancings, approximately $819 of
unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the loans that were repaid was written off, and approximately $5,687 of defeasance costs was paid. Defeasance costs of $3,523 are included in loss
on debt extinguishments in the consolidated statement of operations. An additional $2,164 of defeasance costs was included in the purchase price of property acquisitions.

On
July 14, 2005, the Company entered into $313,000 of new mortgages which are collateralized by 57 of the 61 wholly-owned properties purchased in conjunction with the SUSA
acquisition. These mortgages bear interest at fixed rates of 5.26% or 5.29% and mature in five or 10 years after inception.

On
August 27, 2004, the Company entered into a new $111,000 senior 4.65% fixed rate mortgage in conjunction with the purchase of 26 self-storage properties.

On
August 26, 2004, the Company closed a $37,000 variable rate mortgage. This mortgage is collateralized by five properties and bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR
plus 1.75% and matures in three years after inception with a two-year extension available at the Company's option.

Under
FIN 46R, Trust, Trust II and Trust III are VIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary. A debt obligation has been recorded in the form of
notes as discussed above for the proceeds, which are owed to the Trust, Trust II, and Trust III by the Company.

11.   LINE OF CREDIT

The Company, as guarantor, and its Operating Partnership have entered into a $100.0 million revolving line of credit, which includes a $10.0 million
swingline subfacility (the "Credit Facility").

The
Credit Facility has an interest rate of 175 basis points over LIBOR (6.14% and 4.15% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively). The Operating Partnership intends to use the

principal balance on the line of credit at December, 2005 and 2004 was $0 and $39.0 million, respectively. The maturity date on the line of credit is September 2007. The
Credit Facility is collateralized by mortgages on certain real estate assets.

12.   PUTABLE PREFERRED INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER MINORITY INTERESTS

On August 17, 2004, the Company purchased its joint venture partner's 49.5% interest in Extra Space Properties Three, LLC. Prior to the purchase of its
joint venture partner's interest, the Predecessor owned a 50.5% interest in Extra Space Properties Three, LLC. This arrangement provided for a preferred return of 12% on certain capital provided by
both the Predecessor and the joint venture partner, and thereafter returns were split based upon percentage residual interests.

The
Company also purchased its joint venture partner's interests in 15 other self-storage facilities on August 17, 2004. The Predecessor had entered into these joint
venture agreements with other entities controlled by Equibase Mini Warehouse. These arrangements provided for a preferred return of either 10% or 12%, depending on the specific agreement, on certain
capital provided by the joint venture partner and thereafter returns were split based on the indicated percentage interests (generally 40% to the Predecessor and 60% to the investors).

Prior
to the buyout of the Predecessor's joint ventures partners (entities controlled by Equibase Mini Warehouse), the Predecessor and/or a significant unit holder provided certain
financial guarantees to the secured lender (generally providing for performance under the loan, including principal and interest payments), or to support a put right on a portion of the joint venture
partner's interest after a fixed period (generally either three or five years), that effectively provided for a return on and of the preferred portion of their investment. In addition, after a
fixed period (generally either three or five years), the joint venture had the right to redeem the preferred capital at an amount equal to its unreturned contribution plus any accrued preferred
return. Upon exercise of the put or call on the preferred portion of their investment, the joint venture investors would continue to hold their residual equity interests. As a result of the put rights
and guarantees, the Predecessor consolidated the properties and related debt until the put rights and guarantees were satisfied or have expired. At December 31, 2003, all the joint venture
properties were consolidated. The financial guarantees to the secured lender would generally expire upon satisfaction of the related loan at maturity or refinancing. The put rights and related
guarantees had no stated maturity and would only expire upon exercise or through redemption of the preferred interests through a capital event.

On
August 17, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of joint venture interests held by Equibase Mini Warehouse and its affiliates in seven joint ventures, which currently
own an aggregate of 30 self-storage properties, for an aggregate of approximately $35,800 in cash and 114,928 OP units issued by the Operating Partnership valued at $1,437.

Upon
completion of the Offering, the Company was released from all puts and guarantees relating to the remaining Equibase joint ventures. These guarantees and puts were transferred to
Extra Space Development and a stockholder of the Company. Accordingly, these properties were deconsolidated as of August 17, 2004. The operating results through August 16, 2004 relating
to the properties that were deconsolidated are included in the consolidated statements of operations.


During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company reflected interest expense on the putable preferred interests of $0, $4,227 and
$4,951, respectively, including amortization of discounts ascribed at issuance of $0, $1,043 and $1,311, respectively.

During
the formation of ESE and ESW, the Predecessor agreed to guarantee the financial performance of certain properties, which were acquired on behalf of those entities. As a result of
these guarantees, the Predecessor consolidated these properties until these performance guarantees were satisfied or expired. During 2003, the guarantees related to two properties were either
satisfied or expired. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Predecessor recognized $1,283 of expense related to these guarantees. These amounts are classified as a component of
unrecovered development / acquisition costs and support payments. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no active guarantees related to these properties.

During
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, management fee expense of $2,775 and $7,933, respectively, was recorded for services provided to support the Company's
and the Predecessor's self-storage facilities by Extra Space Management, Inc. ("ESMI"), a corporation that shared common ownership with the Predecessor, including stockholders who
were officers of the Predecessor. Under this agreement, ESMI provided employees who supported the operations of existing self-storage facilities and the acquisition and development of new
self-storage facilities by the Predecessor. On March 31, 2004, the Predecessor purchased all of the outstanding common stock of ESMI for its net book value of $184. ESMI had
equipment and fixtures of $256, other assets of $736 and liabilities of $808.

Real
estate under development includes capitalized internal development costs paid by ESMI on behalf of the Company of $1,198 and $1,797 for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Other
receivables from properties consist of amounts due for expenses paid on behalf of the properites that the Company manages and management fees. Receivables from Prudential relating
to SUSA acquisition represents amounts receivable from Prudential for general and administrative expenses, severance paid, and lease expenses paid relating to the SUSA acquisition. The Company
believes that all of these related party receivables are fully collectible. The Company does not have any payables to related parties at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

On
January 1, 2004, the Predecessor distributed its equity ownership in Extra Space Development LLC ("ESD"), a consolidated subsidiary, to its Class A members. ESD owned 13
early-stage development properties, two parcels of undeveloped land, and a note receivable. The net book value of the distributed properties and related liabilities was approximately $15,000. The
Predecessor retained a receivable of $6,212 from ESD and recorded a net distribution of $9,000. In September 2004, ESD repaid the amounts due the Company using funds obtained through new loans
on unencumbered properties. The Predecessor was required to continue consolidating certain of the properties due to financial guarantees. Concurrent with the initial public offering, the Company was
released from all guarantees, and the properties were deconsolidated as of August 16, 2004.

The
Company has determined that it has a variable interest in properties in which ESD owns or has an ownership interest. The Company does not have an equity investment or interest, and
it is not the primary beneficiary. This variable interest is a result of management and development contracts that are held by the Company. The variable interest is limited to the management and
development


fees
and there is not any additional loss that can be attributed to the Company. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary in these agreements. Accordingly, these properties
have not been consolidated subsequent to August 16, 2004.

On
January 1, 2004, the Predecessor distributed the $4,493 (including accrued interest of $438) note receivable from Centershift, related party software service provider, which is
partially owned by a certain director and members of management of the Company, to its Class A members. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company entered into a license agreement with
Centershift which secures a perpetual right for continued use of STORE (the site management software used at all sites operated by the Company) in all aspects of the Company's property acquisition,
development, redevelopment and operational activities. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company paid Centershift $739, $441 and $175, respectively, relating
to the purchase of software and to license agreements.

15.   MINORITY INTEREST IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

The Company's interest in its properties is held through the Operating Partnership. ESS Holding Business Trust I, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is the
sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. The Company through ESS Business Trust II, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is also a limited partner of the Operating Partnership. Between
its general partner and limited partner interests, the Company holds a 93.12% majority ownership interest therein as of December 31, 2005. The remaining ownership interests in the Operating
Partnership of 6.88% are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating Partnership, which include a director and officers of the Company. The Company and Operating Partnership were
formed to continue to operate and expand the business of the Predecessor.

The
minority interest in the Operating Partnership represents OP units that are not owned by the Company. In conjunction with the formation of the Company and as a result of subsequent
acquisitions, certain persons and entities contributing interests in properties to the Operating Partnership received limited partnership units. Limited partners who received OP units in the formation
transactions have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of their OP units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at
the time of the redemption. Alternatively, the Company may, at its option, elect to acquire those OP units in exchange for shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis,
subject to anti-dilution adjustments provided in the Operating Partnership agreement.

On
July 14, 2005 the Company issued 1,470,149 OP units valued at $21.6 million in conjunction with the Transaction. On September 9, 2005 and November 2, 2005,
350,000 and 50,000 OP units were redeemed in exchange for common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the Operating Partnership had 3,825,787 and 200,046 shares of OP units and CCUs
outstanding, respectively.

Unlike
the OP units, CCUs do not carry any voting rights. Upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to 14 early-stage lease-up properties, all or a
portion of the CCUs will be automatically converted into shares of the Company's common stock. Initially, each CCU will be convertible on a one-for-one basis into shares of
common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2006, and ending with the quarter ending December 31, 2008, the
Company will calculate the net operating income from the 14 wholly owned


early-stage
lease-up properties over the 12-month period ending in such quarter. Within 35 days following the end of each quarter referred to above, some or all of the
CCUs will be converted so that the total percentage (not to exceed 100%) of CCUs issued in connection with the formation transactions that have been converted to common stock will be equal to the
percentage determined by dividing the net operating income for such period in excess of $5.1 million by $4.6 million. If any CCU remains unconverted through the calculation made in
respect of the 12-month period ending December 31, 2008, such outstanding CCUs will be cancelled and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

While
any CCUs remain outstanding, a majority of the Company's independent directors must review and approve the net operating income calculation for each measurement period and also
must approve any sales of any of the 14 wholly-owned early-stage lease-up properties.

16.   REDEEMABLE MINORITY INTEREST—FIDELITY

Through December 31, 2003, the Predecessor, through a consolidated subsidiary, Extra Space Properties Four, LLC, had received net cash proceeds of $14,156
(net of transaction costs of $1,403) from FREAM No. 39, LLC and Fidelity Pension Fund Real Estate Investments (collectively, "Fidelity"). The Predecessor was accreting the discount related to
the transaction costs over the five-year period ending November 25, 2006; the first date the investment was redeemable by Fidelity.

This
investment earned a 22% preferred return, of which, 9% was payable quarterly with the remainder payable upon redemption. The earliest date at which the investment could be repaid
without penalty at the option of the Predecessor was November 25, 2004. The investment was redeemable November 25, 2006 at the option of Fidelity. As of December 31, 2003, the
Predecessor owed Fidelity $3,810, in
unpaid preferred return which had been accrued and was included in the redeemable minority interest-Fidelity.

On
September 9, 2004, the Operating Partnership completed its acquisition of the preferred equity interest held by Fidelity in Extra Space Properties Four LLC. This interest was
acquired for approximately $21,530 in cash, which included the preferred return through November 25, 2004. The Company recorded a loss on early redemption of $1,478.

17.   STOCKHOLDERS' AND MEMBERS' EQUITY

Stockholders' Equity

On December 9, 2005, the Company closed a public common stock offering of 13,800,000 shares at an offering price of $14.57 per share, for aggregate gross
proceeds of $201.1 million. Transaction costs were $10.9 million, resulting in net proceeds of $190.2 million. The proceeds were used to repay outstanding bridge and franchise
loans and for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and debt repayment.

On
June 20, 2005 the Company completed a private placement of 6,200,000 shares of its common stock at an offering price of $13.47 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of
$83.5 million. Transaction costs were $2.2 million, resulting in net proceeds of $81.3 million. The shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements
of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement, the Company filed a registration


statement
covering the shares on September 22, 2005. The registration statement was deemed effective on November 14, 2005.

On
July 14, 2005, the Company granted 190,000 shares of restricted stock to employees, without consideration. At the date of the grant, the recipient had all rights of a
stockholder including the right to vote and receive dividends subject to restrictions on transfers and forfeiture provisions. The forfeiture and transfer restriction on the shares lapse over a three
to four year period beginning on the date of grant. The Company recorded deferred stock compensation in stockholders' equity equal to the market value of the restricted shares on the date of grant and
amortizes deferred stock compensation
to expense over the vesting period. For the year ending December 31, 2005, $601 of amortization expense of this deferred stock compensation is included in general and administrative expense.

The
Company's charter provides that it can issue up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, 4,100,000 CCSs, $.01 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. As of December 31, 2005, 51,765,795 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding, 3,888,843 shares of CCSs were issued and outstanding and no
shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

All
stockholders of the Company's common stock are entitled to receive dividends and to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. The transfer agent and registrar for
the Company's common stock is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company.

Unlike
the Company's shares of common stock, CCSs do not carry any voting rights. Upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to 14 early-stage lease-up
properties, all or a portion of the CCSs will be automatically converted into shares of the Company's common stock. Initially, each CCS will be convertible on a one-for-one
basis into shares of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. Beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2006, and ending with the quarter ending
December 31, 2008, the Company will calculate the net operating income from the 14 wholly owned early-stage lease-up properties over the 12-month period ending in such
quarter. Within 35 days following the end of each quarter referred to above, some or all of the CCSs will be converted so that the total percentage (not to exceed 100%) of CCS issued in
connection with the formation transactions that have been converted to common stock will be equal to the percentage determined by dividing the net operating income for such period in excess of
$5.1 million by $4.6 million. If any CCS remains unconverted through the calculation made in respect of the 12-month period ending December 31, 2008, such outstanding
CCSs will be cancelled and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock.

While
any CCSs remain outstanding, a majority of the Company's independent directors must review and approve the net operating income calculation for each measurement period and also
must approve any sales of any of the 14 wholly-owned early-stage lease-up properties.

Members' Equity

Members' profits, losses and distributions of the Predecessor were allocated in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement, as amended. Member unit
holders included members of management. Member interests were divided into four classes of units.


Class A
units were common units with voting rights and no par value. There were also non-voting Class A units held by certain employees. During
April 2004, the Predecessor granted 4,019,837 Class A Units, valued at $0.30 per unit, to certain employees, resulting in a compensation charge of $1,205. All A units were redeemed or
converted to common stock as of August 17, 2004 at the option of the holder.

Class B
units were preferred units with a par value of $1.00. These units were non-convertible, non-voting and earned a 9% preferred return
(non-compounding) with no current dividend paid. The 9% preferred return was paid based upon available funds, including upon liquidation or termination. All B units were redeemed or
converted to common stock as of August 17, 2004 at the option of the holder.

Class C
units were preferred units with a par value of $1.00. These units were non-convertible, non-voting and earned a 9% preferred return with current
dividends paid quarterly. All C units were redeemed or converted to common stock as of August 17, 2004 at the option of the holder.

Class E
units were preferred units with a par value of $1.00. These units were non-convertible, non-voting and earned a 7% preferred return with current
dividends paid quarterly. These units were redeemable after July 1, 2004 at the option of the holder. All E units were redeemed or converted to common stock as of August 17, 2004 at the
option of the holder.

Class B,
C and E units did not participate in the distribution of profits after payment of the preferred return.

18.   STOCK OPTION PLAN

As of December 31, 2005, the Company has authorized 8,800,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Company's stock option plans: the 2004
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, and the 2004 Non-Employee Directors' Share Plan. Under the terms of the Plans, the exercise price of an option shall be determined by the
Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee and reflected in the applicable award agreement. Each option will be exercisable after the period or periods specified in the award agreement, which
will generally not exceed 10 years from the date of grant (or five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% stockholder, if permitted under the Plans). Options
will be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms as determined by the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee, but under no circumstances may be exercised if such exercise would
cause a violation of the ownership limit in the Company's charter. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee at the time of grant, such stock options shall
vest ratably over a four-year period beginning on the date of grant.

22.   DECONSOLIDATION OF ASSETS

As a result of the distribution of the Predecessor's equity ownership in Extra Space Development ("ESD") and the release of all puts and guarantees on
August 16, 2004, the Predecessor deconsolidated certain properties during the year ended December 31, 2004. The operating results through August 16, 2004 relating to the
properties that were deconsolidated are included in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the deconsolidation, the following assets and liabilities were removed from the
Predecessor's accounts:

The
Company previously consolidated a property in Pico Rivera, California in which neither the Company nor the Predecessor has any equity or profits interest. The property was owned by
the Predecessor, and sold at cost to certain former members of the Predecessor. However, the Company and the Predecessor continued to guarantee the mortgage loan on the property, and therefore,
consolidated the property's operations until the loan guarantee was satisfied or released. In December 2004, this loan guarantee was released and the property was deconsolidated. As a result of
the deconsolidation, the following assets and liabilities were removed from the Predecessor's accounts:

23.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has an operating lease on its corporate offices and owns nine self-storage facilities that are subject to ground leases. At
December 31, 2005, future minimum rental payments under these non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:


$

4,465


4,505


4,327


4,207


4,129

Thereafter

23,872

$

45,505

The
monthly rental amount for one of the ground leases is the greater of a minimum amount or a percentage of gross monthly receipts. The Company recorded rent expense of $2,591, $1,332
and $277 related to these leases in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
Company has guaranteed three construction loans for unconsolidated partnerships that own development properties in Baltimore, Maryland, Chicago, Illinois and Peoria, Arizona. These
properties are owned by joint ventures in which the Company has 10% equity interests. These guarantees were entered into in November 2004, July 2005 and August 2005, respectively.
At December 31, 2005, the total amount of guaranteed mortgage debt relating to these joint ventures was $12,073 (unaudited). These mortgage loans mature December 1, 2007, July 28,
2008 and August 31, 2008, respectively. If the joint ventures default on the loans, the Company may be forced to repay the loans. Repossessing and/or selling the self-storage
facilities and land that collateralize the loans could provide funds sufficient to reimburse the Company. The estimated fair market value of the encumbered assets at December 31, 2005 is
$17,665 (unaudited). The Company has recorded no liability in relation to this guarantee as of December 31, 2005. The fair value of the guarantee is not material. To date, the joint ventures
have not defaulted on their mortgage debt. The Company believes the risk of having to perform on the guarantee is remote.

The
Company has been involved in routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2005, the Company is not presently involved in any material
litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against the Predecessor or its properties.

24.   RISK MANAGEMENT AND USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the normal course of its on-going business operations, the Company encounters economic risk. There are three main components of economic risk:
interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its interest-bearing liabilities. Credit risk is the risk of inability or unwillingness of tenants to
make contractually required payments. Market risk is the risk of declines in the value of properties due to changes in rental rates, interest rates or other market factors affecting the value of
properties held by the Company. As previously disclosed in Note 9, the Company has entered into a Swap Agreement to mange its risk.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

As previously reported in our report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 22, 2005, on
April 18, 2005, we dismissed our auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and appointed Ernst & Young LLP as our new independent auditors, effective April 19, 2005.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

(i)    Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Exchange Act are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of
"disclosure controls and procedures" in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no mater how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a
reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

We
have formed a disclosure committee that is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure obligations of the Company on a timely basis. The
disclosure committee reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

(ii)   Internal Control over Financial Reporting

(a)   Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based
on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2005. We excluded from our assessment the
internal controls over financial reporting relating to the acquisition of Storage USA ("SUSA"), which was acquired on July 14, 2005. SUSA accounted for 31.5% of our consolidated total assets as
of December 31, 2005 and 18.3% of our consolidated total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the


risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our
management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

(b)   Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Extra Space Storage, Inc.

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Extra Space Storage, Inc. (the
"Company") maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As
indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Storage USA, which is included in the December 31, 2005 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 31.5% of
total assets as of December 31, 2005 and 18.3% of total revenue for the year then ended. Management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at this entity
as Storage USA


was
acquired on July 14, 2005. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of
Storage USA.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based
on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005,
and the related consolidated statement of operations, redeemable units and members' and stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005 of Extra Space
Storage, Inc. and our report dated March 9, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(c)   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a- 15(f)) that occurred during our
most recent quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In
July 2005, we acquired SUSA, and as a result of this acquisition, we have undertaken a review of SUSA's internal controls and intend to make changes, if necessary, that we
belive to be appropriate to those controls as we integrate the business with ours. As we further integrate SUSA's business, we will continue to review their internal controls and make further steps to
ensure that their internal controls are effective and integrated appropriately.
