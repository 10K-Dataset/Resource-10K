You should carefully consider these risks before you make an investment decision with respect to our securities.

We disclaim any duty or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect new information, future events or otherwise.


PART I

Item 1.     Business

General

Extra Space Storage Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed as a Maryland corporation on April 30, 2004, to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties (“stores”). We closed our initial public offering (“IPO”) on August 17, 2004. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “EXR.”

We were formed to continue the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries, which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. These companies were reorganized after the consummation of our IPO and various formation transactions. As of

December 31, 2016

, we held ownership interests in

1,016

operating stores. Of these operating stores,


are wholly-owned and


are owned in joint venture partnerships. An additional


operating stores are owned by third parties and operated by us in exchange for a management fee, bringing the total number of operating stores which we own and/or manage to

1,427

. These operating stores are located in


states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico and contain approximately

107 million

square feet of net rentable space in approximately

960,000

units and currently serve a customer base of approximately

850,000

tenants.

We operate in

three

distinct segments: (1) rental operations; (2) tenant reinsurance; and (3) property management, acquisition and development. Our rental operations activities include rental operations of stores in which we have an ownership interest. Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in our stores. Our property management, acquisition and development activities include managing, acquiring, developing and selling stores.

Substantially all of our business is conducted through Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating Partnership”). Our primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). To the extent we continue to qualify as a REIT we will not be subject to tax, with certain exceptions, on our net taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders.

We file our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You may obtain copies of these documents by visiting the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 or by accessing the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are furnished to the SEC, we make copies of these documents available to the public free of charge through our website at www.extraspace.com, or by contacting our Secretary at our principal offices, which are located at 2795 East Cottonwood Parkway, Suite 300, Salt Lake City, Utah 84121, telephone number (801) 365-4600.

Management

Members of our executive management team have significant experience in all aspects of the self-storage industry, having acquired and/or developed a significant number of stores since before our IPO.  Our executive management team and their years of industry experience are as follows: Joseph D. Margolis, Chief Executive Officer, 12 years; Scott Stubbs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 16 years; Samrat Sondhi, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, 13 years; Gwyn McNeal, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, 11 years; James Overturf, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, 18 years; and Kenneth M. Woolley, Executive Chairman, 36 years.  Spencer F. Kirk served as our Chief Executive Officer through December 31, 2016 and continues to serve on the Company's board of directors.  Joseph D. Margolis succeeded Mr. Kirk as the Company's Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2017.

Our executive management team and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the Company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 4,665,566 shares or 3.7% of our outstanding common stock as of

February 21, 2017

.


Industry & Competition

Stores offer month-to-month storage space rental for personal or business use and are a cost-effective and flexible storage alternative. Tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited, exclusive access. Tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units. Self-storage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet, with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet. Stores generally have on-site managers who supervise and run the day-to-day operations, providing tenants with assistance as needed.

Self-storage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes, or simply because of a need for storage space. The mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a store’s local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence. Items that residential tenants place in self-storage range from cars, boats and recreational vehicles, to furniture, household items and appliances. Commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods, records, inventory or storage for seasonal goods.

Our research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business, making high-density, high-traffic population centers ideal locations for stores. A store’s perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a site’s ability to successfully secure rentals. Although most stores are leased to tenants on a month-to-month basis, tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time.

The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March.

Since inception in the early 1970’s, the self-storage industry has experienced significant growth. The self-storage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years. According to the Self-Storage Almanac (the “Almanac”), in 2008, the national average physical occupancy rate was 80.3% of net rentable square feet, compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 91.2% in 2016.

Recently we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire stores, especially for brokered portfolios. Competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities, and this will likely continue.

The industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership. According to the Almanac, the top ten self-storage companies in the United States operated approximately 19.4% of the total U.S. stores, and the top 50 self-storage companies operated approximately 28.6% of the total U.S. stores as of

December 31, 2016

. We believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future. We also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions.

We are the second largest self-storage operator in the United States. We are one of five public self-storage REITs along with CubeSmart, National Storage Affiliates, Life Storage and Public Storage.

Long-Term Growth and Investment Strategies

Our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow available for distribution to our stockholders and to achieve sustainable long-term growth in cash flow per share in order to maximize long-term stockholder value. We continue to evaluate a range of growth initiatives and opportunities, including the following:

•

Maximize the performance of our stores through strategic, efficient and proactive management.

We pursue revenue-generating and expense-minimizing opportunities in our operations. Our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology system’s ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management. Our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs, which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.

•

Acquire self storage stores.

Our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multi-store portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value. We have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. In addition, we believe our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals. We continue to review available acquisitions. As interest rates increase, our expectation is that capitalization rates will also increase and that prices will begin to decrease.  We remain


a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value.

•

Expand our management business.

Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint. We believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. We pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores.

Financing of Our Long-Term Growth Strategies

Acquisition and Development Financing

The following table presents information on our revolving lines of credit (the “Credit Lines”) for the periods indicated. All of our Credit Lines are guaranteed by us (amounts in thousands).

We expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new store acquisitions. We plan to finance future acquisitions through a combination of cash, borrowings under the Credit Lines, traditional secured and unsecured mortgage financing, joint ventures and additional debt or equity offerings.

Joint Venture Financing

As of

December 31, 2016

, we own


of our stores through joint ventures with third parties.  We generally manage the day-to-day operations of the underlying stores owned in these joint ventures and have the right to participate in major decisions relating to sales of stores or financings by the applicable joint venture. Our joint venture partners typically provide most of the equity capital required for the operation of the respective business. Under the operating agreements for the joint ventures, we maintain the right to receive between 4.0% and 80.0% of the available cash flow from operations after our joint venture partners and the Company have received a predetermined return, and between 4.0% and 75.0% of the available cash flow from capital transactions after our joint venture partners and the Company have received a return of their capital plus such predetermined return. Most joint venture agreements include buy-sell rights, as well as rights of first offer in connection with the sale of stores by the joint venture.

Disposition of Stores

We will continue to review our portfolio for stores or groups of stores that are underperforming or are not strategically located, and determine whether to dispose of these stores to fund other growth. As of

December 31, 2016

, we had

two

parcels of land that were categorized as held for sale.

Regulation

Generally, stores are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to lien sale rights and procedures. Changes in any of these laws or regulations, as well as changes in laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act, which increase the potential liability for environmental conditions or circumstances existing or created by tenants or others on stores, or laws affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of stores or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws also exist that may require modifications to the stores, or restrict further renovations thereof, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, thereby requiring substantial capital expenditures. To the extent our stores are not in compliance, we are likely to incur additional costs to comply with the ADA.

Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.

Store management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.

Changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of

February 21, 2017

, we had

3,287

employees and believe our relationship with our employees is good. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement.

Item 1A.     Risk Factors

An investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report before trading in our securities. If any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition could be harmed.

Our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments. We are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our stores. There are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate, including the following:

Risks Related to Our Stores and Operations

Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results.

Our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our stores. Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts. If our stores fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements, including operating and other expenses, debt service and capital expenditures, our net income, funds from operations (“FFO”), cash flow, financial condition, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the operating performance of our stores:

•

the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate, which may be adversely impacted by, among other factors, industry slowdowns, relocation of businesses and changing demographics;

•

periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates, or declining demand for self-storage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults;

•

a decline of the current economic environment;

•

local or regional real estate market conditions, such as competing stores, the oversupply of self-storage or a reduction in demand for self-storage in a particular area;

•

perceptions by prospective users of our stores of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our stores and the neighborhoods in which they are located;


•

increased operating costs, including the need for capital improvements, insurance premiums, real estate taxes and utilities;

•

the impact of environmental protection laws;

•

changes in tax, real estate and zoning laws; and

•

earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, terrorist acts, civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses.

If we are unable to promptly re-let our units or if the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than expected, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Virtually all of our leases are on a month-to-month basis. Any delay in re-letting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, lower than expected rental rates upon re-letting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth.

We depend upon our on-site personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our stores, and any difficulties we encounter in hiring, training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance.

We had

2,723

field personnel as of

February 21, 2017

in the management and operation of our stores. The general professionalism of our store managers and staff are contributing factors to a store’s ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants. We also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure stores. If we are unable to successfully recruit, train and retain qualified field personnel, the quality of service we strive to provide at our stores could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance.

Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow.

We maintain comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders), extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores. Certain types of losses, however, may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war or terrorism. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store. In addition, if any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.

Increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income.

Costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us. Increases in income, property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income, FFO, cash flow, financial condition, ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders, and the trading price of our securities. Similarly, changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on stores or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may affect our results of operations.

Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property. Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such substances or materials. The presence of such substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to lease, sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real stores for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials.

Certain environmental laws also impose liability, without regard to knowledge or fault, for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no


longer own or operate the property. Moreover, the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases, as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases.

Certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances. For example, environmental laws govern the management of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions.

No assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our stores reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of our stores did not create any material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our stores. There also exists the risk that material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future. Finally, future laws, ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability.

Costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses.

Under the ADA, places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores, or restrict certain further renovations of the stores, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our stores to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ADA or other legislation, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or other legislation, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.

Our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation, which may adversely affect our results.

Our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation. The regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, to promulgate, interpret and implement regulations, and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers. As a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction, we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities, or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We face competition for the acquisition of stores and other assets, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions.

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of stores and other assets, including national, regional and local operators and developers of stores. These competitors may drive up the price we pay for stores or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those stores or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment in stores may increase. This competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them. Because of an increased interest in single-store acquisitions among tax-motivated individual purchasers, we may pay higher prices if we purchase single stores in comparison with portfolio acquisitions. If we pay higher prices for stores or other assets, our profitability will be reduced.

We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth.

Our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. We may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions


or investments on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price.

Our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks:

•

competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital, including other publicly-traded REITs and institutional investment funds;

•

competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability;

•

the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions;

•

failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all;

•

we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired stores; and

•

we may acquire stores subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the stores and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the stores.

In addition, strategic decisions by us, such as acquisitions, may adversely affect the price of our securities.

We may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired stores.

We have acquired many stores in the past, and we expect to continue acquiring stores in the future. If we acquire any stores, we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio. The acquired stores may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated, may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert management’s attention away from day-to-day operations, which could impair our operating results as a whole.

Our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns, which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions.

To the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities, we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects:

•

we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all;

•

we may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;

•

we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations; and

•

occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped stores may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investment not being profitable.

In deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the store. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed store as quickly as expected or at all. Any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results, liquidity and financial condition, which could result in a decline in the value of our securities.

We may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects. If our reputation in the self-storage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced, our ability to develop or redevelop stores could be affected, which would limit our growth.

We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.

We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personally


identifiable information, and tenant and lease data. We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. While, to date, we have not experienced a security breach, this risk has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure

Our business could be harmed if key personnel with long-standing business relationships in the self-storage industry terminate their employment with us.

Our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team, who have substantial experience in the self-storage industry. In addition, our ability to acquire or develop stores in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners, such as affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. There is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers. The loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects.

We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different risks.

We may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this document. A change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations.

If other self-storage companies convert to an UPREIT structure or if tax laws change, we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions.

Because we are structured as an UPREIT, we are a more attractive acquirer of stores to tax-motivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as UPREITs. However, if other self-storage companies restructure their holdings to become UPREITs, this competitive advantage will disappear. In addition, new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), or the U.S. Treasury Department that could affect the attractiveness of our UPREIT structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions.

Tax indemnification obligations may require the Operating Partnership to maintain certain debt levels.

We have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the Operating Partnership upon acquisition by the Company, including making available the opportunity to (1) guarantee debt or (2) enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation. We have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions. These obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business.

Our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we held interests in


operating stores through joint ventures. Some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers financial conditions and disputes between us and our co-venturers. We expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores. In such event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. The decision-making authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners, is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners. In addition,


investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers, which could harm our financial condition.

Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our Operating Partnership.

Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, and our Operating Partnership or any partner thereof. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, have fiduciary duties, as a general partner, to our Operating Partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Our duties, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, as a general partner to our Operating Partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our Company. The partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our Company or the limited partners in our Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness, and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest.

Additionally, the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we, our direct wholly-owned Massachusetts business trust subsidiary, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, nor any of our or their trustees, directors or officers, will be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we, or such trustee, director or officer, acted in good faith. In addition, our Operating Partnership is required to indemnify us, our affiliates and each of our respective trustees, officers, directors, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership, provided that our Operating Partnership will not indemnify for (1) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (2) any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful.

The provisions of Delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement.

Certain provisions of Maryland law and our organizational documents, including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter, may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction.

Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common stock or 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding capital stock. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit. However, our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT. These restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT. The ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Different ownership limits apply to the family of Kenneth M. Woolley, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing; to Spencer F. Kirk, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing; and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter.


Our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders.

Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval. In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.

Maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. Our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers.

To the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock.

Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a U.S. stockholder under current U.S. federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in his, her, or its common stock, but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis. If distributions result in a reduction of a stockholder’s adjusted basis in such holder’s common stock, subsequent sales of such holder’s common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis.

Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry

Our primary business involves the ownership and operation of self-storage stores.

Our current strategy is to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop only self-storage stores. Consequently, we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry. Because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid, this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change. Decreases in market rents, negative tax, real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs, lower the value of our investments and decrease our income, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our stores.

Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more stores in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any store for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a store.

We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a store can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a store, we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that store for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that store. These transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a store even if we deem it necessary or appropriate.


Any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield income-producing returns, if at all, and may result in additional costs to us to comply with re-zoning restrictions or environmental regulations.

We have invested in the past, and may invest in the future, in unimproved real property. Unimproved properties generally take longer to yield income-producing returns based on the typical time required for development. Any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with re-zoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups. Any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an income-producing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results.

Any negative perceptions of the self-storage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price.

To the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the self-storage industry, the value of our securities may be negatively impacted, which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets.

Risks Related to Our Debt Financings

Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us.

Uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects. A downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.

Required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had approximately

$4.4 billion

of outstanding indebtedness. We may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development. We may borrow under our Credit Lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores. Additionally, we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and, therefore, we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity and/or debt offerings. Further, we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a REIT or to make our expected distributions.

If we are required to utilize our Credit Lines for purposes other than acquisition activity, this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth. Therefore, our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:

•

our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;

•

we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT;

•

we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;

•

because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense;

•

we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our stores, possibly on disadvantageous terms;

•

after debt service, the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced;

•

our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt;

•

we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns, reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;

•

we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our stores that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases;

•

we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees;


•

we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and

•

our default under any one of our mortgage loans with cross-default or cross-collateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other stores.

Increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had approximately

$4.4 billion

of debt outstanding, of which approximately

$1.3 billion

, or

30.0%

was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). This variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately

2.3%

per annum. Increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions. For example, if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately

$13.1 million

annually.

Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.

In certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements. Hedging involves risks, such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders.

Risks Related to Qualification and Operation as a REIT

To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions.

To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains, and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. While historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a REIT is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis, or possibly long-term, to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments.

Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.

The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual U.S. stockholders is 20%. Dividends paid by REITs, however, are generally not eligible for the reduced rates. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our securities.

In addition, the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends, which could negatively affect the value of our stores.

Possible legislative or other actions affecting REITs could adversely affect our stockholders.

The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed.


The power of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.

Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders.

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.

We believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT or lose our qualification as a REIT at any time, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because:

•

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;

•

we also could be subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and

•

unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified.

In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that our U.S. individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates, and our U.S. corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject, in each case, to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code in order to maintain our REIT status, we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of $50,000 or more for each such failure. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our securities.

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code is greater in the case of a REIT that, like us, holds its assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets, the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income including capital gains. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. Although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our qualification as a REIT.

We will pay some taxes.

Even though we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. Extra Space Management, Inc. manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties. We, jointly with Extra Space Management, Inc., elected to treat Extra Space Management, Inc. as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) of our Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation, and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us. ESM Reinsurance Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Extra Space Management, Inc., generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax. In addition, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants, our taxable REIT subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the


ordinary course of business. Also, if we sell property as a dealer (i.e., to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business), we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales. While we do not intend to sell stores as a dealer, the IRS could take a contrary position. To the extent that we are, or our taxable REIT subsidiary is, required to pay U.S. federal, state or local taxes, we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders.

Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.

To qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits.

None.

Item 2.     Properties

As of

December 31, 2016

, we owned or had ownership interests in

1,016

operating stores. Of these stores,


are wholly-owned and


are held in joint ventures. In addition, we managed an additional


stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which we own and/or manage to

1,427

. These stores are located in


states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. We receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 6.0% of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party sites. As of

December 31, 2016

, we owned and/or managed approximately

107 million

square feet of rentable space configured in approximately

960,000

separate storage units. Approximately 70% of our stores are clustered around large population centers, such as Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco/Oakland. These markets contain above-average population and income demographics for stores. The clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. Our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence.

We consider a store to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80% occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1 of the current year, or has been open for three years prior to the January 1 of the current year.

As of

December 31, 2016

, approximately

850,000

tenants were leasing storage units at the

1,427

operating stores that we own and/or manage, primarily on a month-to-month basis, providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Existing tenants generally receive rate increases at least annually, for which no direct correlation has been drawn to our vacancy trends. Although leases are short-term in duration, the typical tenant tends to remain at our stores for an extended period of time. For stores that were stabilized as of

December 31, 2016

, the average length of stay was approximately

14.3

months.

The average annual rent per square foot for our existing customers at stabilized stores, net of discounts and bad debt, was

$15.88

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to

$14.92

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

. Average annual rent per square foot for new leases was

$17.02

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to

$15.91

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

. The average discounts, as a percentage of rental revenues, during these periods were

3.3%

and

3.2%

, respectively.

Our store portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located. Most often sites are what we consider “hybrid” facilities, a mix of both drive-up buildings and multi-floor buildings. We have a number of multi-floor buildings with elevator access only, and a number of facilities featuring ground-floor access only.

In October 2014, a store located in Venice, California was damaged by fire. In 2016, the store was re-opened for operation and is continuing to lease up.

Item 3.     Legal Proceedings

We are involved in various legal proceedings and are subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The estimated loss, if any, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. Therefore, any estimate(s) of loss disclosed below represents what management believes to be an estimate of loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria and does not represent our maximum loss exposure. We could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period, notwithstanding the fact that we are currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against us.

We currently have several legal proceedings pending against us that include causes of action alleging wrongful foreclosure, violations of various state specific self-storage statutes, and violations of various consumer fraud acts. As a result of these litigation matters, we have recorded a liability of

$5.6 million

which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Overview

We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed stores.

At

December 31, 2016

, we owned, had ownership interests in, or managed

1,427

operating stores in


states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. Of these

1,427

operating stores, we owned


, we held joint venture interests in


stores, and our taxable REIT subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc., operated an additional


stores that are owned by third parties. These operating stores contain approximately

107 million

square feet of rentable space in approximately

960,000

units and currently serve a customer base of approximately

850,000

tenants.

Our stores are generally situated in convenient, highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Petersburg/Tampa and San Francisco/Oakland. These areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels. The clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. We consider a store to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80% occupancy rate for a full year measured as of January 1 of the current year, or has been open for three years prior to the January 1 of the current year.

To maximize the performance of our stores, we employ industry-leading revenue management systems. Developed by our management team, these systems enable us to analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions. We believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues.

We derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our wholly-owned stores, from management fees on the stores we manage for joint-venture partners and unaffiliated third parties, and from our tenant reinsurance program. Our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6.0% of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores. We also receive an asset management fee of 0.5% of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures.

We operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose. Competition has impacted, and will continue to impact, our store results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. Our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage units, to actively manage unit rental rates, and on the ability of our


tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industry-leading technology systems.

We continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value. Our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following:

•

Maximize the performance of our stores through strategic, efficient and proactive management.

We pursue revenue-generating and expense-minimizing opportunities in our operations. Our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology system’s ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management. Our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs, which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.

•

Acquire self-storage stores.

Our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multi-store portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value. We have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. In addition, we believe our status as an UPREIT enables flexibility when structuring deals. We continue to review available acquisitions. As interest rates increase, our expectation is that capitalization rates will also increase and that prices will begin to decrease.  We remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value.

•

Expand our management business.

Our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint. We believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. In addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. We pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. A summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in

the notes to our consolidated financial statements (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies:

CONSOLIDATION:

Arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”). An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

A VIE is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity’s equity holders as a group either: (a) lack the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an entity is deemed to be a VIE, the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest, or combination of variable interests, that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.

We have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (i) or (ii)(b) or (ii)(c) of the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, we have performed a qualitative analysis, including considering which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each VIE and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with our financial statements. As of

December 31, 2016

, we had no consolidated VIEs. Additionally, our Operating Partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are VIEs under condition (ii)(a) above. Since the Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts, these VIEs are not consolidated.


REAL ESTATE ASSETS:

Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are generally between 5 and 39 years.

In connection with our acquisition of operating stores, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, is determined as if vacant. Intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases. We measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers, which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities. Debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

Stores purchased at the time of certificate of occupancy issuance are considered asset acquisitions.  As such, the purchase price is allocated to the land and buildings acquired based on their fair values.  Any debt assumed as part of the acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates.  Acquisition-related transactions costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price.

Intangible lease rights include: (1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on

three

stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases; and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on

eight

stores where the ground leases were assumed by us at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases. The value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the lease terms.

EVALUATION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT:

Long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. We review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. We focus on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. For these stores, we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. In addition, we review stores in the lease-up stage and compare actual operating results to original projections.

When we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred, we compare the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets.

When real estate assets are identified as held for sale, we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets, net of selling costs. If the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, we would recognize a loss on the disposal group classified as held for sale. The operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented.

INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED REAL ESTATE VENTURES:

Our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control, and joint ventures which are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Under the equity method, our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows, we follow the “look through” approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture’s sale of assets) in which case it is reported as an investing activity.


Our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. An investment is impaired if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment, using significant unobservable inputs, is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:

The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income, outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.

REVENUE AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION:

Rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally on month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period. Late charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned. Management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements. Equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. Interest income is recognized as earned.

Property expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. We accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts, estimates and historical trends. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected.

Tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage. We record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history. The unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end, including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported. We use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received. The administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported. Annually, a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid claims liability. Prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known. The impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations. The unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value. Each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program. Tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee. Our exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant. We purchase reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount on any one event. We do not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements.

INCOME TAXES:

We have elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, among other things, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders. We plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If we were to fail to meet these requirements, we would be subject to federal income tax. We are subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

We have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries, Extra Space Management, Inc., as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). In general, our TRS may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred.

December 31, 2016

included the operations of

1,016

stores (


wholly-owned,

one

in a consolidated joint venture, and


in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, which included the operations of


stores (


wholly-owned,

one

in a consolidated joint venture, and


in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method).

Revenues

The following table presents information on revenues earned for the years indicated:

Property Rental—

The increase in property rental revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2016

was primarily the result of an increase of

$144,985

associated with acquisitions completed in


and


.  We acquired


stores during the year ended

December 31, 2016

and 171 stores during the year ended December 31,


.  Property rental revenue also increased by

$42,171

during the year ended

December 31, 2016

as a result of increases in rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores.  Revenues at our lease-up stores increased by

$3,439

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

due primarily to increases in occupancy. The achieved rental rate to new tenants on wholly owned properties for the year ended

December 31, 2016

increased an average of approximately

7.0%

over the prior year.  These increases were offset by decreases in property revenue of

$1,991

for the year ended December 31,


related to the sales of stores during


.

Tenant Reinsurance

—The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was due primarily to the increase in stores operated. We operated

1,427

stores at

December 31, 2016

, compared to

1,347

stores at

December 31, 2015

.

Management Fees and Other Income

—Our TRS manages stores owned by our joint ventures and third parties. Management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash collected from stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. We also earn an asset management fee from the Storage Portfolio I (“SPI”) joint venture, equal to 0.50% multiplied by the total asset value, provided certain conditions are met. The increase in management fees is due primarily to an increase in the revenues at the stores we managed.   At

December 31, 2016

, we managed


stores for third parties and non-consolidated joint ventures, compared to


stores at

December 31, 2015

.  The decrease in the number of stores managed is due primarily to our acquisition of 40 stores from our joint ventures during 2016.


Expenses

The following table presents information on expenses for the years indicated:

Property Operations

—The increase in property operations expense consists primarily of an increase of

$45,055

related to acquisitions completed in


and


. We acquired


operating stores during the year ended

December 31, 2016

and 171 stores during the year ended

December 31, 2015

.

Tenant Reinsurance

—Tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. The change is due primarily to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed. At

December 31, 2016

, we owned and/or managed

1,427

stores compared to

1,347

stores at

December 31, 2015

.

Acquisition Related Costs and Other—

These costs relate primarily to acquisition activities during the periods indicated. The decrease in these expenses for the year ended

December 31, 2016

compared to the prior year was due to a decrease in the number of acquisitions.  We acquired


properties during the year ended

December 31, 2016

compared to


during the prior year.  Included in the acquisitions completed in 2015 was the acquisition of SmartStop Self Storage Inc. ("SmartStop") on October 1, 2015.  As part of this acquisition, we recorded an expense of $38,360 related to defeasance costs and prepayment penalties incurred related to the repayment of SmartStop's existing debt as of the acquisition date.  We incurred $8,053 of professional fess/closing costs, $6,338 of severance-related costs, $1,327 of other payroll-related costs and $9,043 of other acquisition related costs as a result of the acquisition of SmartStop, for a total of $63,121.

General and Administrative—

General and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores, including corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. These expenses are recognized as incurred. General and administrative expenses for the year ended

December 31, 2016

increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the overall cost associated with the management of additional stores. At

December 31, 2016

, we owned and/or managed

1,427

stores compared to

1,347

stores at

December 31, 2015

.  Additionally, during


, we accrued a

$4,000

expense related to the potential settlement of a legal action. We did not observe any material trends in specific payroll, travel or other expenses that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores.

Depreciation and Amortization

—Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. We acquired


operating stores during the year ended

December 31, 2016

, and


operating stores during the year ended

December 31, 2015

.


Other Income and Expenses

The following table presents information on other revenues and expenses for the years indicated:

Gain on Real Estate Transactions, Earnout from Prior Acquisition and Sale of Other Assets—

During the year ended December 31, 2016, through various transactions, we sold a total of

nine

stores located in Indiana, Ohio and Texas.  We received a total of

$22,002

in cash and

85,452

of our OP Units valued at

$7,689

in exchange for these stores.  The Operating Partnership has canceled the OP Units received.  We recognized a total gain of

$11,358

related to these dispositions.

During 2014, we acquired a portfolio of five stores. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net operating income for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2016. At the acquisition date, we recorded an estimated liability related to this provision. As the operating income of these stores during the earnout period was higher than originally estimated, an additional payment was due to the sellers of $4,284, which was recorded as a loss during


.

In 2011, we acquired a single store in Florida. As part of the acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired store exceeded a specified amount of net rental income for the period of 12 consecutive months ending June 30, 2015. During 2014, we recorded a liability of $2,500 as an estimate of the payment that would become due. The $400 gain recorded during


represents the adjustment needed to true up the existing liability to the amount owed to the sellers as of June 30, 2015.

During


, we determined that one of our acquisitions was purchased at below its market value, and therefore recorded a $1,101 gain at the time of the acquisition, which represents the excess of the fair value of the store acquired over the consideration paid.

Interest Expense—

The increase in interest expense during the year ended

December 31, 2016

was primarily the result of higher debt balances when compared to the prior year. The total face value of our debt, including our lines of credit, was

$4,363,697

at

December 31, 2016

compared to

$3,598,254

at

December 31, 2015

.

Non-cash Interest Expense Related to Amortization of Discount on Equity Component of Exchangeable Senior Notes—

Represents the amortization of the discounts related to the equity components of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership has issued and outstanding 2.375% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2033 (the "2013 Notes") and 3.125% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2035 (the "2015 Notes.")  The 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes both have an effective interest rate of 4.0% relative to the carrying amount of the liability. The increase for the year ended

December 31, 2016

when compared to the same period in the prior year is due to the issuance of $575,000 principal amount of the 2015 Notes in September 2015 and related discount of $22,597.


Interest Income—

Interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and interest earned on notes receivable. The increase for the year ended

December 31, 2016

is related primarily to the increase in the average notes receivable balances outstanding when compared to the prior year.  The majority of the increase in interest income related to the $84,331 of notes receivable issued in conjunction with the acquisition of SmartStop in October 2015.  These notes have a 7.0% interest rate which increases to 9.0% in February 2017.  As of

December 31, 2016

, the remaining principal balance was

$52,201

.

Interest Income on Note Receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership Unit Holder

—Represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the holder of the Operating Partnership’s Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Units (the “Series A Units”).

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures—

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase for the year ended

December 31, 2016

compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily the result of an increase in our ownership interest from 2.0% to approximately 4.0% in the ESS PRISA LLC ("PRISA") joint venture and from 2.0% to approximately 4.4% in the ESS PRISA II LLC ("PRISA II") joint venture, as well as an increase in revenue at the stores owned by our joint ventures.  These increases were offset by an overall decrease in the number of stores owned by our joint ventures, primarily due to our acquisition of 40 of these stores as noted below.

On April 25, 2016, we and affiliates of Prudential Financial, Inc. ("Prudential") entered into the “Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of ESS PRISA LLC” and the “First Amendment to Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of ESS PRISA II LLC” (the “Amendments”).  The Amendments are deemed effective as of April 1, 2016.  Under the Amendments, we gave up any future rights to receive distributions from these joint ventures at the higher “excess profit participation” percentage of

17.0%

in exchange for a higher equity ownership percentage.  Our equity ownership in ESS PRISA LLC increased from

2.0%

to

4.0%

, and our equity ownership in ESS PRISA II LLC increased from

2.0%

to

4.4%

.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures—Gain on Sale of Real Estate Assets and Purchase of Joint Venture Partners’ Interests—

On November 17, 2016, we acquired


stores from our ESS WCOT LLC joint venture ("WCOT") in a step acquisition.  We owned

5.0%

of WCOT, with the other

95.0%

owned by affiliates of Prudential.  WCOT created a new subsidiary, Extra Space Storage 132 LLC ("ESS 132"), and transferred


stores into ESS 132.  WCOT then distributed ESS 132 to Prudential and us on a pro rata basis.  This distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of

$68,814

.  Immediately after the distribution, we acquired Prudential's

95.0%

interest in ESS 132 for

$153,304

, resulting in

100%

ownership of ESS 132 and the related


stores.  Based on the purchase price of Prudential's share of ESS 132, we determined that the fair value of our investment in ESS 132 immediately prior to the acquisition of Prudential's share was

$8,119

, and we recorded a gain of

$4,651

as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in ESS 132.

On September 16, 2016, we acquired


stores from PRISA II in a step acquisition.  We owned

4.4%

of PRISA II, with the other

95.6%

owned by affiliates of Prudential.  PRISA II created a new subsidiary, Extra Space Properties 131 LLC ("ESP 131"), and transferred


stores into ESP 131.  PRISA II then distributed ESP 131 to Prudential and us on a pro rata basis.  This distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of

$4,326

.  Immediately after the distribution, we acquired Prudential's

95.6%

interest in ESP 131 for

$238,679

, resulting in

100%

ownership of ESP 131 and the related


stores.  Based on the purchase price of Prudential's share of ESP 131, we determined that the fair value of our investment in ESP 131 immediately prior to the acquisition of Prudential's share was

$10,988

, and we recorded a gain of

$6,778

as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in ESP 131.  Subsequent to these transactions, PRISA II owned


stores.  We then sold our remaining interest in PRISA II to Prudential for

$34,758

in cash.  As a result of this sale, we recognized a gain of

$30,846

.

On February 2, 2016, we acquired six stores from our VRS Self Storage LLC joint venture (“VRS”) in a step acquisition. We owned 45.0% of VRS, with the other 55.0% owned by Prudential. VRS created a new subsidiary, Extra Space Properties 122 LLC (“ESP 122”) and transferred six stores into ESP 122. VRS then distributed ESP 122 to Prudential and us on a pro rata basis. This distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of $17,261, Immediately after the distribution, we acquired Prudential’s 55.0% interest in ESP 122 for $53,940, resulting in 100% ownership of ESP 122 and the related six stores. Based on the purchase price of Prudential’s share of ESP 122, we determined that the fair value of our investment in ESP 122 immediately prior to the acquisition of Prudential’s share was $44,184, and we recorded a gain of $26,923 as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in ESP 122.

In March 2015, one of our joint ventures sold a store located in New York to a third party and recognized a gain of $60,495. We recognized our 2.0% share of this gain, or $1,228.


In March 2015 we acquired a joint venture partner’s 82.4% equity interest in an existing joint venture which had one store. We previously held the remaining 17.6% equity interest in this joint venture. Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our equity interest in this joint venture as an equity-method investment. We recognized a non-cash gain of $1,629 as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in this joint venture held before the acquisition.

Income Tax Expense

—Income tax expense is the result of income earned by our TRS which includes income from our management company and reinsurance activities.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014

Overview

Results for the year ended December 31, 2015, included the operations of 999 stores (747 of which were consolidated and 252 of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included the operations of 828 stores (576 of which were consolidated and 252 of which were in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method).

Revenues

The following table presents information on revenues earned for the years indicated:


Property Rental

—The change in property rental revenues consists primarily of an increase of $69,622 associated with acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2014. We acquired 171 operating stores during 2015 and 51 stores during 2014. In addition, revenues increased by $47,560 as a result of increases in occupancy and rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores. We saw no significant increase in overall customer renewal rates and our average length of stay was approximately 13.7 months. For existing customers we generally seek to increase rental rates approximately 7% to 10% at least annually. Rental rates to new tenants increased by approximately 8.9% over the prior year. Occupancy at our stabilized stores increased to 91.1% at December 31, 2015, as compared to 89.6% at December 31, 2014.

Tenant Reinsurance

—The increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was partially due to the increase in overall customer participation to approximately 72.8% at December 31, 2015, compared to approximately 70.7% at December 31, 2014. In addition, we operated 1,347 stores at December 31, 2015, compared to 1,088 stores at December 31, 2014.

Management Fees and Other Income

—Our TRS manages stores owned by our joint ventures and third parties. Management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash collected from stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. We also earn an asset management fee from the Storage Portfolio I (“SPI”) joint venture, equal to 0.50% multiplied by the total asset value, provided certain conditions are met. The increase in management fees is due to an increase in the number of properties managed. At December 31, 2015, we managed 348 stores, compared to 260 stores at December 31, 2014.

Expenses

The following table presents information on expenses for the years indicated:

Property Operations

—The increase in property operations expense consists primarily of an increase of $26,236 related to acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2014. We acquired 171 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 51 stores during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Tenant Reinsurance

—Tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. The change is due primarily to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed. At December 31, 2015, we owned and/or managed 1,347 stores compared to 1,088 stores at December 31, 2014. In addition, there was an increase in overall customer participation to approximately 72.8% at December 31, 2015 from approximately 70.7% at December 31, 2014.

Acquisition Related Costs

—These costs relate to acquisition activities during the periods indicated. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year was related primarily to the acquisition of SmartStop on October 1, 2015. As part of this acquisition, we recorded an expense of $38,360 related to defeasance costs and prepayment penalties incurred related to the repayment of SmartStop’s existing debt as of the acquisition date. We incurred $8,053 of professional fees/closing costs, $6,338 of severance-related costs, $1,327 of other payroll-related costs and $9,043 of other acquisition related costs as a result of the acquisition of SmartStop, for a total of $63,121. Additionally, we acquired 49 other properties during the year ended December 31, 2015.

General and Administrative

—General and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not related to our stores, including corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. The expenses are recognized as incurred. General and administrative expense increased over the prior year primarily as a result of the costs related to the management of additional stores. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 171 stores, 161 of which we did not previously manage. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired 51 stores, 30 of which we did not previously manage. We did not observe any


material trends specific to payroll, travel or other expense that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores.

Depreciation and Amortization

—Depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. We acquired 171 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2015, and 51 operating stores during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Other Income and Expenses

The following table presents information on other revenues and expenses for the years indicated:

Gain (Loss) on Real Estate Transactions, Earnout from Prior Acquisitions and Sale of Other Assets—

During 2011, we acquired a store located in Florida. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired store exceeded a specified amount of net rental income for any twelve-month period prior to June 30, 2015. At the acquisition date, $133 was recorded as the estimated amount that would be due, and we believed that it was unlikely that any significant additional payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. Because the rental growth of the stores trended significantly higher than expected, we recorded additional liability of $2,500. This amount is included in gain (loss) on sale of real estate and earnout from prior acquisitions on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $400 gain recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 represents the adjustment needed to true up the existing liability to the amount owed to the sellers as of June 30, 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that one of our acquisitions was purchased at below its market value, and we therefore recorded a $1,101 gain, which represents the excess of the fair value of the store acquired over the consideration paid.

During 2012, we acquired a portfolio of ten stores. As part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net rental income two years after the acquisition date. At the acquisition date, we believed that it was unlikely that any significant payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. The rental growth of the stores was significantly higher than expected, resulting in a payment to the sellers of $7,785. This amount is included in gain (loss) on sale of real estate and earnout from prior acquisitions on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Property Casualty Loss, Net

—In October 2014, a store located in Venice, California, was damaged by a fire. As a result, we recorded a loss, net of insurance recoveries, of $1,724.


Interest Expense

—Interest expense increased due to the increase in total amount of debt outstanding. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate. At December 31, 2015, our total face value of debt was $3,598,254, compared to a total face value of debt of $2,379,657 at December 31, 2014. The average interest rate was 3.1% as of December 31, 2015, compared to 3.4% as of December 31, 2014.

Non-cash Interest Expense Related to Amortization of Discount on Equity Component of Exchangeable Senior Notes

—Represents the amortization of the discount related to the equity component of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our Operating Partnership. In June 2013, our Operating Partnership issued $250,000 of its 2013 Notes. In September 2015, our Operating Partnership issued $575,000 of its 2015 Notes, and repurchased $164,636 principal amount of the 2013 Notes. Both the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes have effective interest rates of 4.0%.

Interest Income

—Interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and interest earned on notes receivable. The increase relates primarily to the increase in the average balance of notes receivable when compared to the prior year and an increase in our average cash balance. As part of the SmartStop acquisition on October 1, 2015, we issued an $84,331 note receivable that accrues interest at 7.0% annually. We recorded approximately $1,476 of interest income related to this note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Interest Income on Note Receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership Unit Holder

—Represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the holder of the Series A Units.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures

—Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in equity in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to increases in revenue at the stores owned by the joint ventures.

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures—Gain on Sale of Real Estate Assets and Purchase of Joint Venture Partners’ Interests

— During March 2015, one of our joint ventures sold a store located in New York to a third party and recognized a gain of $60,495. We recognized our 2.0% share of this gain, or $1,228. Additionally, in March 2015 we acquired a joint venture partner’s 82.4% equity interest in an existing joint venture. We previously held the remaining 17.6% equity interest in this joint venture. Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our equity interest in this joint venture as an equity-method investment. We recognized a non-cash gain of $1,629 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in this joint venture held before the acquisition.

In December 2013 and May 2014, as part of a larger acquisition, we acquired our joint venture partners’ 60% to 65% equity interests in six stores located in California. We previously held the remaining 35% to 40% interests in these stores through six separate joint ventures with affiliates of Grupe Properties Co. Inc. (“Grupe”). Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our interests in these joint ventures as equity-method investments. We recognized a non-cash gain of $3,438 during the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in one of these joint ventures held before the acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an additional gain of $584 as a result of the final cash distributions received from the other five joint ventures associated with the acquisitions that were completed during 2013.

Income Tax Expense

—The increase in income tax expense relates primarily to an increase in income earned by our TRS when compared to the same periods in the prior year. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded the initial tax benefit related to a royalty fee that we charge quarterly to our captive insurance subsidiary, which reduced the tax expense for that period.


Net Income Allocated to Noncontrolling Interests

The following table presents information on net income allocated to noncontrolling interests for the years indicated:

Net Income Allocated to Preferred Operating Partnership Noncontrolling Interests

—In December 2014, as part of the acquisition of a single store, our Operating Partnership issued 548,390 Series D Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series D Units”). The Series D Units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit, and receive distributions at an annual rate of 5.0%.

In December 2013 and May 2014, as part of a portfolio acquisition, our Operating Partnership issued 704,016 Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series C Units”). The Series C Units have a liquidation value of $42.10 per unit. From issuance until the fifth anniversary of issuance, the Series C Units receive distributions at an annual rate of $0.18 plus the then-payable quarterly distribution per OP Unit.

In April 2014, as part of a single store acquisition, our Operating Partnership issued 333,360 Series B Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series B Units”). During August and September 2013, as part of a portfolio acquisition, our Operating Partnership issued 1,342,727 Series B Units. The Series B Units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit and receive distributions at an annual rate of 6.0%.

Income allocated to the Preferred Operating Partnership noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 represents the fixed distributions paid to the holders of the Series A Units, Series B Units, Series C Units and Series D Units, plus approximately 0.7% of the remaining net income allocated to the holders of the Series A Units.

Net Income Allocated to Operating Partnership and Other Noncontrolling Interests

—Income allocated to the Operating Partnership represents approximately 4.2% and 3.5% of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the Preferred Operating Partnership unit holders for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The percentage of net income allocated to the Operating Partnership noncontrolling interest increased due to OP Units issued in conjunction with acquisitions during 2015.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

FFO provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. We believe FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings. Net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe FFO more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (“NAREIT”) as net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the consolidated financial statements.  FFO should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with GAAP.

The computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions.


The following table presents the calculation of FFO for the periods indicated:

SAME-STORE RESULTS

Our same-store pool for the periods presented consists of


stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80% or more for one calendar year. We believe that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to: occupancy, rental revenue growth, operating expense growth, net operating income growth, etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole. The following table presents operating data for our same-store portfolio.


Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015

The following table presents a reconciliation of same-store net operating income to income from operations as presented on our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:

The increases in same-store rental and tenant reinsurance revenues for the three months and year ended

December 31, 2016

, as compared to the same periods ended

December 31, 2015

, were due primarily to higher rental rates for both new and existing customers. Expenses were lower for the

three months ended December 31, 2016

due to decreases year-over-year across most expense categories, primarily due to comparably higher expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2015.   The most significant decreases were in repairs and maintenance and utilities.  Decreases in these expenses were partially offset by increases in property taxes.  For the

year ended December 31, 2016

, expenses were higher due to increases in property taxes and credit card processing fees. These increases in expenses were partially offset by decreases in utilities and repairs and maintenance expense.


Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014

The following table presents a reconciliation of same-store net operating income to income from operations as presented on our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:

The increases in same-store rental and tenant reinsurance revenues for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods ended December 31, 2014, were due primarily to an increase in occupancy, an increase in rental rates to new and existing customers, and reduced customer discounts. Expenses were higher for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to increases in tenant reinsurance expense, credit card merchant fees and property taxes. Increases were offset by decreases in utility expenses and property insurance expense.

CASH FLOWS

Comparison of the Year Ended

December 31, 2016

to the Year Ended

December 31, 2015

Cash provided by operating activities was

$539,263

and

$367,329

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively. The change when compared to the prior year was primarily due to a

$187,553

increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of

$49,103

. These increases were offset by an increase in the gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase joint venture partners’ interests of

$66,342

. This gain was primarily the result of three step acquisitions of stores that were previously owned by our VRS, PRISA II and WCOT joint ventures, along with the gain on the sale of our remaining interest in the PRISA II joint venture to Prudential.


Cash used in investing activities was

$1,032,035

and

$1,625,664

, for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in total cash paid for the acquisition of real estate assets of

$464,227

. We purchased


stores during the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to 171 stores purchased during


. There was also an increase in proceeds from sale of real estate assets, investments in real estate ventures and other assets of

$60,013

, a decrease in cash paid on the purchase/issuance of notes receivable of

$57,902

and an increase in cash received from principal payments on notes receivable of

$42,785

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

when compared to


.

Cash provided by financing activities was

$460,831

and

$1,286,471

, for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively. The change related primarily to a decrease in proceeds from notes payable and revolving lines of credit of

$221,445

, a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of exchangeable senior notes of

$563,500

, and a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock of

$323,453

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

when compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in principal payments on notes payable and revolving lines of credit of

$191,128

and a decrease in the cash paid for the repurchase of exchangeable senior notes of

$205,017

.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014

Cash provided by operating activities was $367,329 and $337,581 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change when compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $13,640 increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $18,381. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4,812.

Cash used in investing activities was $1,625,664 and $564,948 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change was primarily the result of an increase of $1,200,853 paid for the acquisition of SmartStop in October 2015. There was also an increase of $55,073 in cash used to purchase/issue notes receivable. These increases in cash outflows were partially offset by an increase of $45,080 in cash received as returns of investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures.

Cash provided by financing activities was $1,286,471 and $148,307 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net increase was due to a number of factors, including an increase of $1,204,138 in the cash proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable and revolving lines of credit, an increase of $446,877 in the cash proceeds received from the sale of common stock, and an increase of $563,500 in the net proceeds from the issuance of exchangeable senior notes. These increases in cash inflows were offset by an increase of $780,442 of cash paid for principal payments on notes payable and revolving lines of credit, an increase of $227,212 in cash paid to repurchase existing exchangeable senior notes, and an increase of $59,211 in cash paid as dividends on our common stock.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had

$43,858

available in cash and cash equivalents. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a REIT.

Our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. During 2016 and 2015, we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents; however, there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.


The following table presents information on our lines of credit for the period presented. All of our lines of credit are guaranteed by us.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had

$4,363,697

face value of debt, resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of

29.6%

.  As of

December 31, 2016

, the ratio of total fixed-rate debt and other instruments to total debt was

70.0%

(including

$2,198,275

on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixed-rate debt). The weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed- and variable-rate debt at

December 31, 2016

was

3.0%

. Certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt. We are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt. We were in compliance with all financial covenants at

December 31, 2016

.

We expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of Operating Partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit, including undrawn portions of our unsecured facility. In addition, we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs.

Our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders, store acquisitions, principal payments under our borrowings and non-recurring capital expenditures. We may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt, shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. In addition, we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships, which may require us to raise additional funds. We do not expect that our operating cash flow or cash balances will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness, joint ventures with third parties, and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt. Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Any additional issuance of equity or equity-linked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock. We may also use Operating Partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from self-storage owners who desire tax-deferral in their exiting transactions.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. Accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table presents information on future payments due by period as of

December 31, 2016

:


The operating leases above include minimum future lease payments on leases for


of our operating stores as well as leases of our corporate offices.

Three

ground leases include additional contingent rental payments based on the level of revenue achieved at the store.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was

3.3%

, and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was

2.3%

.

FINANCING STRATEGY

We will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors. Although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate. In making financing decisions, we will consider factors including but not limited to:

•

the interest rate of the proposed financing;

•

the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our stores;

•

prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing;

•

the purchase price of stores acquired with debt financing;

•

long-term objectives with respect to the financing;

•

target investment returns;

•

the ability of particular stores, and our Company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments;

•

overall level of consolidated indebtedness;

•

timing of debt and lease maturities;

•

provisions that require recourse and cross-collateralization;

•

corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets; and

•

the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt.

Our indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse, cross-collateralized, cross-defaulted, secured or unsecured. If the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular stores to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our stores, or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis. We may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing stores, for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable.

We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt, as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.


SEASONALITY

The self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of July, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late February and early March. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

Item 7a.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future income, cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had approximately

$4.4

billion in total face value debt, of which approximately

$1.3

billion was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately

$13.1

million annually.

Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.

1.     DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Extra Space Storage Inc. (the “Company”) is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”), formed as a Maryland Corporation on April 30, 2004, to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties located throughout the United States. The Company continues the business of Extra Space Storage LLC and its subsidiaries, which had engaged in the self-storage business since 1977. The Company’s interest in its stores is held through its operating partnership, Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating Partnership”), which was formed on May 5, 2004. The Company’s primary assets are general partner and limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be subject to tax, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.

The Company invests in stores by acquiring wholly-owned stores or by acquiring an equity interest in real estate entities. At

December 31, 2016

, the Company had direct and indirect equity interests in

1,016

storage facilities. In addition, the Company managed


stores for third parties bringing the total number of stores which it owns and/or manages to

1,427

. These stores are located in


states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.

The Company operates in

three

distinct segments: (1) rental operations; (2) tenant reinsurance; and (3) property management, acquisition and development. The rental operations activities include rental operations of stores in which the Company has an ownership interest. No single tenant accounts for more than

5.0%

of rental income. Tenant reinsurance activities include the reinsurance of risks relating to the loss of goods stored by tenants in the Company’s stores. The Company’s property management, acquisition and development activities include managing, acquiring, developing and selling stores.

2.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly- or majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. In our Segment Information in Note 19,

$2,857

and

$4,022

of equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures-gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of partners’ interests was reclassified from the rental operations segment to the property management, acquisition and development segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Variable Interest Entities

The Company accounts for arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights as variable interest entities (“VIEs”). An enterprise is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity’s equity holders as a group either: (a) lack the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. If an entity is deemed to be a VIE, the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest, or combination of variable interests, that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the VIE, is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE.

The Company has concluded that under certain circumstances when the Company enters into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a VIE may be created under condition (i), (ii) (b) or (c) of the previous paragraph. For each VIE created, the Company has performed a qualitative analysis, including considering which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each VIE and whether that party has the obligation to absorb


EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(continued)

Amounts in thousands, except store and share data, unless otherwise stated

losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the assets, liabilities and operations of the VIE are consolidated with the Company’s financial statements. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has notes payable to

three

trusts that are VIEs under condition (ii)(a) above. Since the Operating Partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts, these VIEs are not consolidated.

The Company’s investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control, and joint ventures which are VIEs in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value Disclosures

Derivative financial instruments

Currently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate forward curves.

The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. In conjunction with the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s fair value measurement guidance, the Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of

December 31, 2016

, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The table below presents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2016

, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Long-lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. The Company reviews each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. The Company focuses on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. For these stores, the Company determines whether the decrease is temporary or permanent, and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. In addition, the Company reviews stores in the lease-up stage and compares actual operating results to original projections.

When the Company determines that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred, the Company compares the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. An impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets.

When real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value of the assets, net of selling costs. If the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, the Company would recognize a loss on the assets held for sale. The operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company had

two

parcels of undeveloped land classified as held for sale. The estimated fair value less selling costs of these assets is greater than the carrying value of the assets, and therefore no loss has been recorded.

The Company assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. An investment is impaired if management’s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. To the extent impairment has occurred, and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment.

As of

December 31, 2016

and


, the Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, other financial instruments included in other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, variable-rate notes payable, revolving lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at

December 31, 2016

, approximate fair value.

The fair values of the Company’s notes receivable from Preferred Operating Partnership unit holders and other fixed rate notes receivable were based on the discounted estimated future cash flow of the notes (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the discount rate used approximated the current market rate for loans with similar maturities and credit quality. The fair values of the Company’s fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts were estimated using the discounted estimated future cash payments to be made on such debt (categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy); the discount rates used approximated current market rates for loans, or groups of loans, with similar maturities and credit quality. The fair value of the Company’s exchangeable senior notes was estimated using an average market price for similar securities obtained from a third party.


EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(continued)

Amounts in thousands, except store and share data, unless otherwise stated

The fair values of the Company’s fixed-rate assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated:

Real Estate Assets

Real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized. The construction period begins when expenditures for the real estate assets have been made and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use are in progress. The construction period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are generally between

five

and


years.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of operating stores, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, is determined as if vacant. Intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases. The Company measures the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers, which is based on the Company’s historical experience with turnover in its stores. Debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates.

Stores purchased at the time of certificate of occupancy issuance are considered asset acquisitions.  As such, the purchase price is allocated to the land and buildings acquired based on their fair values.  Any debt assumed as part of the acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates.  Acquisition-related transactions costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price.

Intangible lease rights represent: (1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on

three

stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are amortized to expense over the life of the leases and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on

eight

stores where the leases were assumed by the Company at rates that were lower than the current market rates for similar leases. The values associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the lease terms.

Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures

The Company’s investments in real estate joint ventures, where the Company has significant influence, but not control and joint ventures which are VIEs in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Under the equity method, the Company’s investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for the Company’s share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. Equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on the Company’s ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. For the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows, the Company follows the “look through” approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. Under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture’s sale of assets), in which case it is reported as an investing activity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States and at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of

three

months or less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash is comprised of letters of credit and escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States relating to earnest money deposits on potential acquisitions, real estate taxes, insurance and capital expenditures.

Other Assets

Other assets consist of equipment and fixtures, rents receivable by our tenants, investments in trusts, notes receivable, other intangible assets, deferred tax assets, prepaid expenses and the fair value of interest rate swaps. Depreciation of equipment and fixtures is computed on a straight-line basis over


to


years.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.

The Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.

Risk Management and Use of Financial Instruments

In the normal course of its ongoing business operations, the Company encounters economic risk. There are

three

main components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its interest-bearing liabilities. Credit risk is the risk of inability or unwillingness of tenants to make contractually required payments. Market risk is the risk of declines in the value of stores due to changes in rental rates, interest rates or other market factors affecting the value of stores held by the Company. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its interest rate risk.

Exchange of Common Operating Partnership Units

Redemption of common Operating Partnership units for shares of common stock, when redeemed under the original provisions of the Operating Partnership agreement, are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to the Company’s equity.

Revenue and Expense Recognition

Rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. Leases are generally on month-to-month terms. Prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period. Late charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized as income when earned. Management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real

estate entities is recognized based on the Company's ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. Interest income is recognized as earned.

Property expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. The Company accrues for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts, estimates and historical trends. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected.

Tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage. The Company records an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history. The unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end, including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported. The Company uses a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received. The administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported. Annually, a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid claims liability. Prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known. The impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations. The unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value. Each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program. Tenants can purchase policies in amounts of

two thousand

dollars to

ten thousand

dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee. As of

December 31, 2016

, the average insurance coverage for tenants was approximately

two thousand eight hundred

dollars. The Company’s exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant. The Company purchases reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount for any one event. The Company does

not

currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements.

Real Estate Sales

In general, sales of real estate and related profits/losses are recognized when all consideration has changed hands and risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Certain types of continuing involvement preclude sale treatment and related profit recognition; other forms of continuing involvement allow for sale recognition but require deferral of profit recognition.

Advertising Costs

The Company incurs advertising costs primarily attributable to internet, directory and other advertising. These costs are expensed as incurred. The Company recognized

$12,867

,

$10,528

, and

$8,843

in advertising expense for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively, which are included in property operating expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, among other things, the Company is required to distribute at least

90%

of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its income and assets. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to stockholders. The Company plans to continue to operate so that it meets the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If the Company were to fail to meet these requirements, it would be subject to federal income tax. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes. Provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended

December 31, 2016

,

0%

(unaudited) of all distributions to stockholders qualified as a return of capital.

The Company has elected to treat its corporate subsidiary, Extra Space Management, Inc. (“ESMI”), as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). In general, the Company’s TRS may perform additional services for tenants and may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to corporate federal income tax. ESM Reinsurance Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ESMI, generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to corporate federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. At

December 31, 2016

, there were

no

material unrecognized tax benefits. Interest and penalties relating

to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, the Company had

no

interest or penalties related to uncertain tax provisions.

Stock-Based Compensation

The measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors are based on estimated fair values. Awards granted are valued at fair value and any compensation element is recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed using the two-class method by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. All outstanding unvested restricted stock awards contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends and participate in undistributed earnings with common stockholders; accordingly, they are considered participating securities that are included in the two-class method. Diluted earnings per common share measures the performance of the Company over the reporting period while giving effect to all potential common shares that were dilutive and outstanding during the period. The denominator includes the weighted average number of basic shares and the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares that were dilutive had been issued, and is calculated using either the two-class, treasury stock or as if-converted method, whichever is most dilutive. Potential common shares are securities (such as options, convertible debt, Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series A Units”), Series B Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series B Units”), Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series C Units”), Series D Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series D Units”) and common Operating Partnership units (“OP Units”)) that do not have a current right to participate in earnings of the Company but could do so in the future by virtue of their option, redemption or conversion right.

In computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, net income is adjusted to add back any changes in earnings in the period associated with the convertible security. The numerator also is adjusted for the effects of any other non-discretionary changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares. In computing diluted earnings per common share, only potential common shares that are dilutive (those that reduce earnings per common share) are included. For the years ended

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-9, “

Revenue from Contracts with Customers,

” which amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-9 outlines a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers.  ASU 2014-9 includes all contracts with customers to provide goods and services in the ordinary course of business, except for certain contracts that are specifically excluded from the scope, such as lease contracts and insurance contracts. ASU 2014-9 was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the standard. The new standard will now become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption on the original effective date permitted.  The Company has determined that its property rental revenue and tenant reinsurance revenue will not be subject to the guidance in ASU 2014-9, as they qualify as lease contract and insurance contracts, which are excluded from its scope.  The Company's management fee revenue will be included in the scope of ASU 2014-9, however, based on the Company's initial assessment, it appears that revenue recognized under ASU 2014-9 will not differ materially from revenue recognized under existing guidance.  We continue to assess all potential impacts of ASU 2014-9.  The Company anticipates adopting the standard using the modified retrospective transition method as of January 1, 2018.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-3, “

Interest—Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,

” which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The new guidance only impacts financial statement presentation. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2016 and allows for early adoption. The Company adopted this guidance October 1, 2015. The Company adopted ASU 2015-3 on a retrospective basis.


EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,

“Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,”

which provides guidance regarding the classification of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit. Specifically, deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement is allowed. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2015. The Company continued to present the debt issuance costs and related accumulated amortization relating to its lines of credit as assets.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

"Leases (Topic 842),"

which modifies the accounting for leases, intending to increase transparency and comparability of organizations by requiring balance sheet presentation of leased assets and increased financial statement disclosure of leasing arrangements.  ASU 2016-02 will require entities to recognize a liability for their lease obligations and a corresponding asset representing the right to use the underlying asset over the lease term.  Lease obligations are to be measured at the present value and accounted for using the effective interest method.  The accounting for the leased asset will differ slightly depending on whether the agreement is deemed to be a financing or operating lease. For finance leases, the leased asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis and recorded separately from the interest expense in the statements of operations, resulting in higher expense in the earlier part of the lease term. For operating leases, the depreciation and interest expense components are combined, recognized evenly over the term of the lease, and presented as a reduction to operating income. ASU 2016-02 requires that assets and liabilities be presented or disclosed separately, and requires additional disclosure of certain qualitative and quantitative information related to these lease agreements.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption on ASU 2016-02 on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,

"Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business,"

which provides guidance on whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.  Specifically, when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business.  Additionally, ASU 2017-01 also provides other guidance providing a more robust framework to use in determining whether a set of assets and activities is a business.  This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early application of ASU 2017-01 is permitted for transactions for which the acquisition or disposition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued.   The Company plans to apply the guidance in ASU 2017-01 to new acquisitions beginning on January 1, 2017.  The adoption of this guidance will result in a decrease in acquisition related costs, as the Company's acquisition of operating stores will likely be considered asset acquisitions rather than business combinations under ASU 2017-01.

These Excluded Assets were instead sold by SmartStop to Strategic 1031, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Strategic 1031”), prior to the Transaction. The Excluded Assets included

five

SmartStop stores located in Canada, one parcel of land located in California that is under development, and SmartStop’s non-traded REIT platform. Strategic 1031 is owned by and controlled by SmartStop’s former Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors.

stores located in New Jersey and Virginia.  As part of this acquisition, the Company agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net operating income for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2016.  At the acquisition date, the Company recorded an estimated liability related to this earnout provision.  The operating income of these stores during the earnout period has been higher than expected, resulting in an increase in the estimate of the amount due to the sellers of

In these joint ventures, the Company and the joint venture partner generally receive a preferred return on their invested capital. To the extent that cash/profits in excess of these preferred returns are generated through operations or capital transactions, the Company would receive a higher percentage of the excess cash/profits than its equity interest.

In accordance with ASC 810, the Company reviews all of its joint venture relationships quarterly to ensure that there are no entities that require consolidation. As of

December 31, 2016

, there were no previously unconsolidated entities that were required to be consolidated as a result of this review.

The Company has entered into several new real estate ventures.  The Company accounts for its investment in the following ventures under the equity method of accounting.  Information about these real estate ventures is summarized as follows:

On September 16, 2016, subsequent to its acquisition of


properties as outlined in Note 4, the Company sold its

4.42%

interest in PRISA II to Prudential for

$34,758

in cash.  The carrying value of the Company's investment prior to the acquisition was

$3,912

, and the Company recorded a gain on the sale of

$30,846

.  This gain is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

On April 25, 2016, the Company and Prudential entered into the “Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of ESS PRISA LLC” and the “First Amendment to Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of ESS PRISA II LLC” (the “Amendments”).  The Amendments are deemed effective as of April 1, 2016.  Under the Amendments, the Company gave up any future rights to receive distributions from these joint ventures at the higher “excess profit participation” percentage of

17.0%

in exchange for a higher equity ownership percentage.  The Company’s equity ownership in ESS PRISA LLC increased from

2.0%

to

4.0%

, and the Company’s equity ownership in ESS PRISA II LLC increased from

2.0%

to

4.4%

.  The Company continues to account for its investment in PRISA under the equity method of accounting.  The Company subsequently sold its interest in PRISA II as noted above.

In December 2013 and May 2014, the Company acquired

twelve

stores located in California from entities associated with Grupe Properties Co. Inc. (“Grupe.”) As part of the Grupe acquisition, the Company acquired its joint venture partners’

60%

to

65%

equity interests in

six

stores. The Company previously held the remaining

35%

to

40%

interests in these stores through

six

separate joint ventures with Grupe. Prior to the acquisition, the Company accounted for its interests in these joint ventures as equity-method investments. The Company recognized a non-cash gain of

$3,438

during the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of re-measuring the fair value of its equity interest in one of these joint ventures held before the acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded a gain of

$584

as a result of the final cash distributions received from the other

five

joint ventures associated with the acquisitions that were completed during 2013.

Amounts in thousands, except store and share data, unless otherwise stated

On October 14, 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides for aggregate borrowings of up to

$1.15 billion

, consisting of a senior unsecured four-year revolving credit facility of

$500 million

(the “Revolving Credit Facility”), a senior unsecured five-year term loan of up to

$430 million

(the “Five-Year Term Loan Facility”) and a senior unsecured seven-year term loan of up to

$220 million

(the “Seven-Year Term Loan Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Five-Year Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facility”). The Company may request an increase in the amount of the commitments under the Credit Facility up to an aggregate of

$1.5 billion

, and extend the term of the Revolving Credit Facility for up to

two

additional periods of

six

months each, after satisfying certain conditions. The latest date by which capacity may be drawn on The Five-Year Term Loan Facility and Seven-Year Term Loan Facility are October 13, 2017 and April 4, 2017, respectively.  Costs incurred in connection with the Credit Facility were approximately

$8,000

. These costs are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the terms of each loan.

Amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates, at the Company’s option, equal to either (i) LIBOR plus the applicable Eurodollar rate margin or (ii) the applicable base rate which is the applicable margin plus the highest of (a)

0.0%

, (b) the federal funds rate plus

0.50%

, (c) U.S. Bank’s prime rate or (d) the Eurodollar rate plus

1.00%

. The applicable Eurodollar rate margin will range from

1.35%

to

2.50%

per annum and the applicable base rate margin will range from

0.35%

to

1.50%

per annum, in each case depending on the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and the type of loan. If the Operating Partnership obtains a specified investment grade rating from

two

or more specified credit rating agencies, and elects to use the alternative rates based on the Company’s debt rating, the applicable Eurodollar rate margin will range from

0.85%

to

2.45%

per annum and the applicable base rate margin will range from

0.00%

to

1.45%

per annum, in each case depending on the rating achieved and the type of loan.

The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and is not secured by any assets of the Company.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company was in compliance with all of its financial covenants.

All of the Company’s lines of credit are guaranteed by the Company. The following table presents information on the Company’s lines of credit, the proceeds of which are used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes, for the periods indicated:

7.     DERIVATIVES

The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s investments and borrowings.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. A portion of these changes is excluded from accumulated other comprehensive income as it is allocated to noncontrolling interests. During the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. During


, the Company estimates that an additional

$9,244

will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

The following table summarizes the terms of the Company’s


derivative financial instruments, which have a total combined notional amount of

$2,109,486

as of

December 31, 2016

:

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

The table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets:

Effect of Derivative Instruments

The tables below present the effect of the Company’s derivative financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented. No tax effect has been presented as the derivative instruments are held by the Company:

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

The Company has agreements with some of its derivative counterparties that contain provisions pursuant to which, the Company could be declared in default of its derivative obligations if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender.

The Company also has an agreement with some of its derivative counterparties that incorporates the loan covenant provisions of the Company’s indebtedness with a lender affiliate of the derivative counterparty. Failure to comply with the loan covenant provisions would result in the Company being in default on any derivative instrument obligations covered by the agreement.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was

$2,836

. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company had not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions as of

December 31, 2016

, it could have been required to cash settle its obligations under these agreements at their termination value of

$2,836

.

8.     NOTES PAYABLE TO TRUSTS

During July 2005, ESS Statutory Trust III (the “Trust III”), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, issued an aggregate of

$40,000

of preferred securities which mature on

July 31, 2035

. In addition, the Trust III issued

1,238

of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price of

$1,238

. On July 27, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities of

$41,238

were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership (“Note 3”). Note 3 had a fixed rate of

6.91%

through July 31, 2010, and then was payable at a variable rate equal to the

three month LIBOR

plus

2.4%

per annum. Effective July 11, 2011, the Trust III entered into an interest rate swap that fixes the interest rate to be paid at

5.0%

per annum and matures

July 11, 2018

. The interest on Note 3, payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust III to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities became redeemable by the Trust III with

no

prepayment premium on

July 27, 2010

.

During May 2005, ESS Statutory Trust II (the “Trust II”), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership of the Company, issued an aggregate of

$41,000

of preferred securities which mature on

June 30, 2035

. In addition, the Trust II issued

1,269

of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price of

$1,269

. On May 24, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the preferred and common securities of

$42,269


EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership (“Note 2”). Note 2 had a fixed rate of

6.7%

through

June 30, 2010

, and then was payable at a variable rate equal to the

three month LIBOR

plus

2.4%

per annum. Effective July 11, 2011, the Trust II entered into an interest rate swap that fixes the interest rate to be paid at

5.0%

per annum and matures

July 11, 2018

. The interest on Note 2, payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust II to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities became redeemable by the Trust II with

no

prepayment premium on June 30, 2010.

During April 2005, ESS Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”), a newly formed Delaware statutory trust and a wholly-owned, unconsolidated subsidiary of the Operating Partnership of the Company issued an aggregate of

$35,000

of trust preferred securities which mature on

June 30, 2035

. In addition, the Trust issued

1,083

of Trust common securities to the Operating Partnership for a purchase price of

$1,083

. On April 8, 2005, the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred and common securities of

$36,083

were loaned in the form of a note to the Operating Partnership (the “Note”). The Note has a variable rate equal to the

three month LIBOR

plus

2.3%

per annum. Effective June 30, 2010, the Trust entered into an interest rate swap that fixes the interest rate to be paid at

5.1%

per annum and matures on

June 30, 2018

. The interest on the Note, payable quarterly, will be used by the Trust to pay dividends on the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities are redeemable by the Trust with

no

prepayment premium.

Trust, Trust II and Trust III (together, the “Trusts”) are VIEs because the holders of the equity investment at risk (the trust preferred securities) do not have the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly affect the entities’ economic performance because of their lack of voting or similar rights. Because the Operating Partnership’s investment in the Trusts’ common securities was financed directly by the Trusts as a result of its loan of the proceeds to the Operating Partnership, that investment is not considered to be an equity investment at risk. The Operating Partnership’s investment in the Trusts is not a variable interest because equity interests are variable interests only to the extent that the investment is considered to be at risk, and therefore the Operating Partnership cannot be the primary beneficiary of the Trusts. Since the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Trusts, they have not been consolidated. A debt obligation has been recorded in the form of notes as discussed above for the proceeds, which are owed to the Trusts by the Company. The Company has also recorded its investment in the Trusts’ common securities as other assets.

The Company has not provided financing or other support during the periods presented to the Trusts that it was not previously contractually obligated to provide. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the Trusts is equal to the total amount of the notes discussed above less the amounts of the Company’s investments in the Trusts’ common securities. The net amount is the notes payable that the Trusts owe to third parties for their investments in the Trusts’ preferred securities.

The notes payable to trusts are presented net of unamortized deferred financing costs of

$2,269

and

$2,399

as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.

Following is a tabular comparison of the liabilities the Company has recorded as a result of its involvements with the Trusts to the maximum exposure to loss the Company is subject to related to the Trusts as of

9.     EXCHANGEABLE SENIOR NOTES

In September 2015, the Operating Partnership issued

$575,000

of its

3.125%

Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2035. Costs incurred to issue the 2015 Notes were approximately

$11,992

, consisting primarily of a

2.0%

underwriting fee. These costs are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over

five years

, which represents the estimated term based on the first available redemption date, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The 2015 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are fully guaranteed by the Company. Interest is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning April 1, 2016, until the maturity date of October 1, 2035. The Notes bear interest at

3.125%

per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the 2015 Notes may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash (for the principal amount of the 2015 Notes) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, for cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s option. The exchange rate of the 2015 Notes as of

December 31, 2016

was approximately

10.56

shares of the Company’s common stock per

$1,000

principal amount of the 2015 Notes.

The Operating Partnership may redeem the 2015 Notes at any time to preserve the Company’s status as a REIT. In addition, on or after October 5, 2020, the Operating Partnership may redeem the 2015 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at

100%

of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon at least


days but not more than


days prior written notice to the holders of the 2015 Notes. The holders of the 2015 Notes have the right to require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the 2015 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, on October 1 of the years 2020, 2025 and 2030, (unless the Operating Partnership has called the 2015 Notes for redemption), and upon the occurrence of certain designated events, in each case for a repurchase price equal to

100%

of the principal amount of the 2015 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Certain events are considered “Events of Default,” as defined in the indenture governing the 2015 Notes, which may result in the accelerated maturity of the 2015 Notes.

On June 21, 2013, the Operating Partnership issued

$250,000

of its

2.375%

Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2033 at a

1.5%

discount, or

$3,750

. Costs incurred to issue the 2013 Notes were approximately

$1,672

. These costs are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over

five years

, which represents the estimated term based on the first available redemption date, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The 2013 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are fully guaranteed by the Company. Interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year beginning January 1, 2014, until the maturity date of July 1, 2033. The 2013 Notes bear interest at

2.375%

per annum and contain an exchange settlement feature, which provides that the 2013 Notes may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for cash (for the principal amount of the 2013 Notes) and, with respect to any excess exchange value, for cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s option. The exchange rate of the 2013 Notes as of

December 31, 2016

was approximately

18.49

shares of the Company’s common stock per

$1,000

principal amount of the 2013 Notes.

Additionally, the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes can be exchanged during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the common stock of the Company is greater than or equal to

130%

of the exchange price for at least


trading days during a period of


consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The price of the Company’s common stock exceeded

130%

of the exchange price for the required time period for the 2013 Notes during the quarter ended

December 31, 2016

. Therefore, holders of the 2013 Notes may elect to exchange such notes during the quarter ending March 31, 2017. The price of the Company’s common stock did not exceed

130%

of the exchange price for the required time period for the 2015 Notes during the quarter ended

December 31, 2016

.

The Operating Partnership may redeem the 2013 Notes at any time to preserve the Company’s status as a REIT. In addition, on or after July 5, 2018, the Operating Partnership may redeem the 2013 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at

100%

of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon at least


days but not more than


days prior written notice to the holders of the 2013 Notes. The holders of the 2013 Notes have the right to require the Operating Partnership to repurchase the 2013 Notes for cash, in whole or in part, on July 1 of the years 2018, 2023 and 2028, and upon the occurrence of certain designated events, in each case for a repurchase price equal to

100%

of the principal amount of the 2013 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Certain events are considered “Events of Default,” as defined in the indenture governing the 2013 Notes, which may result in the accelerated maturity of the 2013 Notes.

GAAP requires entities with convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost. The Company therefore accounts for the liability and equity components of the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes separately. The equity components are included in paid-in capital in stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets, and

the value of the equity components are treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt components. The discounts are being amortized as interest expense over the remaining period of the debt through its first redemption date, July 1, 2018 for the 2013 Notes and October 1, 2020 for the 2015 Notes. The effective interest rate on the liability components of both the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes is

4.0%

, which approximates the market rate of interest of similar debt without exchange features (i.e. nonconvertible debt) at the time of issuance.

Information about the carrying amount of the equity component, the principal amount of the liability component, its unamortized discount and its net carrying amount were as follows for the periods indicated:

The amount of interest cost recognized relating to the contractual interest rate and the amortization of the discount on the liability component for the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes was as follows for the periods indicated:

Repurchase of 2013 Notes

During April 2016, the Company repurchased a total principal amount of

$2,555

of the 2013 Notes. The Company paid cash for the principal amount and issued a total of

18,031

shares of common stock valued at

$1,686

for the exchange value in excess of the principal amount.

During February 2016, the Company repurchased a total principal amount of

$19,639

of the 2013 Notes. The Company paid cash for the principal amount, and issued a total of

130,909

shares of common stock valued at

$11,380

for the exchange value in excess of the principal amount.

As part of the 2015 Notes offering, the Company repurchased

$164,636

of the 2013 Notes for

$227,212

on September 15, 2015.  The Company allocated the value of the consideration paid to repurchase the 2013 Notes (1) to the extinguishment of the liability component and (2) to the reacquisition of the equity component. The amount allocated to the extinguishment of the liability component is equal to the fair value of that component immediately prior to extinguishment. The difference between the consideration attributed to the extinguishment of the liability component and the sum of (a) the net carrying amount of the repurchased liability component, and (b) the related unamortized debt issuance costs, is recognized as a gain on debt extinguishment. The remaining settlement consideration is allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component of the repurchased 2013 Notes and recognized as a reduction of stockholders’ equity.

13.     NONCONTROLLING INTEREST REPRESENTED BY PREFERRED OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNITS

Classification of Noncontrolling Interests

GAAP requires a company to present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section, but separate from the company’s equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as equity transactions. If noncontrolling interests are determined to be redeemable, they are to be carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity.

The Company has evaluated the terms of the Operating Partnership’s preferred units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by such preferred units as stockholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling amount as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying amount, or (2) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made.

Series A Participating Redeemable Preferred Units

On June 15, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a Contribution Agreement with various limited partnerships affiliated with AAAAA Rent-A-Space to acquire

ten

stores in exchange for

989,980

Series A Units. The stores are located in California and Hawaii.

The partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership (as amended, the “Partnership Agreement”) provides for the designation and issuance of the Series A Units. The Series A Units have priority over all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

Under the Partnership Agreement, Series A Units in the amount of

$115,000

bear a fixed priority return of

5.0%

and have a fixed liquidation value of

$115,000

. The remaining balance participates in distributions with, and has a liquidation value equal to, that of the common OP Units. The Series A Units became redeemable at the option of the holder on September 1, 2008, which redemption obligation may be satisfied, at the Company’s option, in cash or shares of its common stock.

On June 25, 2007, the Operating Partnership loaned the holders of the Series A Units

$100,000

. The note receivable bears interest at

4.85%

. During 2013, a loan amendment was signed extending the maturity date to September 1, 2020. The loan is secured by the borrower’s Series A Units. The holders of the Series A Units could redeem up to

114,500

Series A Units prior to the maturity date of the loan. If any redemption in excess of 114,500 Series A Units occurs prior to the maturity date, the holder

of the Series A Units is required to repay the loan as of the date of that redemption. On October 3, 2014, the holders of the Series A Units redeemed

114,500

Series A Units for

$4,794

in cash and

280,331

shares of common stock.

No

additional redemption of Series A Units can be made without repayment of the loan. The Series A Units are shown on the balance sheet net of the

$100,000

loan because the borrower under the loan receivable is also the holder of the Series A Units.

Series B Redeemable Preferred Units

On April 3, 2014, the Operating Partnership completed the purchase of a store located in Georgia. This store was acquired in exchange for

$15,158

of cash and

333,360

Series B Units valued at

$8,334

.

On August 29, 2013, the Operating Partnership completed the purchase of


out of


stores affiliated with All Aboard Mini Storage, all of which are located in California. On September 26, 2013, the Operating Partnership completed the purchase of the remaining facility. These stores were acquired in exchange for

$100,876

in cash (including

$98,960

of debt assumed and immediately defeased at closing),

1,342,727

Series B Units valued at

$33,568

, and

1,448,108

common OP Units valued at

$62,341

.

The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series B Units. The Series B Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series C Units and Series D Units, and senior to all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

The Series B Units have a liquidation value of

$25.00

per unit for a fixed liquidation value of

$41,903

. Holders of the Series B Units receive distributions at an annual rate of

6.0%

. These distributions are cumulative. The Series B Units are redeemable at the option of the holder on the first anniversary of the date of issuance, which redemption obligations may be satisfied at the Company’s option in cash or shares of its common stock.

Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Units

On November 19, 2013, the Operating Partnership entered into Contribution Agreements with various entities affiliated with Grupe, under which the Company agreed to acquire

twelve

stores, all of which are located in California. The Company completed the purchase of these stores between December 2013 and May 2014. The Company previously held a

35%

interest in

five

of these stores and a

40%

interest in

one

store all through

six

separate joint ventures with Grupe. These stores were acquired in exchange for a total of approximately

$45,722

of cash, the assumption of

$37,532

in existing debt, and the issuance of

704,016

Series C Units valued at

$30,960

.

The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series C Units. The Series C Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series B Units and Series D Units, and senior to all other partnership interests of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

The Series C Units have a liquidation value of

$42.10

per unit for a fixed liquidation value of

$29,639

. From issuance to the fifth anniversary of issuance, each Series C Unit holder will receive quarterly distributions equal to the quarterly distribution for common OP Unit plus

$0.18

. Beginning on the fifth anniversary of issuance, each Series C Unit holder will receive a fixed quarterly distribution equal to the aggregate quarterly distribution payable in respect of such Series C Unit during the four quarters immediately preceding the fifth anniversary of issuance divided by four. These distributions are cumulative. The Series C Units will become redeemable at the option of the holder

one year

from the date of issuance, which redemption obligation may be satisfied at the Company’s option in cash or shares of its common stock. The Series C Units will also become convertible into common OP Units at the option of the holder

one year

from the date of issuance, at a rate of

0.9145

common OP Units per Series C Unit converted. This conversion option expires upon the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance.

In December 2014, the Operating Partnership loaned holders of the Series C Units

$20,230

. The notes receivable, which are collateralized by the Series C Units, bear interest at

5.0%

and mature on December 15, 2024. The Series C Units are shown on the balance sheet net of the

$20,230

loan because the borrower under the loan receivable is also the holder of the Series C Units.

The Partnership Agreement provides for the designation and issuance of the Series D Units. The Series D Units rank junior to the Series A Units, on parity with the Series B Units and Series C Units, and senior to all other partnership interest of the Operating Partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation.

The Series D Units have a liquidation value of

$25.00

per unit, for a fixed liquidation value of

In addition, the D-3 Units are exchangeable for common OP Units until the tenth anniversary of the date of issuance.  The D-1 Units and D-4 Units are not exchangeable for common OP Units.

14.     NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

The Company’s interest in its stores is held through the Operating Partnership. ESS Holding Business Trust I, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. ESS Business Trust II, also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a limited partner of the Operating Partnership. Between its general partner and limited partner interests, the Company held a

91.2%

majority ownership interest therein as of

December 31, 2016

. The remaining ownership interests in the Operating Partnership (including Preferred Operating Partnership units) of

8.8%

are held by certain former owners of assets acquired by the Operating Partnership.

The noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership represents OP Units that are not owned by the Company. In conjunction with the formation of the Company and as a result of subsequent acquisitions, certain persons and entities contributing interests in stores to the Operating Partnership received limited partnership units in the form of OP Units. Limited partners who received OP Units in the formation transactions or in exchange for contributions for interests in stores have the right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or all of their OP Units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s common stock (based on the

ten

-day average trading price) at the time of the redemption. Alternatively, the Company may, at its sole discretion, elect to acquire those OP Units in exchange for shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to anti-dilution adjustments provided in the Operating Partnership agreement. The

ten

-day average closing stock price at

December 31, 2016

, was

$74.87

and there were

5,608,038

OP Units outstanding.

Assuming that all of the OP Unit holders exercised their right to redeem all of their OP Units on

December 31, 2016

and the Company elected to pay the OP Unit holders cash, the Company would have paid

GAAP requires a company to present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company’s equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and requires changes in ownership interest to be accounted for similarly as equity transactions. If noncontrolling interests are determined to be redeemable, they are to be carried at their redemption value as of the balance sheet date and reported as temporary equity.

The Company has evaluated the terms of the common OP Units and classifies the noncontrolling interest represented by the common OP Units as stockholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company will periodically evaluate individual noncontrolling interests for the ability to continue to recognize the noncontrolling amount as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Any noncontrolling interests that fail to qualify as permanent equity will be reclassified as temporary equity and adjusted to the greater of (1) the carrying amount, or (2) its redemption value as of the end of the period in which the determination is made.

15.     OTHER NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Other noncontrolling interests represent the ownership interest of a third party in

one

consolidated joint venture as of

December 31, 2016

. This joint venture owns an operating store in Texas. The voting interest of the third-party owner is

20.0%

. Other noncontrolling interests are included in the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The income or losses attributable to this third-party owner based on its ownership percentage are reflected in net income allocated to Operating Partnership and other noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations.

On August 1, 2016, the Company purchased its joint venture partner's remaining

3.3%

interest in an existing joint venture in exchange for

8,889

OP Units, valued at

$800

.  This joint venture owned

one

store located in California, and as a result of this purchase, this store became wholly-owned by the Company.  Prior to this acquisition, the partner's interest was reported in other noncontrolling interests.  Since the Company retained its controlling interest in the joint venture, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction.  The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest was reduced to

zero

to reflect the purchase, and the difference between the price paid by the Company and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity attributable to the Company.

On June 11, 2015, the Company purchased its joint venture partner’s remaining

1%

interest in the HSRE joint venture for

$1,267

. The joint venture owned


properties in California, Florida, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, and as a result of this purchase, these properties became wholly-owned by the Company. Prior to this acquisition, the partner’s interest was reported in other noncontrolling interests. Since the Company retained its controlling interest in the subsidiary, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest was reduced to

zero

to reflect the purchase, and the difference between the price paid by the Company and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity attributable to the Company.

Option grants are issued with an exercise price equal to the closing price of stock on the date of grant. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee (“CNG Committee”) at the time of grant, options shall vest ratably over a

four

-year period beginning on the date of grant. Each option wi

mined by the CNG Committee, but under no circumstances may be exercised if such exercise would cause a violation of the ownership limit in the Company’s charter. Options expire


years from the date of grant.

Also as defined under the terms of the Plan, restricted stock grants may be awarded. The stock grants are subject to a vesting period over which the restrictions are released and the stock certificates are given to the grantee. During the performance or vesting period, the grantee is not permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or assign shares of restricted stock granted under the Plan; however, the grantee has the ability to vote the shares and receive nonforfeitable dividends paid on shares. Unless otherwise determined by the CNG Committee at the time of grant, the forfeiture and transfer restrictions on the shares lapse over a

four

-year period beginning on the date of grant.

Option Grants

A summary of stock option activity is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of


and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on

Amounts in thousands, except store and share data, unless otherwise stated

The Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions to value stock-based awards. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for the estimated life of the option. The Company uses actual historical data to calculate the expected price volatility, dividend yield and average expected term. The forfeiture rate, which is estimated at a weighted-average of

5.0%

of unvested options outstanding as of

December 31, 2016

, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimates.

A summary of stock options outstanding and exercisable as of

December 31, 2016

, is as follows:

The Company recorded compensation expense relating to outstanding options of

$729

,

$510

and

December 31, 2016

, there was

$1,442

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.30

years. The valuation model applied in this calculation utilizes subjective assumptions that could potentially change over time, including the expected forfeiture rate. Therefore, the amount of unrecognized compensation expense at

December 31, 2016

, noted above does not necessarily represent the expense that will ultimately be realized by the Company in the statement of operations.

Common Stock Granted to Employees and Directors

The Company recorded

, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimates. At

there was

$14,141

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings and is subject to various claims and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, management establishes an accrued liability for litigation when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. The estimated loss, if any, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. Therefore, any estimate(s) of loss disclosed below represents what management believes to be an estimate of loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria and does not represent the Company's maximum loss exposure. The Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in any particular period, notwithstanding the fact that the Company is currently vigorously defending any legal proceedings against it.

The Company currently has several legal proceedings pending against it that include causes of action alleging wrongful foreclosure, violations of various state specific self-storage statutes, and violations of various consumer fraud acts. As a result of these litigation matters, the Company has a liability of

$5,600

as of

December 31, 2016

, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Item 9A.     Controls and Procedures

(i)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

We have a disclosure committee that is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure obligations of the Company on a timely basis. The disclosure committee meets quarterly and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.

(ii)

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

(a)

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2016

. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued the following attestation report over our internal control over financial reporting.

(b)

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Extra Space Storage Inc.

We have audited Extra Space Storage Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Extra Space Storage Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Extra Space Storage Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Extra Space Storage Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Extra Space Storage Inc. and our report dated February 27, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
