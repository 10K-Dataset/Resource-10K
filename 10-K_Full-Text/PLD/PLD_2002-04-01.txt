PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation,
is one of the leading owners and operators of industrial real
estate nationwide. Our investment strategy is to become a
leading provider of High Throughput Distribution, or HTD,
properties located near key passenger and cargo airports,
highway systems and ports in major metropolitan areas, such as
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Northern New Jersey/ New
York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California,
Miami, and Seattle. Within each of our markets, we focus our
investments in in-fill submarkets. In-fill sub-markets are
characterized by supply constraints on the availability of land
for competing projects as well as by having physical, political,
or economic barriers to new development. High Throughput
Distribution facilities are designed to serve the high-speed,
high-value freight handling needs of today’s supply chain,
as opposed to functioning as long-term storage facilities. We
believe that the growth of the airfreight and ocean-going
container business and the outsourcing of supply chain
management to third party logistics companies are indicative of
the changes that are occurring in the supply chain and the
manner in which goods are distributed. In addition, we believe
that inventory levels as a percentage of final sales are falling
and that goods are moving more rapidly through the supply chain.
As a result, we intend to focus our investment activities
primarily on industrial properties that we believe will benefit
from these changes.

As of December 31, 2001, we owned and
operated 905 industrial buildings and seven retail centers,
totaling approximately 81.6 million rentable square feet,
located in 26 markets nationwide. As of December 31, 2001,
our industrial and retail properties were 94.5% and 89.3%
leased, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, through our
subsidiary, AMB Capital Partners, LLC, we also managed
industrial buildings and retail centers, totaling approximately
2.7 million rentable square feet on behalf of various
clients. In addition, we have invested in 40 industrial
buildings, totaling approximately 4.9 million rentable
square feet, through unconsolidated joint ventures.

As of December 31, 2001, we had seven retail
centers and three industrial properties, which were held for
divestiture. During 2001, we disposed of 26 industrial buildings
and two retail buildings, aggregating approximately 3.2 million
rentable square feet, for an aggregate price of
$193.4 million. Over the next few years, we intend to
dispose of non-strategic assets and redeploy the resulting
capital into industrial properties in supply constrained markets
in the U.S. and internationally that better fit our current
investment focus.

Through our subsidiary, AMB Property, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership, we are engaged in the acquisition,
ownership, operation, management, renovation, expansion, and
development of primarily industrial properties in target markets
nationwide. We refer to AMB Property, L.P. as the
“operating partnership”. As of December 31, 2001,
we owned an approximate 94.4% general partnership interest in
the operating partnership, excluding preferred units. As the
sole general partner of the operating partnership, we have the
full, exclusive, and complete responsibility and discretion in
the day-to-day management and control of the operating
partnership.

We are self-administered and self-managed and
expect that we have qualified and will continue to qualify as a
real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes
beginning with the year ending December 31, 1997. As a
self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust,
our own employees perform our administrative and management
functions, rather than our relying on an outside manager for
these services. Our principal executive office is located at
Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, CA 94111, and our telephone number
is (415) 394-9000. We also maintain a regional office in
Boston, Massachusetts. As of December 31, 2001, we employed
179 individuals, 134 at our San Francisco headquarters and 45 in
our Boston office.

Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms
“we,” “us,” and “our” refer to AMB
Property Corporation, the operating partnership and the other
controlled subsidiaries, and the references to AMB Property
Corporation include the operating partnership and the other
controlled subsidiaries. The following marks are our registered

Co-investment Joint Ventures

Through the operating partnership, we enter into
co-investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These
co-investment joint ventures provide us with an additional
source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development
projects, and renovation projects. As of December 31, 2001,
we had investments in five co-investment joint ventures with a
gross book value of $1.3 billion, which are consolidated
for financial reporting purposes and which are discussed below.
We believe that our co-investment program will also continue to
serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and developments.

The operating partnership is the managing general
partner of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P. and, together
with one of our other affiliates, owned, as of December 31,
2001, approximately 21% of the partnership interests in the
Alliance Fund I. The Alliance Fund I is a co-investment
partnership between us and AMB Institutional Alliance REIT I,
Inc., a limited partner of the Alliance Fund I, which includes
15 institutional investors as stockholders. The Alliance Fund I
is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management,
renovation, expansion, and development of industrial buildings
in target markets nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, the
Alliance Fund I had received equity contributions from third
party investors totaling $169.0 million, which, when
combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment,
creates a total capitalization of $378.0 million.

We formed AMB Partners II, L.P. with the City and
County of San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System to
acquire, develop, and redevelop distribution facilities
nationwide. On February 14, 2001, AMB Partners II received
an equity contribution from CCSFERS of $50.0 million,
which, when combined with anticipated debt financings and our
investment, creates a total planned capitalization of
$250.0 million. The operating partnership is the managing
general partner of AMB Partners II and owned, as of
December 31, 2001, 50% of AMB Partners II.

We formed AMB-SGP, L.P. with a subsidiary of GIC
Real Estate Pte Ltd., the real estate investment subsidiary of
the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, to own and
operate, through a private real estate investment trust,
distribution facilities nationwide. On March 23, 2001,
AMB-SGP received an equity contribution from GIC of
$75.0 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt
financings and our investment, creates a total planned
capitalization of $335.0 million. The operating partnership
is the managing general partner of AMB-SGP and owned, as of
December 31, 2001, approximately 50.3% of AMB-SGP.

We formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II,
L.P., in which AMB Alliance REIT II, Inc. became a partner on
June 28, 2001. The operating partnership is the managing
general partner and, together with one of our other affiliates,
owned, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 20% of the
partnership interests in the Alliance Fund II. The Alliance Fund
II is a co-investment partnership between us and AMB
Institutional Alliance REIT II, Inc., a limited partner of the
Alliance Fund II, which includes 12 institutional investors as
stockholders as of December 31, 2001. The Alliance Fund II
is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management,
renovation, expansion, and development of industrial buildings
in target markets nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, the
Alliance Fund II had received equity commitments from third
party investors totaling $195.4 million, which, when
combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment,
creates a total planned capitalization of $488.0 million.

The operating partnership, together with one of
our other affiliates, owns, as of December 31, 2001,
approximately 50% of the partnership interests in AMB/ Erie.
L.P. or “Erie”. Erie is a co-investment partnership
between the operating partnership and various entities related
to Erie Indemnity Company, and is engaged in the acquisition,
ownership, operation, management, renovation, expansion, and
development of industrial buildings in target markets
nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, Erie had received
equity



contributions from third party investors totaling
$14.0 million, which, when combined with debt financings
and the Company’s investment, created a total
capitalization of $129.0 million.

Acquisition and Development Activity

During 2001, we invested $428.3 million in
operating properties, consisting of 65 industrial buildings
aggregating approximately 6.8 million square feet,
including the investment of $219.5 million in 36 industrial
buildings, aggregating approximately 3.8 million square
feet, for three of our co-investment joint ventures.

During 2001, we also contributed
$539.2 million in operating properties, consisting of 111
industrial buildings aggregating approximately 10.8 million
square feet, to three of our co-investment joint ventures.
During 2001, we recognized gains of $17.8 million on the
contributions, which represents the portion of the contributed
properties acquired by our third-party co-investors..

As of December 31, 2001, we and our
co-investment partners had in our development pipeline:
(1) 12 industrial projects, which will total approximately
3.1 million square feet and have a total estimated
investment of $154.4 million upon completion; and
(2) two development projects available for sale, which will
total approximately 0.6 million square feet and have an
aggregate estimated investment of $50.0 million upon
completion. As of December 31, 2001, we and our Development
Alliance Partners have funded an aggregate of
$127.3 million and will need to fund an estimated
additional $77.1 million in order to complete projects currently
under construction.

Operating Strategy

We are a full-service real estate company with
in-house expertise in acquisitions, development and
redevelopment, asset management and leasing, finance and
accounting, and market research. We have long-standing
relationships with many real estate management and development
firms across the country, our Strategic Alliance Partners.

We believe that real estate is fundamentally a
local business and that the most effective way for us to operate
is by forging alliances with service providers in every market.
We believe that these collaborations allow us to:
(1) leverage our national presence with the local market
expertise of brokers, developers, and property managers;
(2) improve the operating efficiency and flexibility of our
national portfolio; (3) strengthen customer satisfaction
and retention; and (4) provide a continuous pipeline of
growth.

We believe that our partners give us local market
expertise and flexibility allowing us to focus on our core
competencies: developing and refining our strategic approach to
real estate investment and management and raising private
capital to finance growth and enhance returns to stockholders.

Growth Strategies

Growth Through Operations

We seek to generate internal growth through rent
increases on existing space and renewals on re-tenanted space.
We do this by seeking to maintain a high occupancy rate at our
properties and by seeking to control expenses by capitalizing on
the economies of owning, operating, and growing a large national
portfolio. As of December 31, 2001, our industrial
properties and retail centers were 94.5% leased and 89.3%
leased, respectively. During 2001, we increased average
industrial base rental rates (on a cash basis) by 20.4% from the
expiring rent for that space, on leases entered into or renewed
during the period. This amount excludes expense reimbursements,
rental abatements, and percentage rents. During 2001, we also
increased same-store net operating income by 6.3% on our
industrial properties.

Growth Through Acquisitions and Capital
	Redeployment

We believe that our significant acquisition
experience, our alliance-based operating strategy, and our
extensive network of property acquisition sources will continue
to provide opportunities for external growth. We believe that
our relationships with third party local property management
firms through our Management



Alliance Program also will create acquisition
opportunities, as such managers market properties on behalf of
sellers. Our operating structure also enables us to acquire
properties through our UPREIT Alliance Program in exchange for
limited partnership units in the operating partnership, thereby
enhancing our attractiveness to owners and developers seeking to
transfer properties on a tax-deferred basis. In addition to
acquisitions, we seek to redeploy capital from non-strategic
assets into properties that better fit our current investment
focus.

We are generally in various stages of
negotiations for a number of acquisitions and dispositions,
which may include acquisitions and dispositions of individual
properties, acquisitions of large multi-property portfolios, and
acquisitions of other real estate companies. There can be no
assurance that we will consummate any of these transactions.
Such transactions, if we consummate them, may be material
individually or in the aggregate. Sources of capital for
acquisitions may include undistributed cash flow from
operations, borrowings under our unsecured credit facility,
other forms of secured or unsecured debt financing, issuances of
debt or equity securities by us or the operating partnership
(including issuances of units in the operating partnership or
its subsidiaries), proceeds from divestitures of properties, and
assumption of debt related to the acquired properties.

Growth Through Development

We believe that renovation and expansion of
properties and development of well-located, high-quality
industrial properties should continue to provide us with
attractive opportunities for increased cash flow and a higher
rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of fully
leased, renovated properties. Value-added properties are
typically characterized as properties with available space or
near-term leasing exposure, undeveloped land acquired in
connection with another property that provides an opportunity
for development, or properties that are well located but require
redevelopment or renovation. Value-added properties require
significant management attention or capital investment to
maximize their return. We believe that we have developed the
in-house expertise to create value through acquiring and
managing value-added properties and believe that our national
market presence and expertise will enable us to continue to
generate and capitalize on these opportunities. Through our
Development Alliance Program, we have established strategic
alliances with national and regional developers to enhance our
development capabilities.

The multidisciplinary backgrounds of our
employees should provide us with the skills and experience to
capitalize on strategic renovation, expansion, and development
opportunities. Several of our officers have extensive experience
in real estate development, both with us and with national
development firms. We generally pursue development projects in
joint ventures with local developers. This way, we leverage the
development skill, access to opportunities, and capital of such
developers, and we eliminate the need and expense of an in-house
development staff. Under a typical joint venture agreement with
a Development Alliance Partner, we would fund 95% of the
construction costs and our partner would fund 5%. Upon
completion, we generally would purchase our partner’s
interest in the joint venture.

Growth Through Co-Investments

We co-invest with third party partners (some of
whom may be clients of AMB Capital Partners, LLC, to the extent
such clients commit new investment capital), through
partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint ventures. We
currently use a co-investment formula with each third party
whereby we will own at least a 20% interest in all ventures. In
general, we control all significant operating and investment
decisions of our co-investment entities. We believe that our
co-investment program will continue to serve as a source of
capital for acquisitions and developments; however, there can be
no assurance that it will continue to do so.

Growth Through Developments for
	Sale

The operating partnership, through a wholly-owned
subsidiary, Headlands Realty Corporation, conducts a variety of
businesses that include incremental income programs, such as our
development projects available for sale to third parties. Such
development properties include value-added conversion projects
and build-to-sell projects. During 2001, we completed and sold
two value-added conversion projects for a net gain of
$13.2 million. As of December 31, 2001, we were
developing two projects for sale to third parties.



AMB Capital Partners

AMB Capital Partners, LLC provides real estate
investment management services on a fee basis to clients. On
December 31, 2001, AMB Investment Management, Inc. was
reorganized through a series of related transactions into AMB
Capital Partners. On May 31, 2001, the operating
partnership began consolidating its investment in AMB Investment
Management by acquiring 100% of its common stock for
$0.3 million. Prior to May 31, 2001, the operating
partnership owned 100% of AMB Investment Management’s
non-voting preferred stock (representing a 95% economic interest
therein) and reflected its investment using the equity method.

BUSINESS RISKS

See: “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Business Risks” for a complete
discussion of the various risks that could adversely affect us.

Item 2.

Properties

We operate industrial and retail properties
nationwide and manage our business both by property type and by
market. Industrial properties consist primarily of warehouse
distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple
customers and are typically comprised of multiple buildings that
are leased to customers engaged in various types of businesses.
As of December 31, 2001, we operated industrial properties
in eight hub and gateway markets in addition to 18 other markets
nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, we operated retail
properties in Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, the San Francisco Bay
Area, Boston, and Baltimore. Retail properties are generally
leased to one or more anchor customers, such as grocery and drug
stores, and various retail businesses. See “Item 14.
Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
segment information related to our operations.

INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2001, we owned 905
industrial buildings aggregating approximately 81.6 million
rentable square feet, located in 26 markets nationwide. Our
industrial properties accounted for $494.9 million, or
96.8%, of our total annualized base rent as of December 31,
2001. Our industrial properties were 94.5% leased to over 2,900
customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than 1.3%
of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties.

Property Characteristics.

Our industrial properties, which
consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable
for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of
multiple buildings. The following table identifies type and
characteristics of our industrial buildings:

Lease Terms.

Our
industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a
“triple net basis,” in which customers pay their
proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, and
operating costs, or are subject to leases on a “modified
gross basis,” in which customers pay expenses over certain
threshold levels. Lease terms typically range from three to ten
years, with an average of six years, excluding renewal options.
The majority of the industrial leases do not include renewal
options.



Overview of Major Target Markets.

Our industrial properties are located
near key passenger and air cargo airports, key interstate
highways, and sea ports in major metropolitan areas, such as
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Northern New Jersey,
the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California, Miami, and
Seattle. We believe our industrial properties’ strategic
location, transportation network and infrastructure, and large
consumer and manufacturing bases support strong demand for
industrial space.

Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial
properties are concentrated in locations with limited new
construction opportunities within established, relatively large
submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of
occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere.
These in-fill locations are typically near major passenger and
air cargo facilities, seaports or convenient to major highways
and rail lines, and are proximate to a diverse labor pool. There
is typically broad demand for industrial space in these
centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries
and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution,
light assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations
at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer
supply constraints.

Industrial Market Operating
Statistics

As of December 31, 2001, we operated in
eight hub and gateway markets, in addition to 18 other markets

Development Projects Held for Sale

Properties Held Through Joint Ventures,
Limited Liability Companies, and Partnerships

Consolidated:

As of December 31, 2001, we held interests
in joint ventures, limited liability companies, and partnerships
with third parties, which are consolidated in our consolidated
financial statements. Such investments are consolidated because:
(1) we own a majority interest; or (2) we exercise
significant control over major operating decisions such as
approval of budgets, selection of property managers, and changes
in financing. Under the agreements governing the joint ventures,
we and the other party to the joint venture may be required to
make additional capital contributions, and subject to certain
limitations, the joint ventures may incur additional debt. Such
agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of
joint venture interests by us or the other party to the joint
venture and provide certain rights to us or the other party to
the joint venture to sell its interest to the joint venture or
to the other joint venture partner on terms specified in the
agreement. All of the joint ventures terminate in 2024 or later,
but may end earlier if a joint venture ceases to hold any
interest in or have any obligations relating to the property
held by the joint venture. See “Item 14. Note 10 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”



Industrial Consolidated Joint
Ventures



Retail Consolidated Joint Ventures

Unconsolidated and Mortgage
	Investments:

As of December 31, 2001, we held interests
in three equity investment joint ventures that are
unconsolidated in our financial statements. The management and
control over significant aspects of these investments are with
the third party joint venture partner. In addition, as of
December 31, 2001, we held two mortgage investments from
which we receive interest income.

	increased the interest rate to 9.5% from 8.75% in 2001.

Secured Debt

As of December 31, 2001, we had
$1.2 billion of indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums,
secured by deeds of trust on 99 properties. As of
December 31, 2001, the total gross investment value of
those properties secured by debt was $2.3 billion. Of the
$1.2 billion of secured indebtedness, $759.4 million was
joint venture debt. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Item 14.
Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”
included in this report. We believe that as of December 31,
2001, the value of the properties securing the respective
obligations in each case exceeded the principal amount of the
outstanding obligations.

SELECTED COMPANY AND PREDECESSOR FINANCIAL AND
OTHER DATA

The following table sets forth selected
consolidated historical financial and other data for AMB
Property Corporation and its predecessor on an historical basis
as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000,
1999, 1998, and 1997. Prior to November 26, 1997 (our
initial public offering date), AMB Property Corporation’s
predecessor provided real estate investment management services
to institutional investors.



net income and cash flows, operating earnings
	provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the
	ability of a real estate investment trust to incur and service
	debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures.
	Operating earnings is not a measurement of operating performance
	calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States and should not be considered as a
	substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from
	operations, or other statement of operations or cash flow data
	prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States. Operating earnings may not be
	indicative of our historical operating results nor our potential
	future results. While operating earnings is frequently used as a
	measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service
	requirements, it is not necessarily comparable to other
	similarly titled captions of other real estate investment trusts.

Funds from Operations, or FFO, is defined as
	income from operations before minority interest, gains or losses
	from sale of real estate, and extraordinary losses plus real
	estate depreciation and adjustment to derive our pro rata share
	of the FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures, less minority
	interests’ pro rata share of the FFO of consolidated joint
	ventures and preferred stock dividends. In accordance with the
	National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust White Paper
	on funds from operations, we include the effects of
	straight-line rents in funds from operations. We believe that
	funds from operations is an appropriate measure of performance
	for a real estate investment trust. While funds from operations
	is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance
	of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash
	flow from operations or net income as defined by accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States and it should
	not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in
	evaluating liquidity or operating performance. Further, funds
	from operations as disclosed by other real estate investment
	trusts may not be comparable.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

You should read the following discussion and
analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of
operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated
financial statements. Statements contained in this discussion
that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements.
Such statements relate to our future performance and plans,
results of operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and
operating improvements and costs. You can identify
forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking
terminology such as “believes,” “expects,”
“may,” “will,” “should,”
“seeks,” “approximately,”
“intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,”
“estimates,” or “anticipates‘ or the
negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases.
You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions
of strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements
involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely
upon them as predictions of future events. There is no assurance
that the events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking
statements will occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements
are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data, or methods that
may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize
them.

The following factors, among others, could
cause actual results and future events to differ materially from
those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking
statements:



Our success also depends upon economic trends
generally, including interest rates, income tax laws,
governmental regulation, legislation, population changes, and
those other risk factors discussed in the section entitled
“Business Risks” in this report. We caution you not to
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which
reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this
report or as of the dates indicated in the statements.

GENERAL

We commenced operations as a fully integrated
real estate company in connection with the completion of our
initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected
to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856
through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our
initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997.
AMB Property Corporation and the operating partnership were
formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public
offering.

We generate revenue primarily from rent received
from customers at our properties, including reimbursements from
customers for certain operating costs. In addition, our growth
is, in part, dependent on our ability to increase occupancy
rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability
to continue the acquisition and development of additional
properties. Our income would be adversely affected if a
significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we
were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms.
Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment
in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes,
and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when
circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property.
Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership,
we generally will be liable for all of the operating
partnership’s unsatisfied obligations other than
non-recourse obligations, including the operating
partnership’s obligations as the general partner of the
co-investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could
adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price
of, our stock.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The preparation of these financial statements requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our
assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. We believe the following critical accounting
policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

REIT Compliance.

We
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code
commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997.
We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate
investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe
that our current organization and method of operation comply
with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal
Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real
estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have
been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow
us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our
future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.



Qualification as a real estate investment trust
requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual
and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly
technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which
there are only limited judicial and administrative
interpretations, and involves the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our
control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate
investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross
income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must
pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90%
of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined
without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding
capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a
quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury
regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our
assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new
regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions
could significantly change the tax laws with respect to
qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal
income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are
not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely
affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust.

If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment
trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay
federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum
tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we
are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we
would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment
trust for the four taxable years following the year during which
we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment
trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or
distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for
each of the years involved and we would no longer be required to
make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our annual
fee on our unsecured credit facility may increase and certain
rights that preferred limited partnership unitholders in our
affiliates have to exchange their preferred units for shares of
our preferred stock may be triggered.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in real estate are stated
at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be
recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is
reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying values for financial
reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a
property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may
not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated
expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The
estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently
uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future
market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
amount of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period
in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property
is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property
over its estimated fair value is charged to income. We evaluated
our properties held for divestiture and operating properties for
impairment and reduced their carrying value by
$18.6 million and $5.9 million in 2001 and 2000,
respectively. We believe that there are no additional
impairments of the carrying values of our investments in real
estate at December 31, 2001.

Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.

We have non-controlling limited
partnership interests in three separate unconsolidated joint
ventures. We account for the joint ventures using the equity
method of accounting. We have a 56.1% interest in a joint
venture, which owns an aggregate of 36 industrial buildings
totaling approximately 4.0 million square feet. We also
have a 50% interest in each of two other operating and
development alliance joint ventures. Our net equity investment
in these joint ventures is shown as Investment in unconsolidated
joint ventures on our consolidated balance sheets.

Investments in Other Companies.

Investments in other companies were
accounted for on a cost basis and realized gains and losses were
included in current earnings. For our investments in private
companies, we periodically reviewed our investments to determine
if the value of such investments had been permanently impaired.
During 2001, we recognized a loss on our investments in other
companies totaling $20.8 million, including our investment
in Webvan Group, Inc. We had previously recognized gains and
losses on our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. as a component of
other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2001, we had
realized a loss on 100% of our investments in other companies.



Rental Revenues.

We
record rental revenue from long-term operating leases on a
straight-line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an
allowance for estimated losses that may result from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. If
customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are
greater than our bad-debt reserves, then we may have to
recognize additional bad debt charges in future periods.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The analysis below includes changes attributable
to acquisitions, development activity and divestitures and the
changes resulting from properties that we owned during both the
current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development
properties prior to being stabilized (generally defined as 90%
leased or 12 months after we receive a certificate of
occupancy for the building). We refer to these properties as the
same store properties. For the comparison between the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the same store industrial
properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately
60.2 million square feet. The properties acquired in 2000
consisted of 145 buildings, aggregating approximately
10.5 million square feet, and the properties acquired
during 2001 consisted of 65 buildings, aggregating 6.8 million
square feet. In 2000, property divestitures consisted of one
retail center and 25 industrial buildings, aggregating
approximately 2.5 million square feet, and property
divestitures during 2001 consisted of 24 industrial and two
retail buildings, aggregating approximately 3.2 million
square feet. Our future financial condition and results of
operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the
acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our
future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical
rates.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and

The growth in rental revenues in same store
properties resulted primarily from the incremental effect of
cash rental rate increases on renewals and rollovers, fixed rent
increases on existing leases, and reimbursement of expenses,
partially offset by lower average occupancies. During 2001, the
same store rent increases on industrial renewals and rollovers
(cash basis) was 23.5% on 10.0 million square feet leased.

The $6.7 million increase in investment
management income was due primarily to increased asset
management and acquisition fees and priority distributions from
our co-investment joint ventures. The $9.8 million increase
in interest and other income was primarily due to interest
income from our mortgage note on the retail center that we sold
in 2000 and from interest income resulting from higher average
cash balances.



The increase in same store properties’
operating expenses primarily relates to increases in common area
maintenance expenses of $2.3 million, real estate taxes of
$2.5 million, and insurance expense of $0.8 million.

The increase in interest expense was primarily
due to the issuance of additional unsecured senior debt
securities and an increase in secured debt balances, partially
offset by decreased borrowings on our unsecured credit facility.
The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co-investment
joint ventures’ properties. The increase in depreciation
expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real
estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was
primarily due to increased personnel and occupancy costs. In
addition, the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc.
(predecessor-in-interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and
Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001, resulted in
an increase in general and administrative expenses of
$4.9 million.

During 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of
losses on investments in other companies, related to our
investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology-related
companies. The loss reflects a 100% write-down of the book value
of the investments.

During 2001, we retired $55.2 million of
secured debt prior to maturity primarily in connection with
property divestitures and early prepayments. We recognized a net
extraordinary loss of $0.6 million related to the early
retirement of debt, resulting from prepayment penalties,
partially offset by the write-off of debt premiums.

For the Years Ended December 31, 2000 and



The growth in rental revenues in same store
properties resulted primarily from the incremental effect of
cash rental rate increases, fixed rent increases on existing
leases, increases in occupancy and reimbursement of expenses,
partially offset by a decrease in straight-line rents. During
2000, the same store base rents increase on renewals and
rollovers (cash basis) was 28.0% on 9.8 million square feet
leased.

The $7.0 million increase in investment
management and other income was due primarily to increased
acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P.,
interest income, and development fees.

The change in same store properties’
operating expenses primarily relates to increases in real estate
taxes of $2.0 million for 2000, partially offset by
decreases in insurance of $0.6 million.

The increase in interest expense was due
primarily to the increase in the outstanding balance under our
unsecured credit facility. The increase in depreciation expense
was primarily due to lower than normal depreciation expense in
1999 and increases in our investments in real estate. Under the
required accounting for assets held for sale, we discontinued
depreciation of a substantial portion of our retail portfolio
after we committed to dispose of a portion of the portfolio in
March 1999. The decrease in general and administrative expenses
was due to increased allocations to AMB Investment Management,
Inc. (predecessor-in-interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC),
partially offset by increased personnel costs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We currently expect that our principal sources of
working capital and funding for acquisitions, development,
expansion, and renovation of properties will include:
(1) cash flow from operations; (2) borrowings under
our unsecured credit facility; (3) other forms of secured
or unsecured financing; (4) proceeds from equity or debt
offerings by us or the operating partnership (including
issuances of limited partnership units in the operating
partnership or its subsidiaries); and (5) net proceeds from
divestitures of properties. Additionally, we believe that our
private capital co-investment program will also continue to
serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and developments.
We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our
cash flow



from operations and borrowings available under
our unsecured credit facility, and our ability to access private
and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet
our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.

Capital Resources

Property Divestitures.

In 2001, we divested ourselves of 24
industrial and two retail buildings for an aggregate price of
$193.4 million, with a resulting net gain of
$24.1 million, net of minority interest partners’
share.

Properties Held for Divestiture.

We have decided to divest ourselves of
three industrial properties and seven retail centers, which are
not in our core markets or which do not meet our strategic
objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to
negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions.
As of December 31, 2001, the net carrying value of the
properties held for divestiture was $157.2 million.

Co-investment Joint Ventures.

We consolidate the financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows of our five co-investment
joint ventures. We consolidate these joint ventures for
financial reporting purposes because we are the sole managing
general partner and, as a result, control all of the major
operating decisions. Third-party equity interests in the joint
ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated
financial statements. As of December 31, 2001, we owned
approximately 26.9 million square feet of our properties
through these entities. We may make additional investments
through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future
and presently plan to do so. The inability to obtain new joint
venture partners could adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends
on, and the market price of, our stock.

During 2001, we contributed $539.2 million
in operating properties, consisting of 111 industrial buildings
aggregating approximately 10.8 million square feet, to
three of our co-investment joint ventures. We recognized a gain
of $17.8 million related to these contributions,
representing the portion of the contributed properties acquired
by the third party co-investors.

We formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II,
L.P. to acquire, develop, and redevelop distribution facilities
nationwide, in which AMB Institutional Alliance REIT II, Inc.
became a partner on June 28, 2001. As of December 31,
2001, the Alliance Fund II had received total equity commitments
from third party investors of $195.4 million, which, when
combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment,
creates a total planned capitalization of $488.6 million. We are
the managing general partner of the Alliance Fund II and owned,
as of December 31, 2001, approximately 20% of the
co-investment joint venture.

We formed AMB-SGP, L.P. with a subsidiary of GIC
Real Estate Pte Ltd., the real estate investment subsidiary of
the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, to own and
operate, through a private real estate investment trust,
distribution facilities nationwide. On March 23, 2001,
AMB-SGP, L.P. received an equity contribution from GIC of
$75.0 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt
financings and our investment, creates a total planned
capitalization of $335.0 million. We are the managing
general partner of AMB-SGP, L.P. and owned, as of
December 31, 2001, approximately 50.3% of the co-investment
joint venture.

We formed AMB Partners II, L.P. with the City and
County of San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System to
acquire, develop, and redevelop distribution facilities
nationwide. On February 14, 2001, Partners II received an
equity contribution from CCSFERS of $50.0 million, which,
when combined with anticipated debt financings and our
investment, creates a total planned capitalization of
$250.0 million. We are the managing general partner of
Partners II and owned, as of December 31, 2001,
approximately 50% of the co-investment joint venture.

The operating partnership, together with one of
our other affiliates, owns, as of December 31, 2001,
approximately 21% of the partnership interests in AMB
Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P. The Alliance Fund I is a
co-investment partnership between the operating partnership and
AMB Institutional Alliance REIT I, Inc., which includes 15
institutional investors as stockholders, and is engaged in the
acquisition, ownership, operation, management, renovation,
expansion, and development of industrial buildings in target
markets



nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, the
Alliance Fund I had received equity contributions from third
party investors totaling $169.0 million, which, when combined
with debt financings and our investment, creates a total
capitalization of $378.0 million.

The operating partnership, together with one of
our other affiliates, owns, as of December 31, 2001,
approximately 50% of the partnership interests in AMB/ Erie.
L.P. Erie is a co-investment partnership between the operating
partnership and various entities related to Erie Indemnity
Company, and is engaged in the acquisition, ownership,
operation, management, renovation, expansion, and development of
industrial buildings in target markets nationwide. As of
December 31, 2001, Erie had received equity contributions
from third party investors totaling $13.7 million, which,
when combined with debt financings and our investment, created a
total capitalization of $129.0 million.

Credit Facilities.

In May 2000, the operating partnership
entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit
agreement. We guarantee the operating partnership’s
obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility
matures in May 2003, has a one-year extension option, and is
subject to a 15 basis point annual facility fee, which is based
on our credit rating. The operating partnership has the ability
to increase available borrowings to $700.0 million by
adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the
agreement of existing banks to increase its commitments. We use
our unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions and
for general working capital requirements. Borrowings under our
credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis
points, which is based on our credit rating. Increases in
interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our interest
expense, which would adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends
on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly, in the
future, we may engage in transactions to limit our exposure to
rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, there was
an outstanding balance of $12.0 million on our unsecured
credit facility. Monthly debt service payments on our credit
facility are interest only. The total amount available under our
credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as
defined in the agreement governing the credit facility. At
December 31, 2001, the remaining amount available under our
unsecured credit facility was $488.0 million (excluding the
additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity).

In July 2001, the Alliance Fund II obtained a
$150.0 million credit facility from Bank of America N.A.
Borrowings currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis
points. As of December 31, 2001, the outstanding balance
was $123.5 million and the remaining amount available was
$26.5 million. The credit facility is secured by the
unfunded capital commitments of the third party investors in the
Alliance REIT II and the Alliance Fund II.

Equity.

In December
2001, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries,
repurchased all of its outstanding 2,200,000 8.75% Series C
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from
three institutional investors. The units were redeemed for an
aggregate cost of $115.7 million, including accrued and
unpaid dividends totaling $1.3 million and a premium of
$4.4 million. The Series C Preferred Units had a par
value of $110.0 million.

In September 2001, the operating partnership
issued and sold 800,000 7.95% Series J Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of
$50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions are
cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in
arrears. The Series J Preferred Units are redeemable by the
operating partnership on or after September 21, 2006,
subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price
equal to $50.00 per unit, plus accumulated and unpaid
distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The
Series J Preferred Units are exchangeable, at specified
times and subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis,
for shares of our Series J Preferred Stock. The operating
partnership used the net proceeds of $38.9 million for
general corporate purposes, which may include the partial
repayment of indebtedness or the acquisition or development of
additional properties.

In March 2001, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our
subsidiaries, issued and sold 510,000 8.00% Series I
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a
price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions
are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly
in arrears at a rate per unit equal to $4.00 per annum. The
Series I Preferred Units are redeemable by AMB Property II,
L.P. on or after March 21, 2006, subject to certain
conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per
unit,



plus accumulated and unpaid distributions
thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The Series I
Preferred Units are exchangeable, at specified times and subject
to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis, for shares of our
Series I Preferred Stock. AMB Property II, L.P. used the
net proceeds of $24.9 million to repay advances from the
operating partnership and to make a loan to the operating
partnership. The operating partnership used the funds to
partially repay borrowings under its unsecured credit facility
and for general corporate purposes. The loan bears interest at
8.0% per annum and is payable on demand.

During 2001, we redeemed 223,092 and 635,798
common limited partnership units of the operating partnership
for cash and shares of our common stock, respectively.

Our board of directors approved a stock
repurchase program in 1999 for the repurchase of up to
$100.0 million worth of our common stock. During 2001, we
repurchased 1,392,600 shares of our common stock at an average
purchase price of $23.62 per share under the program. Under the
program to date, we have repurchased 2,836,200 shares our common
stock at an average purchase price of $21.22 per share. Our
stock repurchase program expired in December 2001. Our board of
directors approved a new stock repurchase program for the
repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common
stock. The new stock repurchase program expires in December 2003
and no repurchases were made under the new program in 2001.

Debt.

As of
December 31, 2001, the aggregate principal amount of our
secured debt was $1.2 billion, excluding unamortized debt
premiums of $6.8 million. The secured debt bears interest at
rates varying from 4.0% to 10.6% per annum (with a weighted
average rate of 7.3%) and final maturity dates ranging from
February 2002 to June 2023. All of the secured debt bears
interest at fixed rates, except for three loans with an
aggregate principal amount of $52.4 million as of
December 31, 2001, which bear interest at variable rates
(with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% at
December 31, 2001).

In August 2000, the operating partnership
commenced a medium-term note program for the issuance of up to
$400.0 million in principal amount of medium-term notes,
which will be guaranteed by us. As of December 31, 2001,
the operating partnership had issued $380.0 million of
medium-term notes under this program, leaving $20.0 million
available for issuance. However, on January 14, 2002, the
operating partnership issued and sold the remaining $20.0
million of the notes under this program to Lehman Brothers,
Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature
on January 17, 2007, and bear interest at 5.90% per annum.
The operating partnership used the net proceeds of
$19.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially
repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional
properties. In January 2001, the operating partnership issued
and sold $25.0 million of the notes under this program to
A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed
the notes, which mature on January 30, 2006, and bear
interest at 6.90% per annum. The operating partnership used the
net proceeds of $24.9 million for general corporate purposes, to
partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop
additional properties. In March 2001, the operating partnership
issued and sold $50.0 million of the notes under this
program to First Union Securities, Inc., as principal. We have
guaranteed the notes, which mature on March 7, 2011, and
bear interest at 7.00% per annum. The operating partnership used
the net proceeds of $49.7 million for general corporate
purposes, to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and
develop additional properties. In September 2001, the operating
partnership issued and sold $25.0 million of the notes
under this program to Lehman Brothers, Inc., as principal. We
have guaranteed the notes, which mature on September 6,
2011, and bear interest at 6.75% per annum. The operating
partnership used the net proceeds of $24.8 million for
general corporate purposes and to acquire and develop additional
properties.

We guarantee the operating partnership’s
obligations with respect to the senior debt securities. If we
are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at
maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital
transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be
sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and
to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing
interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such
as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate
loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then
the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness
would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely
affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash
flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of,
our stock. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our
properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable
to meet mortgage payments,



then the property could be foreclosed upon or
transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income
and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties
could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the
market price of, our stock.

Mortgage Receivables.

In September 2000, we sold our retail
center located in Los Angeles, California. As of
December 31, 2001, we carried a 9.50% mortgage note in the
principal amount of $74.0 million on the retail center. The
maturity date of the mortgage note, which was originally
scheduled to mature on October 1, 2001, has been extended
to September 30, 2002. Through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
we also hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an
unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0%
and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2001, the
outstanding balance on the note was $13.2 million.

In order to maintain financial flexibility and
facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we
presently intend to operate with a debt-to-total market
capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. At
December 31, 2001, our debt-to-total market capitalization
ratio was 44.7%. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our
capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating
on our senior unsecured debt. In spite of these policies, our
organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the
amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board
of directors could alter or eliminate these policies or
circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply
with these policies.

The tables below summarize our debt maturities
and capitalization as of December 31, 2001:

Debt

The 2003 maturity includes a $125.0 million

	expect to repay with capital contributions and secured debt
	proceeds and had an outstanding balance of $123.5 million
	at December 31, 2001. The operating partnership also has a
	$500.0 million credit facility that had an outstanding
	balance of $12.0 million at December 31, 2001.

The weighted average interest and maturity for
	the unconsolidated joint venture debt were 6.3% and
	7.0 years, respectively.

Liquidity

As of December 31, 2001, we had
approximately $81.7 million in cash, restricted cash, and
cash equivalents, and $488.0 million of additional
available borrowings under our credit facility. We also had
$26.5 million of additional available borrowing under our
Alliance Fund II credit facility. To fund acquisitions,
development activities, and capital expenditures and to provide
for general working capital requirements, we intend to use:
(1) cash from operations; (2) borrowings under our
credit facility; (3) other forms of secured and unsecured
financing; (4) proceeds from any future debt or equity
offerings by us or the operating partnership (including
issuances of limited partnership units in the operating
partnership or its subsidiaries); (5) proceeds from
divestitures of properties; and (6) private capital. The
unavailability of capital would adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay
dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.



Our board of directors declared a regular cash
dividend for the quarter ending December 31, 2001, of
$0.395 per share of common stock and the operating partnership
declared a regular cash distribution for the quarter ending
December 31, 2001, of $0.395 per common unit. The dividends
and distributions were payable on December 24, 2001, to
stockholders and unitholders of record on December 14,
2001. The Series A, B, E, F, G, and J preferred stock and
unit dividends and distributions were also payable on
January 15, 2002, to stockholders and unitholders of record
on January 4, 2002. The Series D, H, and I preferred
unit distributions were payable on December 25, 2001, to
unitholders of record on December 10, 2001. The following
table sets forth the dividend payments and distributions for
2001 and 2000:

The anticipated size of our distributions, using
only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of
our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay
maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity
financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may
not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at
all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable
terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends
on, and the market price of, our stock.

Capital Commitments

Developments.

In
addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of
building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or
re-tenant space, as of December 31, 2001, we are developing
12 projects representing a total estimated investment of
$154.4 million upon completion and two development projects
available for sale representing a total estimated investment of
$50.0 million upon completion. Of this total,
$127.3 million had been funded as of December 31,
2001, and an estimated $77.1 million is required to
complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these
expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our
credit facility, debt or equity issuances, and net proceeds from
property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our
cash flow. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable
terms for development projects and we may not complete
construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in
increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays
in leasing such properties and generating cash flow. This could
adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price
of, our stock. We have no other material capital commitments.

Acquisitions.

During
2001, we invested $428.3 million in 65 operating industrial
buildings, aggregating approximately 6.8 million rentable
square feet. We funded these acquisitions and initiated
development and renovation projects through private capital
contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt
and equity issuances, and net proceeds from property
divestitures.



Lease Commitments.

We have entered into operating ground
leases on certain land parcels with periods up to 40 years
and a lease on a building in New York City. Future minimum
rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases
in effect as of December 31, 2001, were as follows (dollars
in thousands):

These operating lease payments are being
amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases.

Captive Insurance Company.

We have responded to recent trends
towards increasing costs and decreasing coverage availability in
the insurance markets by obtaining higher-deductible property
insurance from third party insurers and by forming a
wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata National
Insurance Ltd. in December 2001. Arcata will generally provide
insurance coverage for losses below the increased deductible
under the third party policies. Premiums paid to Arcata have a
retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses,
are less than premiums collected, the excess will be returned to
the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the
customers) and conversely, if expenses, including losses, are
greater than premiums collected, an additional premium, not in
excess of the difference, will be charged. Through this
structure, we believe that we have been able to obtain insurance
for our portfolio with more comprehensive coverage at a
projected overall lower cost than would otherwise be available
in the market.

Potential Unknown Liabilities.

Unknown liabilities may include the
following: (1) liabilities for clean-up or remediation of
undisclosed environmental conditions; (2) claims of
customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with our
predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not
been asserted prior to our formation transactions;
(3) accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business; (4) tax liabilities; and
(5) claims for indemnification by the officers and
directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these
entities.

Funds From
Operations

We believe that funds from operations, or FFO, as
defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts, is an appropriate measure of performance for a real
estate investment trust. While funds from operations is a
relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of
real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow
from operations or net income as defined by generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States and it should not be
considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating
liquidity or operating performance. Further, funds from
operations as disclosed by other real estate investment trusts
may not be comparable.

FFO is defined as income from operations before
minority interest, gains or losses from sale of real estate, and
extraordinary items plus real estate depreciation and adjustment
to derive our pro rata share of FFO of unconsolidated joint
ventures, less minority interests’ pro rata share of FFO of
consolidated joint ventures and perpetual preferred stock
dividends. In accordance with the NAREIT White Paper on funds
from operations, we include the effects of straight-line rents
in funds from operations. Further, we do not adjust FFO to
eliminate the effects of non-recurring charges.



The following table reflects the calculation of
funds from operations for the years ended December 31,
(dollars in thousands):

(1)

Ground lease amortization represents the
	amortization of our investments in ground lease properties, for
	which we do not have a purchase option.

(2)

Represents FFO attributable to minority interests
	in consolidated joint ventures whose interests are not
	exchangeable into common stock. The minority interests’
	share of net operating income for the years ended
	December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $65.0 million,
	$25.0 million, and $12.5 million, respectively.

(3)

Our share of net operating income for years ended
	December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $10.2 million,
	$8.3 million, and $8.0 million, respectively.

BUSINESS RISKS

Our operations involve various risks that could
have adverse consequences to us. These risks include, among
others:

General Real Estate Risks

There Are Factors Outside of Our Control
	that Affect the Performance and Value of Our
	Properties

Real property investments are subject to varying
degrees of risk. The yields available from equity investments in
real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital
appreciation generated by the related properties as well as the
expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our
properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating
expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then
our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be
adversely affected. Income from, and the value of, our
properties may be adversely affected by the general economic
climate, local conditions such as oversupply of industrial
space, or a reduction in demand for industrial space, the
attractiveness of our properties to potential customers,
competition from other properties, our ability to provide
adequate maintenance and insurance, and an increase in operating
costs. Periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United
States and in other countries, rising interest rates, or
declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any
of these events may occur would result in a general decrease in
rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing
leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.

Future terrorist attacks in the United States may
result in declining economic activity, which could harm the
demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that
our customers are impacted by future attacks, their businesses
similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability
to continue to honor their existing leases. Our properties are
currently concentrated predominantly in the industrial real
estate sector. Our concentration in a certain property type
exposes us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a



greater extent than if our portfolio also
included other property types. As a result of such
concentration, economic downturns in the industrial real estate
sector could adversely affect our financial condition, results
of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and
the market price of, our stock. In addition, revenues from
properties and real estate values are also affected by factors
such as the cost of compliance with regulations, the potential
for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax
laws), interest rate levels, and the availability of financing.
Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number
of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to
rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain
significant expenditures associated with an investment in real
estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and
maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances
cause a reduction in income from the property.

We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet
	Space as Leases Expire

We are subject to the risks that leases may not
be renewed, space may not be relet, or the terms of renewal or
reletting (including the cost of required renovations) may be
less favorable than current lease terms. Leases on a total of
14.9% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base
rent) as of December 31, 2001, will expire on or prior to
December 31, 2002. In addition, numerous properties compete
with our properties in attracting customers to lease space,
particularly with respect to retail centers. The number of
competitive commercial properties in a particular area could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space in
our properties and on the rents that we are able to charge. Our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our
ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock
could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet
or renew the leases for all or a substantial portion of expiring
leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting is
significantly lower than expected, or if our reserves for these
purposes prove inadequate.

Real Estate Investments are
	Illiquid

Because real estate investments are relatively
illiquid, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response
to economic or other conditions is limited. The limitations in
the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations on a real
estate investment trust holding property for sale may affect our
ability to sell properties without adversely affecting dividends
to our stockholders. The relative illiquidity of our holdings
and Internal Revenue Code prohibitions and related regulations
could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the
performance of our investments and could adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our
ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

A Significant Number of Our Properties Are
	Located in California

Our industrial properties located in California
as of December 31, 2001, represented approximately 28.7% of
the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating
properties as of December 31, 2001, and 35.9% of our
annualized base rent. Annualized base rent means the monthly
contractual amount under existing leases as of December 31,
2001, multiplied by 12. This amount excludes expense
reimbursements and rental abatements. Our revenue from, and the
value of, our properties located in California may be affected
by a number of factors, including local real estate conditions
(such as oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial
properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs,
downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other
factors may adversely impact the local economic climate. A
downturn in either the California economy or in California real
estate conditions could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to
pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Certain of
our properties are also subject to possible loss from seismic
activity.

Some Potential Losses Are not Covered by
Insurance

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended
coverage, and rental loss insurance covering all of our
properties, with policy specifications and insured limits that
we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances
given relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage, and
industry practice. There are, however, certain losses that are
not generally insured because it is not economically feasible to
insure against them,



including losses due to acts of terrorism, riots
or acts of war. Certain losses such as losses due to floods or
seismic activity may be insured subject to certain limitations
including large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits. If
an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs
with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could
lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the
anticipated future revenue from the properties and, in the case
of debt, which is with recourse to us, we would remain obligated
for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to
the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the
operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of
the operating partnership’s unsatisfied obligations other
than non-recourse obligations, including any obligations
incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of
the co-investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could
adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price
of, our stock.

A number of our properties are located in areas
that are known to be subject to earthquake activity, including
California where, as of December 31, 2001, 291 industrial
buildings aggregating approximately 23.4 million square
feet (representing 28.7% of our industrial operating properties
based on aggregate square footage and 35.9% based on annualized
base rent) are located. We carry replacement cost earthquake
insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically
subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and
deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. This
insurance coverage also applies to the properties managed by AMB
Capital Partners, LLC, with a single aggregate policy limit and
deductible applicable to those properties and our properties.
Through an annual analysis prepared by outside consultants, we
evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage in light of current
industry practice and determine the appropriate amount of
earthquake insurance to carry. We may incur material losses in
excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue
to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates.

We Are Subject to Risks and Liabilities In
Connection With Properties Owned Through Joint Ventures, Limited
Liability Companies, and Partnerships

As of December 31, 2001, we had ownership
interests in several joint ventures, limited liability
companies, or partnerships with third parties, as well as
interests in three unconsolidated entities. As of
December 31, 2001, we owned approximately 34.1 million
square feet (excluding three unconsolidated joint ventures) of
our properties through these entities. We may make additional
investments through these ventures in the future and presently
plan to do so. Such partners may share certain approval rights
over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company, or
joint venture investments may involve risks such as the
following: (1) our partners, co-members, or joint venturers
might become bankrupt (in which event we and any other remaining
general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally
remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited
liability company, or joint venture); (2) our partners,
co-members, or joint venturers might at any time have economic
or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with
our business interests or goals; (3) our partners,
co-members, or joint venturers may be in a position to take
action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or
objectives, including our current policy with respect to
maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust;
and (4) agreements governing joint ventures, limited
liability companies, and partnerships often contain restrictions
on the transfer of a joint venturer’s, member’s, or
partner’s interest or “buy-sell” or other
provisions, which may result in a purchase or sale of the
interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms.

We will, however, generally seek to maintain
sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability
companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our
business objectives. Our organizational documents do not limit
the amount of available funds that we may invest in
partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint ventures.
The occurrence of one or more of the events described above
could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the
market price of, our stock.

We May be Unable to Consummate Acquisitions on
Advantageous Terms

We intend to continue to acquire primarily
industrial properties. Acquisitions of properties entail risks
that investments will fail to perform in accordance with
expectations. Estimates of the costs of improvements



necessary for us to bring an acquired property up
to market standards may prove inaccurate. In addition, there are
general investment risks associated with any real estate
investment. Further, we anticipate significant competition for
attractive investment opportunities from other major real estate
investors with significant capital including both publicly
traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional
investment funds. We expect that future acquisitions will be
financed through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured
credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or
the operating partnership (including issuances of limited
partnership units by the operating partnership or its
subsidiaries), and proceeds from property divestitures, which
could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. We may not be
able to acquire additional properties. Our inability to finance
any future acquisitions on favorable terms or the failure of
acquisitions to conform with our expectations or investment
criteria, or our failure to timely reinvest the proceeds from
property divestitures could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay
dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

We May be Unable to Complete Renovation and
Development on Advantageous Terms

The real estate development business, including
the renovation and rehabilitation of existing properties,
involves significant risks. These risks include the following:
(1) we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable
terms for development projects and we may not complete
construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in
increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays
in leasing such properties and generating cash flow; (2) we
may not be able to obtain, or we may experience delays in
obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy,
and other required governmental permits and authorizations;
(3) new or renovated properties may perform below
anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts;
(4) substantial renovation as well as new development
activities, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately
successful, typically require a substantial portion of
management’s time and attention that could divert
management’s time from our day-to-day operations; and
(5) activities that we finance through construction loans
involve the risk that, upon completion of construction, we may
not be able to obtain permanent financing or we may not be able
to obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms. These risks
could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the
market price of, our stock.

We May be Unable to Complete Divestitures on
Advantageous Terms

We have decided to divest ourselves of four
retail centers and one industrial property, which are not in our
core markets or which do not meet our strategic objectives. The
divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of
acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Our ability to
dispose of properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon
factors beyond our control, including competition from other
owners (including other real estate investment trusts) that are
attempting to dispose of industrial and retail properties and
the availability of financing on attractive terms for potential
buyers of our properties. Our inability to dispose of properties
on favorable terms or our inability to redeploy the proceeds of
property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy
could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the
market price of, our stock.

Debt Financing

We Could Incur More Debt

We operate with a policy of incurring debt,
either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if upon such
incurrence our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio would
be approximately 45% or less. The aggregate amount of
indebtedness that we may incur under our policy varies directly
with the valuation of our capital stock and the number of shares
of capital stock outstanding. Accordingly, we would be able to
incur additional indebtedness under our policy as a result of
increases in the market price per share of our common stock or
other outstanding classes of capital stock, and future issuance
of shares of our capital stock. However, our organizational
documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of
indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of
directors could alter or eliminate this policy. If we change
this policy, then we could



become more highly leveraged, resulting in an
increase in debt service that could adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and
ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely
	Affect Our Financial Condition

We are subject to risks normally associated with
debt financing, including the risks that cash flow will be
insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders, that we will
be unable to refinance existing indebtedness on our properties
(which in all cases will not have been fully amortized at
maturity) and that the terms of refinancing will not be as
favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. As of
December 31, 2001, we had total debt outstanding of
approximately $2.1 billion.

In addition, we guarantee the operating
partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior debt
securities referenced in our financial statements. If we are
unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity
or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we
expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to
pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing
debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors
at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to
make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest
rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to
that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased
interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends
on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, if we
mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of
indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then
the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the
mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A
foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely
affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash
flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of,
our stock.

Rising Interest Rates Could Adversely
	Affect Our Cash Flow

As of December 31, 2001, we had
$123.5 million outstanding under our Alliance Fund II
secured credit facility, $12.0 million outstanding under
our unsecured credit facility, and we had four secured loans
with an aggregate principal amount of $52.4 million, which
bear interest at variable rates (with weighted average interest
rate of 3.8% as of December 31, 2001). In addition, we may
incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future. Increases
in interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our
interest expense, which would adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay
dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly,
in the future, we may engage in transactions to limit our
exposure to rising interest rates.

We Are Dependent on External Sources of
	Capital

In order to qualify as a real estate investment
trust under the Internal Revenue Code, we are required each year
to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real
estate investment trust taxable income (determined without
regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net
capital gain) and we are subject to tax on our income to the
extent it is not distributed. Because of this distribution
requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital
needs, including capital needs in connection with acquisitions,
from cash retained from operations. As a result, to fund capital
needs, we rely on third party sources of capital, which we may
not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all. Our access
to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of
factors, including: (1) general market conditions;
(2) the market’s perception of our growth potential;
(3) our current and potential future earnings and cash
distributions; and (4) the market price of our capital
stock. Additional debt financing may substantially increase our
debt-to-total capitalization ratio.

We Could Default on Cross-Collateralized
	and Cross-Defaulted Debt

As of December 31, 2001, we had 22
non-recourse secured loans, which are cross collateralized by 48
properties. As of December 31, 2001, we had $551.9 million
(not including unamortized debt premium) outstanding on these
loans. If we default on any of these loans, then we could be
required to repay the



aggregate of all indebtedness, together with
applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the
cross-collateralized properties within the applicable pool.
Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our
loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay
dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition,
our credit facilities and the senior debt securities of the
operating partnership contain certain cross-default provisions,
which are triggered in the event that our other material
indebtedness is in default. These cross-default provisions may
require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the
senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt
that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay
dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

Contingent or Unknown Liabilities Could
Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition

Our predecessors have been in existence for
varying lengths of time up to 18 years. At the time of our
formation we acquired the assets of these entities subject to
all of their potential existing liabilities. There may be
current liabilities or future liabilities arising from prior
activities that we are not aware of and therefore have not
disclosed in this report. We assumed these liabilities as the
surviving entity in the various merger and contribution
transactions that occurred at the time of our formation.
Existing liabilities for indebtedness generally were taken into
account in connection with the allocation of the operating
partnership’s limited partnership units or shares of our
common stock in the formation transactions, but no other
liabilities were taken into account for these purposes. We do
not have recourse against our predecessors or any of their
respective stockholders or partners or against any individual
account investors with respect to any unknown liabilities.
Unknown liabilities might include the following: (1) liabilities
for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental
conditions; (2) claims of customers, vendors, or other
persons dealing with our predecessors prior to the formation
transactions that had not been asserted prior to the formation
transactions; (3) accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred
in the ordinary course of business; (4) tax liabilities;
and (5) claims for indemnification by the officers and
directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these
entities.

Certain customers may claim that the formation
transactions gave rise to a right to purchase the premises that
they occupy. We do not believe any such claims would be material
and, to date, no such claims have been filed. See
“— Government Regulations — We Could
Encounter Costly Environmental Problems” below regarding
the possibility of undisclosed environmental conditions
potentially affecting the value of our properties. Undisclosed
material liabilities in connection with the acquisition of
properties, entities and interests in properties, or entities
could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the
market price of, our stock.

Our Access to Timely Financial Reporting and
to Capital Markets May be Impaired if Arthur Andersen LLP is
Unable to Perform Required Audit-Related Services

On March 14, 2002, our independent public
accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP, was indicted on federal
obstruction of justice charges arising from the U.S.
government’s investigation of Enron Corporation. Arthur
Andersen LLP has indicated that it intends to contest vigorously
the indictment. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said
that it will continue accepting financial statements audited by
Arthur Andersen LLP, and interim financial statements reviewed
by it, so long as Arthur Andersen LLP is able to make certain
representations to its clients. Our access to the capital
markets and our ability to make timely filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission could be impaired if the
Securities and Exchange Commission ceases accepting financial
statements audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, if Arthur Andersen
LLP becomes unable to make the required representations to us or
if for any other reason Arthur Andersen LLP is unable to perform
required audit-related services for us. However, we believe that
our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from
operations and borrowings available under our unsecured credit
facility, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements
for the foreseeable future.



Conflicts of Interest

Some of Our Directors and Executive
	Officers Are Involved in Other Real Estate Activities and
	Investments

Some of our executive officers own interests in
real estate-related businesses and investments. These interests
include minority ownership of Institutional Housing Partners,
L.P., a residential housing finance company, and ownership of
Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P.,
developers that own property not suitable for ownership by us.
Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P. have
agreed not to initiate any new development projects not
contemplated at our initial public offering in November 1997.
These entities have also agreed that they will not make any
further investments in industrial properties other than those
currently under development at the time of our initial public
offering. The continued involvement in other real estate-related
activities by some of our executive officers and directors could
divert management’s attention from our day-to-day
operations. Most of our executive officers have entered into
non-competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have
agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly,
in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any
investment in respect of industrial real estate, other than
through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares
of a public company engaged in such activities or through the
existing investments referred to in this report. State law may
limit our ability to enforce these agreements.

Certain of Our Executive Officers and
	Directors May Have Conflicts of Interest with Us in Connection
	with Other Properties that They Own or Control

As of December 31, 2001, Aspire Development,
L.P. owns interests in three retail development projects in the
U.S., one of which is a single freestanding Walgreens drugstore
and two of which are Walgreens drugstores plus shop buildings,
which are less than 10,000 feet. In addition,
Messrs. Moghadam and Burke, each a founder and director,
own less than 1% interests in two partnerships that own office
buildings in various markets; these interests have negligible
value. Luis A. Belmonte, an executive officer, owns less than a
10% interest, representing an estimated value of $150,000, in a
limited partnership, which owns an office building located in
Oakland, California.

In addition, several of our executive officers
individually own: (1) less than 1% interests in the stocks
of certain publicly-traded real estate investment trusts;
(2) certain interests in and rights to developed and
undeveloped real property located outside the United States; and
(3) certain other de minimus holdings in equity securities
of real estate companies.

Thomas W. Tusher, a member of our board of
directors, is a limited partner in a partnership in which
Messrs. Moghadam and Burke are general partners and which
owns a 75% interest in an office building. Mr. Tusher owns
a 20% interest in the partnership, valued at approximately
$1.7 million. Messrs. Moghadam and Burke each have a
26.7% interest in the partnership, each valued at approximately
$2.2 million.

We believe that the properties and activities set
forth above generally do not directly compete with any of our
properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an
executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive
officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the
future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in
close proximity to that property. In addition, the continued
involvement by our executive officers and directors in these
properties could divert management’s attention from our
day-to-day operations. Our policy prohibits us from acquiring
any properties from our executive officers or their affiliates
without the approval of the disinterested members of our board
of directors with respect to that transaction.

Our Role as General Partner of the
	Operating Partnership May Conflict with the Interests of
	Stockholders

As the general partner of the operating
partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating
partnership’s limited partners, the discharge of which may
conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition,
those persons holding limited partnership units will have the
right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the
partnership agreement of the operating partnership and
individually to approve certain



amendments that would adversely affect their
rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in
a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders.
In addition, under the terms of the operating partnership’s
partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will
have certain approval rights with respect to certain
transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not
exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all
stockholders.

Our Directors, Executive Officers, and
	Significant Stockholders Could Act in a Manner that is Not in
	the Best Interest of All Stockholders

As of March 20, 2002, we believe that our
two largest stockholders, Cohen & Steers Capital Management,
Inc. (with respect to various client accounts for which Cohen
& Steers Capital Management, Inc. serves as investment
advisor) and ABP Investments U.S. (with respect to various
client accounts for which ABP Investments U.S. serves as
investment advisor) beneficially owned 14.0% of our outstanding
common stock. In addition, our executive officers and directors
beneficially owned 4.3% of our outstanding common stock as of
March 20, 2002, and will have influence on our management
and operation and, as stockholders, will have influence on the
outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.
This influence might be exercised in a manner that is
inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders. Although
there is no understanding or arrangement for these directors,
officers, and stockholders and their affiliates to act in
concert, these parties would be in a position to exercise
significant influence over our affairs if they choose to do so.

Government Regulations

Many laws and governmental regulations are
applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and
regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts,
occur frequently.

Costs of Compliance with Americans with
	Disabilities Act

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places
of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements
related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with
the Americans with Disabilities Act might require us to remove
structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public
areas where such removal is “readily achievable.” If
we fail to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then
we might be required to pay fines to the government or damages
to private litigants. The impact of application of the Americans
with Disabilities Act to our properties, including the extent
and timing of required renovations, is uncertain. If we are
required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act, then our cash flow and the
amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be
adversely affected.

We Could Encounter Environmental
	Problems

Federal, state, and local laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment impose liability
on a current or previous owner or operator of real estate for
contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of
hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the
property. A current or previous owner may be required to
investigate and clean up contamination at or migrating from a
site. These laws typically impose liability and clean-up
responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator
knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more
than one person may have been responsible for the contamination,
each person covered by the environmental laws may be held
responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition,
third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for
damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other
costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting
from environmental contamination present at or emanating from
that site.

Environmental laws also govern the presence,
maintenance, and removal of asbestos. These laws require that
owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly
manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or
train those who may come into contact with asbestos, and that
they undertake special precautions, including removal or other
abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during
renovation or



demolition of a building. These laws may impose
fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failing
to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to
seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury
associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. Some of our
properties may contain asbestos-containing building materials.

Some of our properties are leased or have been
leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use,
store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous
or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the
release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic
substances. Some of our properties are adjacent to or near other
properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum
products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition,
certain of our properties are on, are adjacent to, or are near
other properties upon which others, including former owners or
customers of the properties, have engaged or may in the future
engage in activities that may release petroleum products or
other hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may
acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known
adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the
environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are
quantifiable and the acquisition will yield a superior
risk-adjusted return. Environmental issues for each property are
evaluated and quantified prior to acquisition. The costs of
environmental investigation, clean-up, and monitoring are
underwritten into the cost of the acquisition and appropriate
environmental insurance is obtained for the property. In
connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to
remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or
monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.

All of our properties were subject to a Phase I
or similar environmental assessments by independent
environmental consultants at the time of acquisition. Phase I
assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information
regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property
and surrounding properties and include an historical review, a
public records review, an investigation of the surveyed site and
surrounding properties, and preparation and issuance of a
written report. We may perform additional Phase II testing if
recommended by the independent environmental consultant. Phase
II testing may include the collection and laboratory analysis of
soil and groundwater samples, completion of surveys for
asbestos-containing building materials, and any other testing
that the consultant considers prudent in order to test for the
presence of hazardous materials.

None of the environmental assessments of our
properties has revealed any environmental liability that we
believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
Furthermore, we are not aware of any such material environmental
liability. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments do
not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are
material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware or
that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities
that are materially greater than anticipated. Moreover, the
current environmental condition of our properties may be
affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the
vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground
storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us. If the
costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws
and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and
ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock
could be adversely affected.

Our Financial Condition Could be Adversely
	Affected if We Fail to Comply with Other
	Regulations

Our properties are also subject to various
federal, state, and local regulatory requirements such as state
and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to
comply with these requirements, then we might incur fines by
governmental authorities or be required to pay awards of damages
to private litigants. We believe that our properties are
currently in substantial compliance with all such regulatory
requirements. However, these requirements may change or new
requirements may be imposed, which could require significant
unanticipated expenditures by us. Any such unanticipated
expenditure could adversely affect our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends
on, and the market price of, our stock.



Federal Income Tax Risks

Our Failure to Qualify as a Real Estate
	Investment Trust Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to
	Stockholders

We elected to be taxed as a real estate
investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal
Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended
December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to
qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal
Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and
method of operation comply with the rules and regulations
promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to
continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However,
it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a
manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate
investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us
to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment
trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an
annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly
technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which
there are only limited judicial and administrative
interpretations, and involves the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our
control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate
investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross
income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must
pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90%
of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined
without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding
capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a
quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury
regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our
assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new
regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions
could significantly change the tax laws with respect to
qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal
income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are
not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely
affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust.

If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment
trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay
federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum
tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we
are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we
would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment
trust for the four taxable years following the year during which
we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment
trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or
distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for
each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be
required to make distributions to our stockholders.

We Pay Some
Taxes

Even if we qualify as a real estate investment
trust, we will be required to pay certain state and local taxes
on our income and property. In addition, we will be required to
pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income, if
any, from the activities conducted through AMB Capital Partners,
LLC and Headlands Realty Corporation. AMB Capital Partners, LLC
and Headlands Realty Corporation, as taxable REIT subsidiaries,
are also subject to tax on their income, reducing their cash
available for distribution to us.

Certain Property Transfers May Generate
	Prohibited Transaction Income

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise
dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue
Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we
hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the
ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a
prohibited transaction. We would be required to pay a 100%
penalty tax on that income. Since we acquire properties for
investment purposes, we believe that any transfer or disposal of
property by us would not be deemed by the Internal Revenue
Service to be a prohibited transaction with any resulting gain
allocable to us being subject to a 100% penalty tax. However,
whether property is held for investment purposes is a question
of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances
surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue
Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of
properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe
that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such
dispute, if the IRS were to successfully argue that a transfer
or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction,
then we would be required to pay



a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us
from the prohibited transaction. In addition, any income from a
prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to
satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate
investment trust for federal income tax purposes.

We Are Dependent On Our Key
Personnel

We depend on the efforts of our executive
officers. While we believe that we could find suitable
replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services
or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and
ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.
We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive
officers.

We May Be Unable to Manage Our
Growth

Our business has grown rapidly and continues to
grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail
to effectively manage our growth, then our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends
on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely
affected.

We May Be Unable to Effectively Manage Our
International Growth

We may acquire properties in foreign countries.
Local markets affect our operations and, therefore, we would be
subject to economic fluctuations in foreign locations. Our
international operations also would be subject to the usual
risks of doing business abroad such as the revaluation of
currencies, revisions in tax treaties or other laws governing
the taxation of revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds,
and, in certain parts of the world, political instability. We
cannot predict the likelihood that any such developments may
occur. Further, we may enter into agreements with non-U.S.
entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to
dispute resolution in, the courts of another country or region.
We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide
us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes
that may arise. Even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory
decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could
have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely
basis. Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow
through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to
effectively manage our international growth, then our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay
dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be
adversely affected.

Ownership of Our Stock

Limitations in Our Charter and Bylaws Could
	Prevent a Change in Control

Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may
delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other
transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock
with the opportunity to realize a premium over the
then-prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain
our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal
income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our
outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by
five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue
Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a
taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real
estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our
common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at
least 335 days of a 12-month taxable year (or a
proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or
an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively
owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any
partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received
by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from
that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the
real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal
Revenue Code. To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as
a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes,
we will prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the
constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
by any single person of more than 9.8% (by value or number of
shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and
outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 9.8% (by
value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the
issued and outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred
Stock, and we will also prohibit the ownership, actually or
constructively, of any shares of our other preferred stock by
any single



person so that no such person, taking into
account all of our stock so owned by such person, may own in
excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We
refer to this limitation as the “ownership limit.”
Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will
be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated
charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in
violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any
dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or
receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in
excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the
amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation
of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The
ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or
preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely
affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over
the then-prevailing market price for the shares of our common
stock in connection with such transaction.

Our charter authorizes us to issue additional
shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the
preferences, rights, and other terms of any series or class of
preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors
has no intention to do so at the present time, it could
establish a series or class of preferred stock that could delay,
defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that
might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise
be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also
contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a
transaction, including a change in control, that might involve
payment of a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be
in the best interests of our stockholders. Those provisions
include the following: (1) the provision in the charter
that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a
two-thirds vote of stockholders, together with bylaw provisions
authorizing the board of directors to fill vacant directorships;
(2) the provision in the charter requiring a two-thirds vote of
stockholders for any amendment of the charter; (3) the
requirement in the bylaws that the request of the holders of 50%
or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to
call a special meeting; (4) the requirement of Maryland law
that stockholders may only take action by written consent with
the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on
the matter in question; and (5) the requirement in the
bylaws of advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of
directors or proposal of business to be considered at a meeting
of stockholders.

These provisions may impede various actions by
stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which
in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction involving a
change of control.

We Could Change Our Investment and
	Financing Policies without a Vote of Stockholders

Subject to our current investment policy to
maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust
(unless a change is approved by our board of directors under
certain circumstances), our board of directors will determine
our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and
our debt, capitalization, distribution, and operating policies.
Although the board of directors has no present intention to
revise or amend these strategies and policies, the board of
directors may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders.
Accordingly, stockholders will have no control over changes in
our strategies and policies (other than through the election of
directors), and any such changes may not serve the interests of
all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial
condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay
dividends to our stockholders.

If We Issue Additional Securities, then the
	Investment of Existing Stockholders Will Be
	Diluted

We have authority to issue shares of common stock
or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property or
otherwise. Similarly, we may cause the operating partnership to
issue additional limited partnership units in exchange for
property or otherwise. Existing stockholders will have no
preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by
us or the operating partnership and any issuance of additional
equity securities could result in dilution of an existing
stockholder’s investment.



The Large Number of Shares Available for
	Future Sale Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our
	Common Stock

We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future
sales of shares of our common stock, or the availability of
shares of our common stock for future sale, will have on its
market price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our
common stock in the public market (or upon exchange of limited
partnership units in the operating partnership) or the
perception that such sales (or exchanges) might occur could
adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

All shares of common stock issuable upon the
redemption of limited partnership units in the operating
partnership will be deemed to be “restricted
securities” within the meaning of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act and may not be transferred unless registered
under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is
available, including any exemption from registration provided
under Rule 144. In general, upon satisfaction of certain
conditions, Rule 144 permits the holder to sell certain
amounts of restricted securities one year following the date of
acquisition of the restricted securities from us and, after two
years, permits unlimited sales by persons unaffiliated with us.
Commencing generally on the first anniversary of the date of
acquisition of common limited partnership units (or such other
date agreed to by the operating partnership and the holders of
the units), the operating partnership may redeem common limited
partnership units at the request of the holders for cash (based
on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of
common stock at the time of redemption) or, at the option of the
operating partnership, exchange the common limited partnership
units for an equal number of shares of our common stock, subject
to certain antidilution adjustments. The operating partnership
had issued and outstanding 4,969,027 common limited partnership
units as of December 31, 2001. As of December 31,
2001, we had reserved 8,072,818 shares of common stock for
issuance under our Stock Option and Incentive Plan (not
including shares that we have already issued) and, as of
December 31, 2001, we had granted to certain directors,
officers, and employees options to purchase 7,437,219 shares of
common stock (excluding forfeitures and 330,176 shares that we
have issued pursuant to the exercise of options). As of
December 31, 2001, we had granted 549,738 restricted shares
of common stock, 2,732 of which have been forfeited. In
addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock and the
operating partnership may issue additional limited partnership
units in connection with the acquisition of properties. In
connection with the issuance of common limited partnership units
to other transferors of properties, and in connection with the
issuance of the performance units, we have agreed to file
registration statements covering the issuance of shares of
common stock upon the exchange of the common limited partnership
units. We have also filed a registration statement with respect
to the shares of common stock issuable under our Stock Option
and Incentive Plan. These registration statements and
registration rights generally allow shares of common stock
covered thereby, including shares of common stock issuable upon
exchange of limited partnership units, including performance
units, or the exercise of options or restricted shares of common
stock, to be transferred or resold without restriction under the
Securities Act. We may also agree to provide registration rights
to any other person who may become an owner of the operating
partnership’s limited partnership units.

Future sales of the shares of common stock
described above could adversely affect the market price of our
common stock. The existence of the operating partnership’s
limited partnership units, options, and shares of common stock
reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership
units, and the exercise of options and registration rights
referred to above, also may adversely affect the terms upon
which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale
of equity securities.

Various Market Conditions Affect the Price
	of Our Stock

As with other publicly-traded equity securities,
the market price of our stock will depend upon various market
conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market
conditions that may affect the market price of our stock are the
following: (1) the extent of investor interest in us;
(2) the general reputation of real estate investment trusts
and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison
to other equity securities (including securities issued by other
real estate-based companies); (3) our financial
performance; (4) general stock and bond market conditions,
including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities,
that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a
higher annual yield from future dividends; and



(5) terrorist activity may adversely affect the
markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing
market volatility and causing the further erosion of business
and consumer confidence and spending. Other factors such as
governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could
also have a significant impact on the future market price of our
stock.

Earnings and Cash Dividends, Asset Value,
	and Market Interest Rates Affect the Price of Our
	Stock

The market value of the equity securities of a
real estate investment trust generally is based primarily upon
the market’s perception of the real estate investment
trust’s growth potential and its current and potential
future earnings and cash dividends. It is based secondarily upon
the real estate market value of the underlying assets. For that
reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher
or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent that
we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working
capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while
increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not
correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our
failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to
future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect
the market price of our stock. Another factor that may influence
the price of our stock will be the distribution yield on the
stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to
market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates
might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a
higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect the
market price of the stock. If the market price of our stock
declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants
with respect to debt obligations, which might adversely affect
our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our
ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.

Item 7a.

Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse
changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings
and cash flows are dependent upon prevalent market rates.
Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected
cash inflows from operating, investing, and financing activities
with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions,
capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and
unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our
outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the
risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk
includes: (1) interest rate fluctuations in connection with
our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings; and
(2) our ability to incur more debt without stockholder
approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which
could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31,
2001, we had no interest rate caps or swaps. See
“Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capital
Resources — Market Capitalization.”

The table below summarizes the market risks
associated with our fixed and variable rated debt outstanding
before unamortized debt premiums of $6.8 million as of
December 31, 2001:

(1)

Represents 91.2% of all outstanding debt.

(2)

Represents 8.9% of all outstanding debt.

If market rates of interest on our variable rate
debt increased by 10% (or 30 basis points), then the
increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be
$0.6 million annually.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of AMB Property Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of AMB Property Corporation (a Maryland
corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and
2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These
consolidated financial statements and the schedule referred to
below are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of AMB Property Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming
an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
The supplemental Schedule III, Real Estate and Accumulated
Depreciation is presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and are not part
of the basic financial statements. The schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly
states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole.

AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

December 31, 2001 and 2000

1.     Organization
and Formation of the Company

AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation
(the “Company”), commenced operations as a fully
integrated real estate company effective with the completion of
its initial public offering on November 26, 1997. The
Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust
(“REIT”) under Sections 856 through 860 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), commencing
with its taxable year ended December 31, 1997, and believes
its current organization and method of operation will enable it
to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust. The
Company, through its controlling interest in its subsidiary, AMB
Property, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the
“Operating Partnership”), is engaged in the
acquisition, ownership, operation, management, renovation,
expansion, and development of industrial buildings primarily in
eight hub markets and gateway cities. Unless the context
otherwise requires, the “Company” means AMB Property
Corporation, the Operating Partnership, and its other controlled
subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned
an approximate 94.4% general partner interest in the Operating
Partnership, excluding preferred units. The remaining 5.6%
limited partner interest is owned by non-affiliated investors
and certain current and former directors and officers of the
Company. For local law purposes, certain properties are owned
through limited partnerships and limited liability companies.
The ownership of such properties through such entities does not
materially affect the Company’s overall ownership interests
in the properties. As the sole general partner of the Operating
Partnership, the Company has full, exclusive, and complete
responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and
control of the Operating Partnership. Net operating results of
the Operating Partnership are allocated after preferred unit
distributions based on the respective partners’ ownership
interests.

Through the Operating Partnership, the Company
enters into co-investment joint ventures with institutional
investors. See note 10. These co-investment joint ventures
provide the Company with an additional source of capital to fund
certain acquisitions and development and renovation projects. As
of December 31, 2001, the Company had investments in five
co-investment joint ventures, which are consolidated for
financial reporting purposes.

AMB Capital Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“AMB Capital Partners”), the
predecessor-in-interest to AMB Investment Management, Inc.
(“AMB Investment Management”), provides real estate
investment services to clients on a fee basis. Headlands Realty
Corporation, a Maryland corporation, conducts a variety of
businesses that include incremental income programs, such as the
Company’s CustomerAssist Program and development projects
available for sale to third parties. On December 31, 2001,
AMB Investment Management was reorganized through a series of
related transactions into AMB Capital Partners. The Operating
Partnership is the managing member of AMB Capital Partners. On
May 31, 2001, the Operating Partnership acquired 100% of
the common stock of AMB Investment Management and Headlands
Realty Corporation from current and former executive officers of
the Company, a former executive officer of AMB Investment
Management, and a director of Headlands Realty Corporation,
thereby acquiring 100% of both entities’ capital stock. The
Operating Partnership began consolidating its investments in AMB
Investment Management and Headlands Realty Corporation on
May 31, 2001. Prior to May 31, 2001, the Operating
Partnership reflected its investment using the equity method.
The impact of consolidating AMB Investment Management and
Headlands Realty Corporation was not material.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned
905 industrial buildings and seven retail centers, located in 26
markets throughout the United States (unaudited). The
Company’s strategy is to become a leading provider of High
Throughput Distribution, or HTD, properties in
supply-constrained, in fill submarkets located near key
international passenger and cargo airports, highway systems, and
sea ports in major metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Chicago,
Dallas/ Fort Worth, Northern New Jersey/ New York City, the San
Francisco Bay Area, Southern California, Miami, and Seattle. As
of December 31, 2001, the industrial buildings, principally
warehouse distribution buildings, encompassed approximately
81.6 million rentable

square feet and were 94.5% leased to over 2,900
customers (unaudited). As of December 31, 2001, the retail
centers, principally grocer-anchored community shopping centers,
encompassed approximately 1.3 million rentable square feet
and were 89.3% leased to more than 160 customers
(unaudited).

As of December 31, 2001, through AMB Capital
Partners, the Company also managed industrial buildings and
retail centers, totaling approximately 2.7 million rentable
square feet on behalf of various clients (unaudited). In
addition, the Company has invested in industrial buildings,
totaling approximately 4.9 million rentable square feet,
through unconsolidated joint ventures (unaudited).

2.     Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

These consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Principles of Consolidation.

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows of the Company, its wholly-owned
qualified REIT subsidiaries, the Operating Partnership, and
joint ventures (the “Joint Ventures”), in which the
Company has a controlling interest. Third-party equity interests
in the Operating Partnership and the Joint Ventures are
reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial
statements. The Company also has three non-controlling limited
partnership interests in three separate unconsolidated real
estate joint ventures, which are accounted for under the equity
method. All significant intercompany amounts have been
eliminated.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in real estate are stated
at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be
recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is
reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying values for financial
reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a
property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may
not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated
expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The
estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently
uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future
economics and market conditions and the availability of capital.
If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to
the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets could
occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To
the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the
carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is
charged to income and is included with gains from disposition of
real estate, net on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company evaluated its properties held for divestiture and
operating properties for impairment and reduced their carrying
value by $18.6 million and $5.9 million in 2001 and
2000, respectively. The management of the Company believes that
there are no additional impairments of the carrying values of
its investments in real estate at December 31, 2001.

F-6


AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Depreciation and amortization are calculated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the real estate investments. The estimated lives and
components of depreciation and amortization expense for the
years ended December 31, are as follows:

The cost of buildings and improvements includes
the purchase price of the property or interest in property,
including legal fees and acquisition costs. Project costs
directly associated with the development and construction of a
real estate project, which include interest and property taxes,
are capitalized as construction in progress. Capitalized
interest related to construction projects for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $13.7 million,
$15.5 million, and $10.9 million, respectively.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
charged to operations as incurred. Maintenance expenditures
include planned major maintenance activities such as painting,
paving, HVAC, and roofing repair costs. The Company expenses
costs as incurred and does not accrue in advance of planned
major maintenance activities. Significant renovations or
betterments that extend the economic useful life of assets are
capitalized.

Reverse Exchanges.

Reverse exchanges represent loan
agreements with third parties, whereby the Company loans
substantially all funds to the third party to acquire a real
estate investment that we intend to acquire in a
Section 1031 exchange. The loan is secured by the real
estate investment and title is held by the third party. Upon
acquisition of the property by the third party, the Company
records the asset as an investment in real estate and records
the rental income and expenses associated with the property as
the Company retains the risk of loss and the benefits of the
asset. At December 31, 2001, the Company had one property
in a reverse exchange valued at $10.9 million.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

Other real estate companies compete
with the Company in its real estate markets. This results in
competition for customers to occupy space. The existence of
competing properties could have a material impact on the
Company’s ability to lease space and on the amount of rent
received. As of December 31, 2001, the Company did not have
any single tenant that accounted for greater than 1.3% of rental
revenues.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash
held in financial institutions and other highly liquid
short-term investments with original maturities of three months
or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash held in
escrow in connection with property purchases, exchange funds,
and capital improvements.

Accounts Receivable.

Accounts receivable includes all
current accounts receivable, other accruals, and deferred rent
receivable of $37.9 million and $28.0 million at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in connection with
financings are capitalized and amortized to interest expense
using the effective-interest method over the term of the related
loan. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, deferred financing
costs were $17.5 million and $10.7 million,
respectively, net of accumulated amortization of
$8.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Such
amounts are included in other assets on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

Investments in Other Companies.

Investments in other companies were
accounted for on a cost basis and realized gains and losses were
included in current earnings. For its investments in private
companies, the Company periodically reviewed its investments and
management determined if the value of such investments had been
permanently impaired. During 2001, the Company recognized losses
on its investments in other companies totaling
$20.8 million, including its investment in Webvan Group,
Inc. The Company had previously recognized gains and losses on
its investment in Webvan Group, Inc. as a component of other
comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2001, the Company
had realized a loss on 100% of its investments in other
companies.

Debt Premiums.

Debt
premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt over the
principal value of debt assumed in connection with the
Company’s initial public offering and subsequent
acquisitions. The debt premiums are being amortized into
interest expense over the term of the related debt instrument
using the effective interest method. As of December 31,
2001 and 2000, the net unamortized debt premium was
$6.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, and are
included as a component of secured debt on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

Rental Revenues.

The
Company, as a lessor, retains substantially all of the benefits
and risks of ownership of the properties and accounts for its
leases as operating leases. Rental income is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the leases. Reimbursements
from customers for real estate taxes and other recoverable
operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the
applicable expenses are incurred. Differences between estimated
and actual amounts are recognized in the subsequent year. In
addition, the Company nets its bad debt expense against rental
income for financial reporting purposes.

Investment Management Income.

Investment management income consists
primarily of asset management fees and acquisition and
disposition fees earned by AMB Capital Partners from joint
ventures and clients. Investment management income also includes
priority distributions from the Operating Partnership’s
co-investment joint ventures of $2.3 million in 2001.

Interest and Other Income.

Interest and other income consists
primarily of interest income from mortgages receivable and on
cash and cash equivalents.

Comprehensive Income.

Comprehensive income consists of net
income and unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in
equity securities and is presented in the consolidated
statements of stockholders’ equity.

Derivatives.

The
Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133 on derivatives on
January 1, 2001. The adoption did not impact its financial
position or results of operations as the Company does not
utilize derivative instruments in its operations. FASB Statement
No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,

as amended by Statement No. 138,

Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities,

establishes accounting and reporting
standards requiring that every derivative instrument (including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at its fair value. The Statement, as amended, requires
that changes in the derivative’s fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria
are met.

Reclassifications.

Certain items in the consolidated
financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to
conform with current classifications with no effect on results
of operations.

3.     Transactions
with Affiliates

Prior to January 1, 2002, the Company and
AMB Capital Partners had an agreement that allowed for the
sharing of certain costs and employees. Additionally, the
Company provided AMB Capital Partners with certain
acquisition-related services. For the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company allocated
$3.2 million, $2.8 million, and $2.7 million,
respectively, for shared costs to AMB Capital Partners.

The Company and AMB Capital Partners share common
office space under lease obligations. Such lease obligations are
charged to the Company and AMB Capital Partners at cost. For the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company
paid $0.9 million, $1.4 million, and
$1.3 million, respectively, for occupancy costs related to
the lease obligations of the affiliate.

As of May 31, 2001, the Company held all of
the outstanding capital stock of AMB Investment Management,
Inc., the predecessor-in-interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC.
On December 31, 2001, AMB Investment Management was
reorganized through a series of related transactions into AMB
Capital Partners. On May 31, 2001, the Operating
Partnership acquired 100% of the common stock of AMB Investment
Management from current and former executive officers of the
Company and a former executive officer of AMB Investment
Management, thereby owning 100% of the entities’ capital
stock, for $0.3 million. The Operating Partnership began
consolidating its investment in AMB Investment Management on
May 31, 2001. Prior to May 31, 2001, the Operating
Partnership owned 100% of AMB Investment Management’s
non-voting preferred stock (representing a 95% economic interest
therein) and reflected its investment using the equity method.

4.     Real Estate
Acquisition and Development Activity (square footage information
is unaudited)

During 2001, the Company invested
$428.3 million in operating properties, consisting of 65
industrial buildings aggregating approximately 6.8 million
square feet, which included the investment of
$219.5 million in 36 industrial buildings aggregating
approximately 3.8 million square feet through three of the
Company’s co-investment joint ventures.

During 2001, the Company also contributed
operating properties valued at $539.2 million, consisting
of 111 industrial buildings aggregating approximately
10.8 million square feet, to three of its co-investment
joint ventures. The properties contributed to the co-investment
joint ventures were reflected at the Company’s historical
cost because the Company controls these joint ventures and,
therefore, they were under common control. The Company
recognized a gain of $17.8 million related to these
contributions representing the portion of the contributed
properties acquired by the third party co-investors.

During 2001, the Company completed industrial and
retail developments valued at $148.0 million and
$73.9 million, respectively, aggregating approximately
2.3 million and $0.4 million square feet,
respectively. The Company also initiated new industrial
development projects valued at $9.7 million aggregating
approximately 0.2 million square feet.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company had in
its development pipeline: (1) 12 industrial projects, which
will total approximately 3.1 million square feet and have
an aggregate estimated investment by the Company and, in certain
instances, the Company’s co-investors of
$154.4 million upon completion; and (2) two
development projects available for sale, which will total
approximately 0.6 million square feet and have an aggregate
estimated investment of $50.0 million upon completion. As
of December 31, 2001, the Company and its Development
Alliance Partners have funded an aggregate of
$127.3 million and will need to fund an estimated
additional $77.1 million in order to complete current and
planned projects.

During 2000, the Company invested
$730.0 million in operating properties, consisting of 145
industrial buildings aggregating approximately 10.5 million
square feet. Of this, $185.6 million was acquired by the
Alliance Fund I, consisting of 44 industrial buildings,
aggregating approximately 2.6 million square feet. The
Company also initiated 17 new development projects, aggregating
approximately 4.5 million square feet, with a total
estimated cost of $224.0 million upon completion. In 2000,
the Company also completed 12 development projects, aggregating
approximately 3.1 million square feet, at a total aggregate
cost of $144.3 million.

5.     Property
Divestitures and Properties Held for Divestiture

Property Divestitures.

During 2001, the Company divested
itself of 24 industrial and two retail buildings, aggregating
approximately 3.2 million square feet (unaudited), for an
aggregate price of $193.4 million, with a resulting net
gain of $24.1 million, which is net of minority
interests’ share. The resulting net gain is before
impairment charges of $18.6 million and the gain on the
Company’s contributed properties of $17.8 million.

During 2000, the Company divested itself of 25
industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating
approximately 2.5 million square feet (unaudited), for an
aggregate price of $175.7 million, with a resulting net
gain of $7.0 million. The resulting net gain is before
impairment charges of $5.9 million. The retail center was
located in Los Angeles, California, aggregated approximately
0.4 million square feet, and sold for $89.0 million.
The Company carries a 9.5% mortgage note in the principal amount
of $74.0 million on the retail center sale. The mortgage note
matures in September 2002.

Properties Held for Divestiture.

The Company has decided to divest
itself of seven retail centers and three industrial properties,
which are not in its core markets or which do not meet its
strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are
subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary
conditions. Properties held for divestiture are stated at the
lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell.

The following summarizes the condensed results of
operations of the properties held for divestiture for the years
ended December 31:

6.     Mortgages
Receivable

In September 2000, the Company sold a retail
center located in Los Angeles, California. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company carried a 9.5% mortgage note
in the principal amount of $74.0 million on the retail
center. The maturity date of the mortgage note was extended to
September 30, 2002. During 2001, the Company renegotiated
this mortgage and received a $5.0 million pay-down on the
principal balance and increased the interest rate to 9.5% from
8.75%. The Company has a first lien against the retail center as
collateral for the mortgage note and believes that the
underlying value of the retail center is equal to or greater
than the fair value of the mortgage note.

also holds a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an
unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0%
and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2001, the
outstanding balance on the note was $13.2 million.

7.     Debt

Debt consisted of the following, as of
December 31:

Secured debt generally requires monthly principal
and interest payments. The secured debt is secured by deeds of
trust on certain properties. As of December 31, 2001 and
2000, the total gross investment book value of those properties
securing the debt was $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion,
respectively, including $1.2 billion and $0.7 billion,
respectively, in joint ventures. All of the secured debt bears
interest at fixed rates, except for three loans with an
aggregate principal amount of $52.4 million as of
December 31, 2001, and two loans with an aggregate
principal amount of $29.8 million as of December 31,
2000, which bear interest at variable rates (weighted average
interest rate of 3.8% as of December 31, 2001). The secured
debt has various financial and non-financial covenants.
Management believes that the Company and the Operating
Partnership were in material compliance with these covenants as
of December 31, 2001 and 2000. As of December 31,
2001, the Company had 22 non-recourse secured loans, which are
cross collateralized by 48 properties. As of December 31,
2001, the Company had $551.9 million (not including
unamortized debt premiums) outstanding on these loans. As of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, the estimated fair value of the
REIT and joint venture secured debt was $1.2 billion and
$1.0 billion, respectively.

Interest on the senior debt securities is payable
semi-annually. The 2015 notes are putable and callable in June
2005. The senior debt securities are subject to various
financial and non-financial covenants. Management believes that
the Company was in material compliance with these covenants at
December 31, 2001 and 2000. As of December 31, 2001 and
2000, the estimated fair value of the unsecured senior debt was
$802.4 million and $689.4 million, respectively.

In August 2000, the Operating Partnership
commenced a medium-term note program for the issuance of up to
$400.0 million in principal amount of medium-term notes,
which will be guaranteed by the Company. As of December 31,
2001, the Operating Partnership had issued $380.0 million
of medium-term notes under

F-11

this program, leaving $20.0 million
available for issuance. However, on January 14, 2002, the
Operating Partnership issued and sold the remaining $20.0
million of the notes under this program to Lehman Brothers,
Inc., as principal. The Company has guaranteed the notes, which
mature on January 17, 2007, and bear interest at 5.90% per
annum. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds of
$19.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially
repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional
properties. In September 2001, the Operating Partnership issued
and sold $25.0 million of the notes under this program to
Lehman Brothers Inc., as principal. The Company guaranteed the
notes, which mature on September 6, 2011, and bear interest
at 6.75%. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds of
$24.8 million for general corporate purposes, to partially
repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional
properties. In March 2001, the Operating Partnership issued and
sold $50.0 million of the notes under this program to First
Union Securities, Inc., as principal. The Company guaranteed the
notes, which mature on March 7, 2011, and bear interest at
7.00%. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds of
$49.7 million for general corporate purposes, to partially
repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional
properties. The notes have various financial and non-financial
covenants. In January 2001, the Operating Partnership issued and
sold $25.0 million of the notes under this program to A.G.
Edwards & Sons, Inc., as principal. The Company guaranteed
the notes, which mature on January 30, 2006, and bear
interest at 6.90%. The Operating Partnership used the net
proceeds of $24.9 million for general corporate purposes,
to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop
additional properties. Management believes that the Company and
the Operating Partnership were in material compliance with these
covenants at December 31, 2001.

In May 2000, the Operating Partnership entered
into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement.
The Company guarantees the Operating Partnership’s
obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility
matures in May 2003, has a one-year extension option, and is
subject to a 15 basis point annual facility fee based on the
Company’s credit rating. The credit facility has various
financial and non-financial covenants. Management believes that
the Company and the Operating Partnership were in material
compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2001. The
Operating Partnership has the ability to increase available
borrowings to $700.0 million by adding additional banks to
the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to
increase their commitments. Monthly debt service payments on the
credit facility are interest only. The total amount available
under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing
base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility.
As of December 31, 2001, the remaining amount available
under the credit facility was $488.0 million (excluding the
additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity).

In July 2001, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II,
L.P. (“Alliance Fund II”) obtained a
$150.0 million credit facility from Bank of America, N.A.
Borrowings currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis
points. The credit facility is secured by the unfunded capital
commitments of the third party investors in AMB Institutional
Alliance REIT II, Inc. (“Alliance REIT II”) and the
Alliance Fund II. As of December 31, 2001, the outstanding
balance was $123.5 million and the remaining amount
available was $26.5 million. The credit facility has
various financial and non-financial covenants. Management
believes that the Company and the Operating Partnership were in
material compliance with these covenants at December 31,
2001.

During 2001, the Operating Partnership retired
$55.2 million of secured debt prior to maturity. The
Operating Partnership recognized a net extraordinary loss of
$0.6 million related to the early debt retirement.

2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company recognized percentage rent
revenues related to its retail properties of $0.5 million,
$0.8 million, and $2.0 million, respectively. Some
leases contain options to renew.

9.     Income
Taxes

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under
the Code, commencing with its taxable year ended
December 31, 1997. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must
meet a number of organizational and operational requirements,
including a requirement that it currently distribute at least
90% of its taxable income to its stockholders. It is
management’s current intention to adhere to these
requirements and maintain the Company’s REIT status. As a
REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to corporate
level federal income tax on net income it distributes currently
to its stockholders. As such, no provision for federal income
taxes has been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT
in any taxable year, then it will be subject to federal income
taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable
alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a
REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if the Company
qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to
certain state and local taxes on its income and property and to
federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable
income.

The following reconciles net income available to
common stockholders to taxable income available to common
stockholders for the years ended December 31:

(1)

Primarily due to straight-line rent, prepaid
	rent, and debt premium amortization timing differences.

For income tax purposes, distributions paid to
common stockholders consist of ordinary income, capital gains,
or a combination thereof. For the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company elected to distribute all of
its taxable capital gain. Dividends paid per share for the years
ended December 31, were taxable as follows:

10.     Minority
Interests

Minority interests in the Company represent the
limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and
interests held by certain third parties in several real estate
joint ventures, aggregating approximately 28.7 million square
feet (unaudited), which are consolidated for financial reporting
purposes (unaudited). Such investments are consolidated because:
(1) the Company owns a majority interest; or (2) the
Company exercises significant control over major operating
decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property
managers, and changes in financing.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

The Company has non-controlling limited
partnership interests in three separate unconsolidated joint
ventures. The Company accounts for the joint ventures using the
equity method of accounting. Under the agreements governing the
joint ventures, the Company and the other party to the joint
venture may be required to make additional capital
contributions, and subject to certain limitations, the joint
ventures may incur additional debt. The Company has a 56.1%

that is reflected in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. The Series C
Preferred Units had a par value of $110.0 million.

On September 21, 2001, the Operating
Partnership issued and sold 800,000 7.95% Series J
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a
price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions
are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly
in arrears. The Series J Preferred Units are redeemable by
the Operating Partnership on or after September 21, 2006,
subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price
equal to $50.00 per unit, plus accumulated and unpaid
distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The
Series J Preferred Units are exchangeable, at specified
times and subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis,
for shares of the Company’s Series J Preferred Stock.
The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds of
$38.9 million for general corporate purposes, which may
include the partial repayment of indebtedness or the acquisition
or development of additional properties.

On March 21, 2001, AMB Property II issued
and sold 510,000 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per
unit in a private placement. Distributions are cumulative from
the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate
per unit equal to $4.00 per annum. The Series I Preferred
Units are redeemable by AMB Property II on or after
March 21, 2006, subject to certain conditions, for cash at
a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus accumulated
and unpaid distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption
date. The Series I Preferred Units are exchangeable, at
specified times and subject to certain conditions, on a
one-for-one basis, for shares of the Company’s
Series I Preferred Stock. AMB Property II used the net
proceeds of $24.9 million to repay advances from the
Operating Partnership and to make a loan to the Operating
Partnership. The Operating Partnership used the funds to
partially repay borrowings under its unsecured credit facility
and for general corporate purposes. The loan bears interest at
8.0% per annum and is payable on demand.

During 2001, the Company redeemed 223,092 and
635,798 common limited partnership units of the Operating
Partnership for cash and shares of its common stock,
respectively. Holders of common limited partnership units of the
Operating Partnership have the right, commencing generally on or
after the first anniversary of the holder becoming a limited
partner of the Operating Partnership (or such other date agreed
to by the Operating Partnership and the applicable unit
holders), to require the Operating Partnership to redeem part or
all of their common units for cash (based upon the fair market
value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at the
time of redemption) or the Operating Partnership may, in its
sole and absolute discretion (subject to the limits on ownership
and transfer of common stock set forth in the Company’s
charter) elect to have the Company exchange those common units
for shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one
basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock
dividends, issuance of certain rights, certain extraordinary
distributions and similar events. The Company presently
anticipates that the Operating Partnership will generally elect
to have it issue shares of its common stock in exchange for
common units in connection with a redemption request; however,
the Operating Partnership has paid cash, and may in the future
pay cash, for a redemption of common units. With each redemption
or exchange, the Company’s percentage ownership in the
Operating Partnership will increase. Common limited partners may
exercise this redemption right from time to time, in whole or in
part, subject to the limitations that limited partners may not
exercise the right set forth in the Company’s charter if
such exercise would result in any person actually or
constructively owning shares of common stock in excess of the
ownership limit or any other amount specified by the board of
directors, assuming common stock was issued in the exchange.

The Company’s board of directors approved a
stock repurchase program in 1999 for the repurchase of up to
$100.0 million worth of common stock. During 2001, the
Company repurchased 1,392,600 shares of its common stock at an
average purchase price of $23.62 per share under this program.
Through December 31, 2001, the Company has repurchased
2,836,200 shares of its common stock at an average purchase
price of $21.22 per share. During 2000, the Company did not
repurchase any shares of its common stock. The Company’s
stock repurchase program expired in December 2001. The
Company’s board of directors approved

F-17


AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION

a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase
of up to $100.0 million worth of common stock. The new
stock repurchase program expires in December 2003 and no
repurchases were made under the new program in 2001.

The following table sets forth the dividend
payments per share or unit for the years ended December 31:

13.     Stock
Incentive Plan, 401(k) Plan, and Deferred Compensation
Plan

Stock Incentive Plan.

In November 1997, the Company
established a Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “Stock
Incentive Plan”) for the purpose of attracting and
retaining eligible officers, directors, and employees. The
Company has reserved for issuance 8,950,000 shares of
Common Stock under the Stock Incentive Plan. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company had 7,437,219 non-qualified
options outstanding granted to certain directors, officers, and
employees. Each option is exchangeable for one share of the
Company’s Common Stock. The options have a weighted average
exercise price of $22.16 and the exercise prices range from
$18.94 to $26.53. Each option’s exercise price is equal to
the Company’s market price on the date of grant. The
options had an original ten-year term and generally vest pro
rata in annual installments over a three- or four-year period
from the date of grant.

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related
interpretations in accounting for its Stock Incentive Plan.
Opinion 25 measures compensation cost using the intrinsic value
based method of accounting. Under this method, compensation cost
is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock
at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to
acquire the stock. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for the Company’s Stock Incentive Plan as of
December 31, 2001.

As permitted by SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-based Compensation,” the Company
has not changed the method of accounting for stock options but
has provided the additional required disclosures. Had
compensation cost for the Company’s stock-based
compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at
the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the
method of SFAS No. 123, the Company’s pro forma net
income available to common stockholders would have been reduced
by $3.9 million, $2.7 million, and $3.2 million
and pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share would have
been reduced to $1.44 and $1.42, and $1.32 and $1.31, and $1.92
and $1.92, respectively, for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000, and 1999.

F-18


AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of each option grant was estimated
at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following assumptions used for grants in 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively: dividend yields of 6.4%, 6.5%, and
7.2%; expected volatility of 14.9%, 13.3%, and 18.5%; risk-free
interest rates of 5.2%, 6.1%, and 5.4%; and expected lives of
10 years for each year.

Following is a summary of the option activity for
the years ended December 31:

In 2001, 2000, and 1999, under the Stock
Incentive Plan, the Company issued 238,790, 162,229, and 100,000
restricted shares, respectively, to certain officers of the
Company as part of the performance pay program and in connection
with employment with the Company. As of December 31, 2001,
2,732 shares of restricted stock have been forfeited. The
547,006 outstanding restricted shares are subject to repurchase
rights, which generally lapse over a period from three to five
years.

401(k) Plan.

In
November 1997, the Company established a Section 401(k)
Savings/ Retirement Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), which is
a continuation of the 401(k) Plan of the predecessor, to cover
eligible employees of the Company and any designated affiliates.
During 2001 and 2000, the 401(k) Plan permitted eligible
employees of the Company to defer up to 20% of their annual
compensation, subject to certain limitations imposed by the
Code. The employees’ elective deferrals are immediately
vested and non-forfeitable upon contribution to the 401(k) Plan.
During 2001 and 2000, the Company matched the employee
contributions to the 401(k) Plan in an amount equal to 50% of
the first 5.5% of annual compensation deferred by each employee.
The Company may also make discretionary contributions to the
401(k) Plan. In 2001 and 2000, the Company paid
$0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for its
401(k) match.

Deferred Compensation
Plan.

Effective September 1,
1999, the Company established a non-qualified deferred
compensation plan for officers of the Company and certain of its
affiliates. As of January 1, 2002, the plan enables
participants to defer income up to 100% of annual base pay and
up to 100% of annual bonuses on

F-19


AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

a pre-tax basis. The Company may make
discretionary matching contributions to participant accounts at
any time. The Company made no such discretionary matching
contributions in 2001, 2000, or 1999. The participant’s
elective deferrals and any matching contributions are
immediately 100% vested. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
the total amount of compensation deferred was $1.7 million
and $1.0 million, respectively.

14.     Income Per
Share

The Company’s only dilutive securities
outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000,
and 1999 were stock options and restricted stock granted under
its stock incentive plan. The effect on income per share was to
increase weighted average shares outstanding. Such dilution was
computed using the treasury stock method.

15.     Commitments
and Contingencies

Commitments

Lease Commitments.

The Company has entered into operating ground leases on certain
land parcels with periods up to 40 years and a lease on a
building in New York City. Future minimum rental payments
required under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of
December 31, 2001, were as follows:

These operating lease payments are being
amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases.

Contingencies

Litigation.

In the
normal course of business, from time to time, the Company may be
involved in legal actions relating to the ownership and
operations of its properties. In management’s opinion, the
liabilities, if any, that may ultimately result from such legal
actions are not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows of the Company.

Environmental
Matters.

The Company monitors its
properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
The Company is not aware of any environmental liability with
respect to the properties that would have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business, assets, or results of
operations. However, there can be no assurance that such a
material environmental liability does not exist. The existence
of any such material environmental liability would have an
adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and
cash flow.

F-20


AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

General Uninsured
Losses.

The Company carries property
and rental loss, liability, flood, and environmental insurance.
The Company believes that the policy terms and conditions,
limits, and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the
circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the cost of such
coverage, and industry practice. In addition, certain of the
Company’s properties are located in areas that are subject
to earthquake activity; therefore, the Company has obtained
limited earthquake insurance on those properties. There are,
however, certain types of extraordinary losses that may be
either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Should an
uninsured loss occur, the Company could lose its investment in,
and anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property.

Captive Insurance
Company.

The Company has responded to
recent trends towards increasing costs and decreasing coverage
availability in the insurance markets by obtaining
higher-deductible property insurance from third party insurers
and by forming a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata
National Insurance Ltd. (“Arcata”) in December 2001.
Arcata will generally provide insurance coverage for losses
below the increased deductible under the third party policies.
Premiums paid to Arcata have a retrospective component, so that
if expenses, including losses, are less than premiums collected,
the excess will be returned to the property owners (and, in
turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, if
expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected,
an additional premium, not in excess of the difference, will be
charged. Through this structure, The Company believes that it
will be able to obtain insurance for its portfolio with more
comprehensive coverage at a projected overall lower cost than
would otherwise be available in the market.

16.     Quarterly
Financial Data (Unaudited)

Selected quarterly financial data for 2001 and
2000 is as follows:

Information

The Company operates industrial and retail
properties nationwide and manages its business both by property
type and by market. Industrial properties consist primarily of
warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or
multiple customers and are typically comprised of multiple
buildings that are leased to customers engaged in various types
of businesses. As of December 31, 2001, the Company
operated industrial properties in eight hub and gateway markets
in addition to 18 other markets nationwide. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company operated retail properties
in Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston,
and Baltimore. The Company does not separately report its retail
operations by market. Retail properties are generally leased to
one or more anchor customers, such as grocery and drug stores,
and various retail businesses. The accounting policies of the
segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates
performance based upon property net operating income of the
combined properties in each segment. The Company’s
geographic markets for industrial properties are managed
separately because each market requires different operating,
pricing, and leasing strategies.

During the first quarter of 2001, the Company
split its industrial segment into geographic hub and gateway
markets and other markets. Within the hub and gateway market
categorization, the Company operates in eight major U.S.
markets. The other industrial markets category captures all of
the Company’s

18. New Accounting Pronouncements

In June and August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards Nos. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,

and 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

Under FASB Statement
No. 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recognized in the period in which
it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be
made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as
part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. FASB
Statement No. 144 retains FASB Statement
No. 121’s,

Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,

fundamental provisions for the: (1) recognition and
measurement of impairment of long-lived assets to be held and
used; and (2) measurement of long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale. The Company does not believe that either
FASB Statement No. 143 or No. 144 will have a material
impact on its financial position or results of operations. FASB
Statement No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2002, and FASB Statement No. 144 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos.
141,

Business Combinations,

and 142,

Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.

Under FASB Statement No. 141,
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, must
use the purchase method of accounting. The pooling of interest
method of accounting is prohibited. Under FASB Statement
No. 142, intangible assets acquired in a business
combination must be recorded separately from goodwill if they
arise from contractual or other legal right or are separable
from the acquired entity and can be sold, transferred, licensed,
rented, or exchanged, regardless of the acquirer’s intent
to do so. The Company does not believe that either FASB
Statement No. 141 or No. 142 will have a material
impact on its financial position or results of operations. FASB
Statement No. 141 was effective for business combinations
initiated after July 1, 2001, and FASB Statement
No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001.
