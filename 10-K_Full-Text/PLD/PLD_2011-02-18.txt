EXPLANATORY
    NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 of AMB Property
    Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or
    the context otherwise requires: references to “AMB Property
    Corporation”, the “Parent Company” or the
    “parent company” mean AMB Property Corporation, a
    Maryland corporation, and its controlled subsidiaries; and
    references to “AMB Property, L.P.”, the
    “Operating Partnership” or the “operating
    partnership” mean AMB Property, L.P., a Delaware limited
    partnership, and its controlled subsidiaries. The terms
    “the Company” and “the company” mean the
    parent company, the operating partnership and their controlled
    subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In addition, references to
    the company, the parent company or the operating partnership
    could mean the entity itself or one or a number of their
    controlled subsidiaries.

The parent company is a real estate investment trust and the
    general partner of the operating partnership. As of
    December 31, 2010, the parent company owned an approximate
    98.2% general partnership interest in the operating partnership,
    excluding preferred units. The remaining approximate 1.8% common
    limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated
    investors and certain current and former directors and officers
    of the parent company. As of December 31, 2010, the parent
    company owned all of the preferred limited partnership units of
    the operating partnership. As the sole general partner of the
    operating partnership, the parent company has the full,
    exclusive and complete responsibility for the operating
    partnership’s

day-to-day

management and control.

The company believes combining the annual reports on

Form 10-K

of the parent company and the operating partnership into this
    single report results in the following benefits:

•

enhancing investors’ understanding of the parent company
    and the operating partnership by enabling investors to view the
    business as a whole in the same manner as management views and
    operates the business;

•

eliminating duplicative disclosure and providing a more
    streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial
    portion of the company’s disclosure applies to both the
    parent company and the operating partnership; and

•

creating time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of
    one combined report instead of two separate reports.

Management operates the parent company and the operating
    partnership as one enterprise. The management of the parent
    company consists of the same members as the management of the
    operating partnership. These members are officers of the parent
    company and employees of the operating partnership.

There are few differences between the parent company and the
    operating partnership, which are reflected in the disclosure in
    this report. The company believes it is important to understand
    the differences between the parent company and the operating
    partnership in the context of how the parent company and the
    operating partnership operate as an interrelated consolidated
    company. The parent company is a real estate investment trust,
    whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership
    interests of the operating partnership. As a result, the parent
    company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as
    the sole general partner of the operating partnership, issuing
    public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of
    the operating partnership. The parent company itself does not
    hold any indebtedness but guarantees some of the secured and
    unsecured debt of the operating partnership, as disclosed in
    this report. The operating partnership holds substantially all
    the assets of the company and directly or indirectly holds the
    ownership interests in the company’s joint ventures. The
    operating partnership conducts the operations of the business
    and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded
    equity. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by
    the parent company, which are contributed to the operating
    partnership in exchange for partnership units, the operating
    partnership generates the capital required by the company’s
    business through the operating partnership’s operations, by
    the operating partnership’s direct or indirect incurrence
    of indebtedness or through the issuance of partnership units of
    the operating partnership or its subsidiaries.

Noncontrolling interests and stockholders’ equity and
    partners’ capital are the main areas of difference between
    the consolidated financial statements of the parent company and
    those of the operating partnership. The common limited
    partnership interests in the operating partnership are accounted
    for as partners’ capital in the



operating partnership’s financial statements and as
    noncontrolling interests in the parent company’s financial
    statements. The noncontrolling interests in the operating
    partnership’s financial statements include the interests of
    joint venture partners, and preferred limited partnership
    unitholders (if applicable) and common limited partnership
    unitholders of AMB Property II, L.P., a subsidiary of the
    operating partnership. The noncontrolling interests in the
    parent company’s financial statements include the same
    noncontrolling interests at the operating partnership level and
    limited partnership unitholders of the operating partnership.
    The differences between stockholders’ equity and
    partners’ capital result from the differences in the equity
    issued at the parent company and operating partnership levels.

To help investors understand the significant differences between
    the parent company and the operating partnership, this report
    presents the following separate sections for each of the parent
    company and the operating partnership:

•

consolidated financial statements;

•

the following notes to the consolidated financial statements:

•

Debt;

•

Income taxes;

•

Noncontrolling Interests;

•

Stockholders’ Equity of the Parent Company/Partners’
    Capital of the Operating Partnership; and

•

Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

This report also includes separate Item 9A. Controls and
    Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32
    certifications for each of the parent company and the operating
    partnership in order to establish that the Chief Executive
    Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each entity have made
    the requisite certifications and that the parent company and
    operating partnership are compliant with

Rule 13a-15

or

Rule 15d-15

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C.
    § 1350.

In order to highlight the differences between the parent company
    and the operating partnership, the separate sections in this
    report for the parent company and the operating partnership
    specifically refer to the parent company and the operating
    partnership. In the sections that combine disclosure of the
    parent company and the operating partnership, this report refers
    to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the
    company. Although the operating partnership is generally the
    entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and
    joint ventures and holds assets and debt, reference to the
    company is appropriate because the business is one enterprise
    and the parent company operates the business through the
    operating partnership.

As general partner with control of the operating partnership,
    the parent company consolidates the operating partnership for
    financial reporting purposes, and the parent company does not
    have significant assets other than its investment in the
    operating partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of
    the parent company and the operating partnership are the same on
    their respective financial statements. The separate discussions
    of the parent company and the operating partnership in this
    report should be read in conjunction with each other to
    understand the results of the company on a consolidated basis
    and how management operates the company.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS

Some of the information included in this annual report on

Form 10-K

contains forward-looking statements, such as those related to
    our capital resources, portfolio performance, results of
    operations and management’s beliefs and expectations, which
    are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended. Because these forward-looking statements involve
    numerous risks and uncertainties, there are important factors
    that could cause the company’s actual results to differ
    materially from those in the forward-looking statements, and you
    should not rely on the forward-looking statements as predictions
    of future events. The events or circumstances reflected in the
    forward-looking statements might not occur. You can identify
    forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking
    terminology such as “believes,” “expects,”
    “may,” “will,” “should,”
    “seeks,” “approximately,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “forecasting,”
    “pro forma,” “estimates” or
    “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and
    phrases, or similar words or phrases. You can also identify
    forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or
    intentions. Forward-looking statements should not be read as
    guarantees of future performance or results, and will not
    necessarily be accurate indicators of whether, or the time at
    which, such performance or results will be achieved. There is no
    assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in
    forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved.
    Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on
    assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise
    and the company may not be able to realize them.

The following factors, among others, apply to the
    company’s business as a whole and could cause its actual
    results and future events to differ materially from those set
    forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:

•

changes in general economic conditions in California, the
    U.S. or globally (including financial market fluctuations),
    global trade or in the real estate sector (including risks
    relating to decreasing real estate valuations and impairment
    charges);

•

risks associated with using debt to fund the company’s
    business activities, including re-financing and interest rate
    risks;

•

the company’s failure to obtain, renew, or extend
    necessary financing or access the debt or equity markets;

•

the company’s failure to maintain its current credit
    agency ratings or comply with its debt covenants;

•

risks related to the proposed merger transaction with
    ProLogis, including litigation related to the merger, any
    decreases in the market price of ProLogis stock and the risk
    that, if completed, the merger may not achieve its intended
    results;

•

risks associated with the ability to consummate the merger
    and the timing of the closing of the merger;

•

risks related to the company’s obligations in the event
    of certain defaults under co-investment venture and other
    debt;

•

risks associated with equity and debt securities financings
    and issuances (including the risk of dilution);

•

defaults on or non-renewal of leases by customers, lease
    renewals at lower than expected rent or failure to lease
    properties at all or on favorable rents and terms;

•

difficulties in identifying properties, portfolios of
    properties, or interests in real-estate related entities or
    platforms to acquire and in effecting acquisitions on
    advantageous terms and the failure of acquisitions to perform as
    the company expects;

•

unknown liabilities acquired in connection with acquired
    properties, portfolios of properties, or interests in
    real-estate related entities;

•

the company’s failure to successfully integrate acquired
    properties and operations;

•

risks and uncertainties affecting property development,
    redevelopment and value-added conversion (including construction
    delays, cost overruns, the company’s inability to obtain
    necessary permits and financing,



the company’s inability to lease properties at all or at
    favorable rents and terms, and public opposition to these
    activities);

•

the company’s failure to set up additional funds,
    attract additional investment in existing funds or to contribute
    properties to its co-investment ventures due to such factors as
    its inability to acquire, develop, or lease properties that meet
    the investment criteria of such ventures, or the co-investment
    ventures’ inability to access debt and equity capital to
    pay for property contributions or their allocation of available
    capital to cover other capital requirements;

•

risks and uncertainties relating to the disposition of
    properties to third parties and the company’s ability to
    effect such transactions on advantageous terms and to timely
    reinvest proceeds from any such dispositions;

•

risks of doing business internationally and global expansion,
    including unfamiliarity with new markets and currency risks;

•

risks of changing personnel and roles;

•

losses in excess of the company’s insurance coverage;

•

changes in local, state and federal regulatory requirements,
    including changes in real estate and zoning laws;

•

increases in real property tax rates;

•

risks associated with the company’s tax structuring;

•

increases in interest rates and operating costs or greater
    than expected capital expenditures; and

•

environmental uncertainties and risks related to natural
    disasters.

In addition, if the parent company fails to qualify and
    maintain its status as a real estate investment trust under the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the parent
    company’s actual results and future events could differ
    materially from those set forth or contemplated in the
    forward-looking statements.

The company’s success also depends upon economic trends
    generally, various market conditions and fluctuations and those
    other risk factors discussed under the heading “Risk
    Factors” in Item 1A of this report. The company
    cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking
    statements, which reflect the company’s analysis only and
    speak as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated
    in the statements. All of the company’s forward-looking
    statements, including those in this report, are qualified in
    their entirety by this statement. The company assumes no
    obligation to update or supplement forward-looking
    statements.

The company uses the terms “industrial properties” or
    “industrial buildings” to describe the various types
    of industrial properties in its portfolio and uses these terms
    interchangeably with the following: logistics facilities,
    centers or warehouses, High Throughput
    Distribution

)

    facilities; or any combination of these terms. The company uses
    the term “owned and managed” to describe assets in
    which it has at least a 10% ownership interest, for which it is
    the property or asset manager and which it currently intends to
    hold for the long term. The company uses the term “joint
    venture” to describe all joint ventures, including
    co-investment ventures with real estate developers, other real
    estate operators, or institutional investors where the company
    may or may not have control, act as the manager

and/or

developer, earn asset management distributions or fees, or earn
    incentive distributions or promote interests. In certain cases,
    the company might provide development, leasing, property
    management

and/or

accounting services, for which it may receive compensation. The
    company uses the term “co-investment venture” to
    describe joint ventures with institutional investors, managed by
    the company, from which the company typically receives
    acquisition fees for acquisitions, portfolio and asset
    management distributions or fees, as well as incentive
    distributions or promote interests. Unless otherwise indicated,
    management’s discussion and analysis applies to both the
    operating partnership and the parent company.

PART I

Item 1.

Business

The
    Company

The company is an owner, operator and developer of global
    industrial real estate, focused on major hub and gateway
    distribution markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. As of
    December 31, 2010, the company owned, or had investments
    in, on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint
    ventures, properties and development projects expected to total
    approximately 159.6 million square feet (14.8 million
    square meters) in 49 markets within 15 countries.

Of the approximately 159.6 million square feet as of
    December 31, 2010:

•

on an owned and managed basis, which includes investments held
    on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint
    ventures, the company owned or partially owned approximately
    141.9 million square feet (principally, warehouse
    distribution buildings) that were 93.7% leased; the company had
    investments in eight development projects, which are expected to
    total approximately 2.2 million square feet upon
    completion; the company owned 25 development projects, totaling
    approximately 6.8 million square feet, which are available
    for sale or contribution; and the company had three value-added
    acquisitions, totaling approximately 1.2 million square
    feet;

•

through non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, the company
    had investments in 46 industrial operating buildings, totaling
    approximately 7.3 million square feet; and

•

152,000 square feet of office space subject to a ground
    lease, which is the location of its global headquarters.

The company’s business is operated primarily through the
    operating partnership. As of December 31, 2010, the parent
    company owned an approximate 98.2% general partnership interest
    in the operating partnership, excluding preferred units. As the
    sole general partner of the operating partnership, the parent
    company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for
    and discretion in its

day-to-day

management and control.

The parent company is a self-administered and self-managed real
    estate investment trust and it expects that it has qualified,
    and will continue to qualify, as a real estate investment trust
    for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended
    December 31, 1997. As a self-administered and self-managed
    real estate investment trust, the company’s own employees
    perform its corporate, administrative and management functions,
    rather than the company relying on an outside manager for these
    services.

The company believes that real estate is fundamentally a local
    business and is best operated by local teams in each of its
    markets. As a vertically integrated company, the company
    actively manages its portfolio of properties. In select markets,
    the company may, from time to time, establish relationships with
    third-party real estate management firms, brokers and developers
    that provide some property-level administrative and management
    services under the company’s direction.

The parent company was incorporated in the state of Maryland in
    1997, and the operating partnership was formed in the state of
    Delaware in 1997. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 17
    of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
    segment information related to the company’s operations and
    information regarding geographic areas.

The company’s global headquarters are located at Pier 1,
    Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111; the company’s
    telephone number is

(415) 394-9000.

The company’s other principal office locations are in
    Amsterdam, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Shanghai,
    Singapore and Tokyo.

Investment
    Strategy

The company’s investment strategy focuses on providing
    distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses
    are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of
    goods through the global supply chain. The company’s
    properties are primarily located in the world’s busiest
    distribution markets featuring large, supply-constrained infill
    locations with dense populations and proximity to airports,
    seaports and ground transportation



systems. When measured by annualized base rent, on an owned and
    managed basis, a substantial majority of the company’s
    portfolio of industrial properties is located in its target
    markets and much of this is in infill submarkets. Infill
    locations are characterized by supply constraints on the
    availability of land for competing projects as well as physical,
    political or economic barriers to new development. The company
    believes that its facilities are essential to creating
    efficiencies in the supply chain, and that its business
    encompasses a blend of real estate, global logistics and
    infrastructure.

In its target markets, the company focuses on
    HTD

®

facilities, industrial properties designed to facilitate the
    rapid distribution of its customers’ products rather than
    the long-term storage of goods. The company’s investment
    focus on
    HTD

®

assets is based on what it believes to be a global trend toward
    lower inventory levels and expedited supply chains.
    HTD

®

facilities generally have a variety of physical and location
    characteristics that allow for the rapid transport of goods from
    point to point. These physical characteristics could include
    numerous dock doors, shallower building depths, fewer columns,
    large truck courts and more space for trailer parking. The
    company believes that these building characteristics help its
    customers reduce their costs and become more efficient in their
    logistics operations. The company’s customers include
    logistics, freight forwarding and air-express companies with
    time-sensitive needs that value facilities proximate to
    transportation infrastructure.

The company believes that changes in global trade have been a
    primary driver of demand for industrial real estate for decades.
    The company has observed that demand for industrial real estate
    is further influenced by the long-term relationship between
    trade and GDP. Trade and GDP are correlated as higher levels of
    investment, production and consumption within a globalized
    economy are consistent with increased levels of imports and
    exports. As the world produces and consumes more, the company
    believes that the volume of global trade will continue to
    increase at a rate in excess of growth in global GDP. In the
    second half of the year, improving consumer demand and
    double-digit gains in global production and trade led customers
    to begin rebuilding their inventory levels, which is a trend
    that management believes will strengthen in 2011. Management
    also believes that its key hub and gateway markets will continue
    to lead the recovery in operating fundamentals and that a
    stronger recovery of fundamentals is expected to take hold in
    2011, with further increases in positive net absorption and
    declining availabilities.

Primary
    Sources of Revenue and Earnings

The primary source of the company’s core earnings is
    revenue received from its real estate operations and private
    capital business. The principal contributor of its core earnings
    is rent received from customers under long-term (generally three
    to 10 years) operating leases at its properties, including
    reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs and
    asset management fees. The company also generates core earnings
    from its private capital business, including priority
    distributions, acquisition and development reimbursements,
    promote interests and incentive distributions from its
    co-investment ventures. The company may generate additional
    earnings from the disposition of assets in its

development-for-sale

and value-added conversion programs, as well as from land sales.

Long-Term
    Growth Strategies

The company believes that its long-term growth will be driven by
    its ability to:

•

maintain and increase occupancy rates

and/or

increase rental rates at its properties;

•

raise third-party equity and grow earnings generated from its
    private capital business by way of the acquisition and
    development of new properties or through the possible management
    of third party assets co-invested with the company;

•

acquire industrial real estate with total returns above the
    company’s cost of capital; and

•

develop properties profitably and then either hold or sell them
    to third-parties.



Growth
    Through Operations

The company seeks to generate long-term internal growth by
    maintaining a high occupancy rate at its properties, by
    controlling expenses and through contractual rent increases on
    existing space, thus capitalizing on the economies of scale
    inherent in owning, operating and growing a large global
    portfolio. The company actively manages its portfolio by
    establishing leasing strategies and negotiating lease terms,
    pricing, and level and timing of property improvements. With
    respect to its leasing strategies, the company takes a long-term
    view to ensure it maximizes the value of its real estate. As the
    company continues to work through a challenging operating
    environment and to provide flexibility to its customers, the
    company evaluates and adjusts its leasing strategies for market
    terms and leasing rates, which may include shorter leasing
    terms. The company believes that its long-standing focus on
    customer relationships and ability to provide global solutions
    for a well-diversified customer base in the logistics, shipping
    and air cargo industries will enable it to capitalize on
    opportunities as they arise.

The company believes the strategic infill locations within its
    portfolio, the experience of its cycle-tested operations team
    and its ability to respond quickly to the needs of its customers
    provides a competitive advantage in leasing. Management believes
    the company’s regular maintenance, capital expenditure,
    energy management and sustainability programs create cost
    efficiencies that benefit the company and its customers.

Growth
    Through Co-Investments

The company, through AMB Capital Partners, LLC, its private
    capital group, was one of the pioneers of the real estate
    investment trust (REIT) industry’s co-investment model and
    has more than 27 years of experience in asset management
    and fund formation. The company co-invests in properties with
    private capital investors through partnerships, limited
    liability companies or other joint ventures. The company has a
    direct and long-standing relationship with a significant number
    of institutional investors. As of December 31, 2010, more
    than 56% of the company’s owned and managed operating
    portfolio is held through its nine significant co-investment
    ventures and funds. The company tailors industrial portfolios to
    investors’ specific needs in separate or commingled
    accounts and deploys capital in both close-ended and open-ended
    structures, while providing complete portfolio management and
    financial reporting services. Generally, the company is the
    largest investor in its open-ended funds and owns a

10-50%

interest in its co-investment ventures. The company believes its
    significant ownership in each of its funds provides a strong
    alignment of interests with its co-investment partners’
    interests.

The company believes its co-investment program with private
    capital investors will continue to serve as a source of capital
    for new investments and revenues for its stockholders. In
    anticipation of the formation of future

co-investment

ventures, the company may also hold acquired and newly developed
    properties for contribution to future co-investment ventures.
    The company may make additional investments through its existing
    co-investment ventures or to new co-investment ventures in the
    future and currently plans to do so. The company is in various
    stages of discussions with prospective investors to attract new
    capital to take advantage of potential future opportunities and
    these capital-raising activities may include the formation of
    new joint ventures. Such transactions, if the company completes
    them, may be material individually or in aggregate.

Growth
    Through Acquisitions and Capital Redeployment

The company believes its acquisition experience and its network
    of property management, leasing and acquisition resources will
    continue to provide opportunities for growth. In addition to its
    internal resources, the company has long-standing relationships
    with lenders, leasing and investment sales brokers, as well as
    third-party local property management firms, which may give it
    access to additional acquisition opportunities. The company is
    actively monitoring opportunities in its target markets and
    intends to acquire high-quality, well-located industrial real
    estate.

Additionally, the company seeks to acquire industrial properties
    that are wholly or partially vacant as a part of
    management’s belief that the discount in pricing attributed
    to the operating challenges of such a property could provide
    greater returns once it is stabilized. Value-added acquisitions
    represent unstabilized properties acquired by the company, which
    generally have one or more of the following characteristics:
    (i) existing vacancy, typically in excess of 20%,
    (ii) short-term lease rollover, typically during the first
    two years of ownership, or (iii) significant capital
    improvement requirements, typically in excess of 20% of the
    purchase price. The company excludes value-



added acquisitions from its owned and managed and consolidated
    operating statistics prior to stabilization (generally 90%
    leased) in order to provide investors with data which it feels
    better reflect the performance of its core portfolio. The
    company strives to enhance the quality of its portfolio through
    acquisitions that are accretive to the company’s earnings
    and its net asset value. The company also seeks to redeploy
    capital from the sale of non-strategic assets into properties
    that better fit its current investment focus.

The company is generally engaged in various stages of
    negotiations for a number of acquisitions and other
    transactions, some of which may be significant, that may
    include, but are not limited to, individual properties, large
    multi-property portfolios and platforms and property-owning or
    real-estate-related entities.

Growth
    Through Development

The company’s development business consists of conventional
    development,

build-to-suit

development, redevelopment, value-added conversions and land
    sales. The company believes, over the long term, customer demand
    for new industrial space in strategic markets tied to global
    trade will continue to outpace supply, most notably in major
    gateway markets in Asia, Europe and the Americas. The company
    believes that developing, redeveloping

and/or

expanding of well-located, high-quality industrial properties
    provides higher rates of return than may be obtained from
    purchasing existing properties. However, new developments,
    redevelopments and value-added conversions may require
    significant management attention and capital investment to
    maximize returns. The company pursues development projects
    directly and in co-investment ventures and development joint
    ventures, providing it with the flexibility to pursue
    development projects independently or in partnerships, depending
    on market conditions, submarkets or building sites and
    availability of capital. Completed development and redevelopment
    properties are held in its owned and managed portfolio or sold
    to third parties.

Management believes its long-standing focus on infill locations
    can at times lead to opportunities to enhance value through the
    conversion of some of the company’s industrial properties
    to higher and better uses. Value-added conversion projects
    generally involve a significant enhancement or a change in use
    of the property from an industrial facility to a higher and
    better use, including use as research & development,
    manufacturing, office, residential, or retail properties.
    Activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a
    higher and better use may include rezoning, redesigning,
    reconstructing and re-tenanting. The sales price of a
    value-added conversion project is generally based on the
    underlying land value, reflecting its ultimate conversion to a
    higher and better use and, as such, little to no residual value
    is ascribed to the industrial building. Generally, the company
    expects to sell to third parties these value-added conversion
    projects at some point in the re-entitlement and conversion
    process, thus recognizing the enhanced value of the underlying
    land that supports the property’s repurposed use.

Members of the company’s development team have broad
    experience in real estate development and possess
    multidisciplinary backgrounds that allow for the completion of
    the build-out and

lease-up

of
    the company’s development portfolio. Management believes
    that there are currently opportunities for land entitlement as
    municipalities are beginning to seek revenue generating
    activities.

Proposed
    Merger with ProLogis

On January 30, 2011, the parent company and the operating
    partnership entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
    “merger agreement”) with ProLogis, a Maryland real
    estate investment trust, New Pumpkin Inc., a Maryland
    corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ProLogis, Upper
    Pumpkin LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly
    owned subsidiary of New Pumpkin, and Pumpkin LLC, a Delaware
    limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Upper
    Pumpkin. The merger agreement provides for a merger of equals,
    in which through a series of transactions, ProLogis and its
    newly formed subsidiaries will be merged with and into the
    parent company (the “merger”), with the parent company
    continuing as the surviving corporation with its corporate name
    changed to “ProLogis Inc.” As a result of the mergers,
    each outstanding common share of beneficial interest of ProLogis
    will be converted into the right to receive 0.4464 of a newly
    issued share of common stock of



the parent company. The merger is subject to customary closing
    conditions, including receipt of approval of parent company
    stockholders and ProLogis shareholders.

The merger transactions entail the following steps:
    (1) Pumpkin LLC will be merged with and into ProLogis, with
    ProLogis continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly
    owned subsidiary of Upper Pumpkin; (2) then, New Pumpkin
    will be merged with and into the parent company with the parent
    company continuing as the surviving corporation and its
    corporate name changed, and (3) then, the surviving
    corporation will contribute all of the outstanding equity
    interests of Upper Pumpkin to the operating partnership in
    exchange for the issuance by the operating partnership of
    partnership interests to the surviving corporation. As a result
    of these merger transactions, the combined company will be
    structured as an UPREIT.

The merger agreement provides that, upon the consummation of the
    merger, the board of directors of the surviving corporation will
    consist of 11 members, as follows: (i) Mr. Hamid R.
    Moghadam, the current chief executive officer of the parent
    company, (ii) Mr. Walter C. Rakowich, the current
    chief executive officer of ProLogis, (iii) four individuals
    to be selected by the current members of the board of directors
    of the parent company, and (iv) five individuals to be
    selected by the current members of the board of trustees of
    ProLogis. In addition, upon the consummation of the merger,
    (a) Mr. Moghadam and Mr. Rakowich will become
    co-chief executive officers of the surviving corporation,
    (b) Mr. William E. Sullivan, the current chief
    financial officer of ProLogis, will become the chief financial
    officer of the surviving corporation, (c) Mr. Irving
    F. Lyons, III, a current member of the board of trustees of
    ProLogis, will become the lead independent director of the
    surviving corporation, (d) Mr. Moghadam will become
    the chairman of the board of directors of the surviving
    corporation and (e) Mr. Rakowich will become the
    chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors of
    the surviving corporation.

The merger agreement also provides that, on December 31,
    2012, (i) unless earlier terminated in accordance with the
    bylaws of the surviving corporation, the employment of
    Mr. Rakowich as co-chief executive officer will terminate
    and Mr. Rakowich will thereupon retire as co-chief
    executive officer and as a director of the surviving
    corporation, and Mr. Moghadam will become the sole chief
    executive officer (and will remain the chairman of the board of
    directors) of the surviving corporation, and (ii) unless
    earlier terminated, the employment of Mr. Sullivan as the
    chief financial officer of the surviving corporation will
    terminate and Mr. Thomas S. Olinger, the current chief
    financial officer of the parent company, will become the chief
    financial officer of the surviving corporation.

The parent company and the operating partnership have been named
    as defendants in at least two pending putative shareholder class
    actions filed in connection with the merger of the parent
    company and ProLogis:

James Kinsey, et al. v. ProLogis,
    et al.,

no. 2011CV818, filed on or about
    February 2, 2011 in the Denver County District Court,
    Colorado; and

Vernon C. Burrows, et al. v. ProLogis, et
    al.,

filed on or about February 15, 2011, in the
    Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore City. The complaints
    seek to enjoin the merger, alleging, among other things, that
    ProLogis’ directors and certain executive officers breached
    their fiduciary duties by failing to maximize the value to be
    received by ProLogis shareholders and by improperly considering
    certain directors’ personal interests in the transaction in
    determining whether to enter into the merger agreement. The
    Maryland complaint also includes a derivative claim on behalf of
    ProLogis based upon the same allegations. Both complaints also
    assert a claim of aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary
    duties against ProLogis, the parent company and the merger
    entities. The Colorado complaint also asserts a claim of aiding
    and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties against the operating
    partnership. In addition to an order enjoining the transaction,
    the complaints seek, among other things, attorneys’ fees
    and expenses, and the Maryland complaint further seeks certain
    monetary damages. The parent company and the operating
    partnership view the complaints to be without merit and intend
    to defend against them vigorously.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

BUSINESS
    RISKS

The company’s operations involve various risks that could
    have adverse consequences to it. These risks include, among
    others:

Risks of
    the Current Economic Environment

Disruptions
    in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect
    the company’s business, results of operations, cash flows
    and financial condition.

Global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented
    and challenging with tighter credit conditions, slower growth
    and recession in most major economies during the last two years.
    Although signs of recovery may exist, there are continued
    concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, the
    availability and cost of credit, a declining real estate market,
    and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market
    volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy.
    These conditions, combined with declining business activity
    levels and consumer confidence, increased unemployment and
    volatile oil prices, contributed to unprecedented levels of
    volatility in the capital markets during the last two years. Any
    additional, continued or recurring disruptions in the capital
    and credit markets may adversely affect the company’s
    business, results of operations, cash flows and financial
    condition.

As a result of these market conditions, the cost and
    availability of credit have been and may continue to be
    adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit
    spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally
    and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many
    lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some
    cases, cease to provide funding to businesses and consumers.
    These factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses
    and consumers alike, and a corresponding decrease in global
    infrastructure spending. While the company currently believes
    that it has sufficient working capital and capacity under its
    credit facilities in the near term, continued or recurring
    turbulence in the global markets and economies and prolonged
    declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect
    its liquidity and financial condition, as well as the liquidity
    and financial condition of its customers. If these market
    conditions persist, recur or worsen in the long term, they may
    limit the company’s ability, and the ability of its
    customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities, and access
    the credit markets to meet liquidity needs.

If the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall
    below its current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under its
    unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans may increase.
    In addition, if the long-term debt ratings of the operating
    partnership fall below investment grade, it may be unable to
    request borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or
    Japanese Yen, as applicable; however, the lack of other currency
    borrowings does not affect its ability to fully draw down under
    the credit facilities or term loans. While the operating
    partnership currently does not expect its long-term debt ratings
    to fall below investment grade, in the event that its ratings do
    fall below those levels, it may be unable to exercise its
    options to extend the term of its credit facilities, and the
    loss of its ability to borrow in foreign currencies could affect
    its ability to optimally hedge its borrowings against foreign
    currency exchange rate changes. In addition, the company cannot
    assure you that additional, continuing or recurring long-term
    disruptions in the global economy and the continuation of
    tighter credit conditions among, and potential failures of,
    third-party financial institutions as a result of such
    disruptions will not have an adverse effect on the operating
    partnership’s borrowing capacity and liquidity position.
    The operating partnership’s access to funds under its
    credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the lenders
    that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding
    commitments to the operating partnership. The company cannot
    assure you that if one of the operating partnership’s
    lenders fails (some of whom are lenders under a number of the
    operating partnership’s facilities), the operating
    partnership will be successful in finding a replacement lender
    and, as a result, its borrowing capacity under the applicable
    facilities may be permanently reduced. If the company does not
    have sufficient cash flows and income from its operations to
    meet its financial commitments and those lenders are not able to
    meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership, the
    company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and
    financial condition could be adversely affected.



Certain of the company’s third-party indebtedness is held
    by the company’s consolidated or unconsolidated joint
    ventures. In the event that the company’s joint venture
    partner is unable to meet its obligations under the joint
    venture agreements or the third-party debt agreements, the
    company may elect to pay its joint venture partner’s
    portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the mortgaged property
    or permit the lender to foreclose on the mortgaged property to
    meet the joint venture’s debt obligations. In either case,
    the company could face a loss of income and asset value on the
    property.

There can be no assurance that the markets will stabilize in the
    near future or that the company will choose to or be able to
    increase its levels of capital deployment at such time or ever.
    In addition, a continued increase in the cost of credit and
    inability to access the capital and credit markets may adversely
    impact the occupancy of the company’s properties, the
    disposition of its properties, private capital raising and
    contribution of properties to its co-investment ventures. For
    example, an inability to fully lease the company’s
    properties may result in such properties not meeting the
    company’s investment criteria for contributions to its
    co-investment ventures. If the company is unable to contribute
    completed development properties to its co-investment ventures
    or sell its completed development projects to third parties, the
    company will not be able to recognize gains from the
    contribution or sale of such properties and, as a result, the
    net income available to the parent company’s common
    stockholders and its funds from operations will decrease.
    Additionally, business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns
    and other similar factors that affect the company’s
    customers may adversely impact its business and financial
    condition. Furthermore, general uncertainty in the real estate
    markets has resulted in conditions where the pricing of certain
    real estate assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with
    respect to capitalization rates and valuations, among other
    things, which may add to the difficulty of buyers or the
    company’s co-investment ventures to obtain financing on
    favorable terms to acquire such properties or cause potential
    buyers to not complete acquisitions of such properties. The
    market uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and real
    estate valuations also adversely impacts the company’s net
    asset value. In addition, the operating partnership may face
    difficulty in refinancing its mortgage debt, or may be unable to
    refinance such debt at all, if its property values significantly
    decline. Such a decline may also cause a default under the

loan-to-value

covenants in some of the company’s joint ventures’
    mortgage debt, which may require its joint ventures to re-margin
    or pay down a portion of the applicable debt. There can be no
    assurance, however, that in such an event, the company will be
    able to do so to prevent foreclosure.

In the event that the company does not have sufficient cash
    available to it through its operations to continue operating its
    business as usual, the company may need to find alternative ways
    to increase its liquidity. Such alternatives may include,
    without limitation, divesting itself of properties, whether or
    not they otherwise meet the company’s strategic objectives
    to keep in the long term, at less than optimal terms; issuing
    and selling its debt and equity in public or private
    transactions under less than optimal conditions; entering into
    leases with its customers at lower rental rates or less than
    optimal terms; or entering into lease renewals with its existing
    customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover. There
    can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to
    increase the company’s liquidity will be available to the
    company. Additionally, taking such measures to increase the
    company’s liquidity may adversely affect its business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

As of December 31, 2010, the company had
    $198.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. The
    company’s available cash and cash equivalents are held in
    accounts managed by third-party financial institutions and
    consist of invested cash and cash in its operating accounts. The
    invested cash is invested in money market funds that invest
    solely in direct obligations of the government of the United
    States or in time deposits with certain financial institutions.
    To date, the company has experienced no loss or lack of access
    to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however, the company
    can provide no assurances that access to its invested cash and
    cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in
    the financial markets.

At any point in time, the company also has a significant amount
    of cash deposits in its operating accounts that are with
    third-party financial institutions, and, as of December 31,
    2010, the amount in such deposits was approximately
    $171.3 million on a consolidated basis. These balances
    exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance
    limits. While the company monitors daily the cash balances in
    its operating accounts and adjusts the cash balances as
    appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the
    underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other
    adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, the
    company has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its
    operating accounts.



The
    price per share of the parent company’s stock may decline
    or fluctuate significantly.

The market price per share of the parent company’s common
    stock may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many
    factors, including:

•

general market and economic conditions;

•

actual or anticipated variations in the parent company’s
    operating results or dividends or the parent company’s
    payment of dividends in shares of its stock;

•

changes in its funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•

difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or
    refinance existing debt;

•

breaches of covenants and defaults under the operating
    partnership’s credit facilities and other debt;

•

Risks
    Related to Our Proposed Merger Transaction with
    ProLogis

We
    will be subject to various uncertainties and contractual
    restrictions while the merger is pending that could adversely
    affect our financial results.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees,
    suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These
    uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and
    motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a
    period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers
    and others who deal with us to



seek to change existing business relationships. Employee
    retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior
    to completion of the merger, as employees and prospective
    employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles
    with the combined company.

The pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the
    integration may place a significant burden on management and
    internal resources. Any significant diversion of management
    attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties
    encountered in the transition and integration process could
    affect our financial results.

In addition, the merger agreement restricts us, without
    ProLogis’ consent, from making certain acquisitions and
    dispositions, from engaging in certain capital raising
    transactions and taking other specified actions while the merger
    is pending. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing
    attractive business opportunities and making other changes to
    our business prior to completion of the merger or termination of
    the merger agreement.

Pending
    litigation against AMB and ProLogis could result in an
    injunction preventing completion of the merger and the payment
    of damages in the event the merger is completed and/or may
    adversely affect our company’s business, financial
    condition or results of operation before the merger and/or the
    combined company’s business, financial condition or results
    of operations following the merger.

In connection with the merger, purported stockholders of
    ProLogis have filed two putative stockholder class action
    lawsuits against us and ProLogis, among others. Among other
    remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the merger. We may be
    subject to additional stockholder class action lawsuits during
    the pendency of the merger. If a final settlement is not
    reached, these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the
    merger and result in substantial costs to us, including any
    costs associated with the indemnification of directors. The
    defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains
    unresolved may adversely affect our business, financial
    condition or results of operations

and/or

the
    combined company’s business, financial condition or results
    of operations.

We may
    be unable to obtain in the anticipated timeframe, or at all,
    satisfaction of all conditions to complete the merger or, in
    order to do so, we may be required to comply with material
    restrictions or conditions that may negatively affect the
    combined company after the merger is completed or cause us to
    abandon the merger. Failure to complete the merger could
    negatively affect our future business and financial
    results.

Completion of the merger is contingent upon, among other things,
    receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the absence of any
    injunction prohibiting the merger. All required regulatory
    authorizations, approvals or consents may not be obtained or may
    contain terms, conditions or restrictions that will be
    detrimental to the combined company after completion of the
    merger.

The stockholders of both AMB and ProLogis must approve the
    merger transaction at special stockholder meetings to be held
    after our merger proxy and registration statement is effective.
    If the stockholders of either company do not approve the merger,
    the merger will not be consummated.

In addition, satisfying the conditions to, and completion of,
    the merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, we
    expect. Any delay in completing or any additional conditions
    imposed in order to complete the merger may materially adversely
    affect the synergies and other benefits that we and ProLogis
    expect to achieve from the merger and the integration of our
    businesses.

We may be unable to satisfy all the conditions to the merger or
    succeed in any litigation brought in connection with the merger.
    If the merger is not completed, our financial results may be
    adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks,
    including but not limited to:

•

payment to ProLogis of a termination fee of $210 million,
    as specified in the merger agreement, depending on the nature of
    the termination;

•

payment of costs relating to the merger, whether or not the
    merger is completed; and

•

being subject to litigation related to any failure to complete
    the merger.



Any delay or inability to satisfy all conditions to complete the
    merger, or failure to complete the merger could negatively
    affect our future business, financial condition or results of
    operation.

If
    completed, the merger may not achieve its intended results, and
    we and ProLogis may be unable to successfully integrate our
    operations.

We and ProLogis entered into the merger agreement with the
    expectation that the merger will result in various benefits,
    including, among other things, cost savings and operating
    efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger
    is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the
    businesses of AMB and ProLogis can be integrated in an efficient
    and effective manner.

If the merger is completed, it is possible that the integration
    process could take longer than anticipated and could result in
    the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of each
    company’s ongoing businesses, processes and systems or
    inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices,
    policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could
    adversely affect the combined company’s ability to achieve
    the anticipated benefits of the merger. The combined
    company’s results of operations could also be adversely
    affected by any issues attributable to either company’s
    operations that arise or are based on events or actions that
    occur prior to the closing of the merger. The companies may have
    difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures
    and management philosophies. The integration process is subject
    to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that
    the anticipated benefits will be realized or, if realized, the
    timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these
    anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or
    decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely
    affect the combined company’s future business, results of
    operations, financial condition and prospects.

Debt
    Financing Risks

The
    company faces risks associated with the use of debt to fund its
    business activities, including refinancing and interest rate
    risks.

As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had
    total debt outstanding of $3.3 billion. As of
    December 31, 2010, the parent company guaranteed
    $1.7 billion of the operating partnership’s
    obligations with respect to the senior debt securities
    referenced in the parent company’s financial statements.
    The operating partnership is subject to risks normally
    associated with debt financing, including the risk that its cash
    flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal
    and interest. It is likely that the operating partnership will
    need to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as
    it matures. There is a risk that the operating partnership may
    not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any
    refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of its
    existing debt. If the operating partnership is unable to
    refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay
    them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then the
    operating partnership expects that its cash flow will not be
    sufficient in all years to repay all such maturing debt and to
    pay distributions to its unitholders, including the parent
    company, which, in turn, will be unable to pay cash dividends to
    its stockholders. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or
    other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher
    interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense
    relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Higher
    interest rates on newly incurred debt may negatively impact the
    operating partnership as well. If interest rates increase, the
    operating partnership’s interest costs and overall costs of
    capital will increase, which could adversely affect its
    financial condition, results of operation and cash flow, the
    market price of the parent company’s stock, the operating
    partnership’s ability to pay principal and interest on its
    debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders, the parent
    company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders
    and the operating partnership’s capital deployment
    activity. In addition, there may be circumstances that will
    require the operating partnership to obtain amendments or
    waivers to provisions in its credit facilities or other
    financings. There can be no assurance that the operating
    partnership will be able to obtain necessary amendments or
    waivers at all or without significant expense. In such case, the
    operating partnership may not be able to fund its business
    activities as planned, within budget or at all.

In addition, if the company mortgages one or more of its
    properties to secure payment of indebtedness and the company is
    unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be
    foreclosed upon or transferred to the lender with a consequent
    loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of
    the company’s properties could adversely affect its
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay distributions to the



operating partnership’s unitholders and cash dividends to
    the parent company’s stockholders, and the market price of
    the parent company’s stock.

As of December 31, 2010, the company had outstanding bank
    guarantees in the amount of $0.3 million used to secure
    contingent obligations, primarily obligations under development
    and purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2010, the
    company also guaranteed $58.6 million and
    $83.5 million on outstanding loans for five of its
    consolidated co-investment ventures and three of its
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures, respectively. Also, the
    company has entered into contribution agreements with certain of
    its unconsolidated co-investment venture funds. These
    contribution agreements require the company to make additional
    capital contributions to the applicable co-investment venture
    fund upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of its
    debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital
    contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than the company’s share of the co-investment
    venture’s debt obligation or the value of the
    company’s share of any property securing such debt. The
    company’s contribution obligations under these agreements
    will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the
    fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the
    debt and obtained by the lender upon default. The company’s
    potential obligations under these contribution agreements were
    $260.6 million as of December 31, 2010. The company
    intends to continue to guarantee debt of its unconsolidated
    co-investment venture funds and make additional contributions to
    its unconsolidated co-investment venture funds in connection
    with property contributions to the funds. Such payment
    obligations under such guarantees and contribution obligations
    under such contribution agreements, if required to be paid,
    could be of a magnitude that could adversely affect the
    company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash
    flow and ability to pay cash dividends to the parent
    company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the
    parent company’s stock.

Adverse
    changes in the company’s credit ratings could negatively
    affect its financing activity.

The credit ratings of the operating partnership’s senior
    unsecured long-term debt and the parent company’s preferred
    stock are based on its operating performance, liquidity and
    leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors
    employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses
    of the company. The company’s credit ratings can affect the
    amount of capital it can access, as well as the terms and
    pricing of any debt the operating partnership may incur. In
    addition, the announcement of the proposed merger transaction
    with ProLogis resulted in the company being placed on a negative
    credit rating watch list and because ProLogis’ credit
    rating is lower than the company’s, the credit rating of
    the combined company may be adversely affected if the proposed
    merger is completed. There can be no assurance that the company
    will be able to maintain its current credit ratings, and in the
    event its current credit ratings are downgraded, the company
    would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter
    difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade
    in the company’s credit ratings may trigger additional
    payments or other negative consequences under its current and
    future credit facilities and debt instruments. For example, if
    the operating partnership’s credit ratings of its senior
    unsecured long-term debt are downgraded to below investment
    grade levels, the operating partnership may not be able to
    obtain or maintain extensions on certain of its existing debt.
    Adverse changes in the operating partnership’s credit
    ratings could negatively impact its refinancing and other
    capital market activities, its ability to manage its debt
    maturities, its future growth, its financial condition, the
    market price of the parent company’s stock, and its
    development and acquisition activity.

Covenants
    in the operating partnership’s debt agreements could
    adversely affect its financial condition.

The terms of the operating partnership’s credit agreements
    and other indebtedness require that it complies with a number of
    financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service
    coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.
    These covenants may limit flexibility in the operating
    partnership’s operations, and its failure to comply with
    these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt
    agreement even if it has satisfied its payment obligations. As
    of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had certain
    non-recourse, secured loans, which are cross-collateralized by
    multiple properties. If the operating partnership defaults on
    any of these loans, it may then be required to repay such
    indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to
    avoid foreclosure on all the cross-collateralized properties
    within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on the operating
    partnership’s properties, or its inability to refinance its
    loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact its financial



condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders or
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders,
    and the market price of the parent company’s stock. In
    addition, the operating partnership’s credit facilities and
    senior debt securities contain certain cross-default provisions,
    which are triggered in the event that its other material
    indebtedness is in default. These cross-default provisions may
    require the operating partnership to repay or restructure the
    credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to
    any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could
    adversely affect the operating partnership’s financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    distributions to its unitholders and the parent company’s
    ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market
    price of its stock.

Failure
    to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rates may
    adversely affect results of operations.

The company seeks to manage its exposure to exchange and
    interest rate volatility by using exchange and interest rate
    hedging arrangements, such as cap agreements and swap
    agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk
    that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations
    under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be
    effective in reducing the company’s exposure to exchange or
    interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such
    agreements are not legally enforceable. Hedging may reduce
    overall returns on the company’s investments. Failure to
    hedge effectively against exchange and interest rate changes may
    materially adversely affect the company’s results of
    operations.

The
    company is dependent on external sources of
    capital.

In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the
    parent company is required each year to distribute to its
    stockholders at least 90% of its real estate investment trust
    taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid
    deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and is subject
    to tax to the extent its income is not fully distributed. While
    historically the parent company has satisfied these distribution
    requirements by making cash distributions to its stockholders,
    the parent company may choose to satisfy these requirements by
    making distributions of cash or other property, including, in
    limited circumstances, its own stock. For distributions with
    respect to taxable years ending on or before December 31,
    2011, and in some cases declared as late as December 31,
    2012, the parent company can satisfy up to 90% of the
    distribution requirements discussed above through the
    distribution of shares of its stock if certain conditions are
    met. Assuming the parent company continues to satisfy these
    distribution requirements with cash, the parent company and the
    operating partnership may not be able to fund all future capital
    needs, including acquisition and development activities, from
    cash retained from operations and may have to rely on
    third-party sources of capital. Further, in order to maintain
    the parent company’s real estate investment trust status
    and avoid the payment of federal income and excise taxes, the
    parent company, through the operating partnership, may need to
    borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the real estate
    investment trust distribution requirements even if the
    then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these
    borrowings. These short-term borrowing needs could result from
    differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and
    inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the
    effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of
    reserves or required debt or amortization payments. The
    company’s ability to access private debt and equity capital
    on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of
    factors, including general market conditions, the market’s
    perception of the company’s growth potential, its current
    and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the
    market price of its securities.

The
    operating partnership could incur more debt, increasing its debt
    service.

As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership’s
    share of total

debt-to-its

share of total market capitalization ratio was 41.3%. The
    operating partnership’s definition of “the operating
    partnership’s share of total market capitalization” is
    the operating partnership’s share of total debt plus
    preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See
    footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table contained in
    Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operation — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for
    the operating partnership’s definitions of “market
    equity” and “the operating partnership’s share of
    total debt.” As this ratio percentage increases directly
    with a decrease in the market price per share of the parent
    company’s capital stock, an unstable market environment
    will impact this ratio in a volatile manner. There can also



be no assurance that the operating partnership would not become
    more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service
    that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution
    to its unitholders and, in turn, the cash available to
    distribute to the parent company’s stockholders.
    Furthermore, if the operating partnership becomes more highly
    leveraged, the operating partnership may not be in compliance
    with the debt covenants contained in the agreements governing
    its co-investment ventures, which could adversely impact its
    private capital business.

Other
    Real Estate Industry Risks

The
    company’s performance and value are subject to general
    economic conditions and risks associated with its real estate
    assets.

The investment returns available from equity investments in real
    estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital
    appreciation generated by the properties, as well as the
    expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If the
    company’s properties do not generate income sufficient to
    meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital
    expenditures, then the operating partnership’s ability to
    pay distributions to its unitholders (including the parent
    company) and, in turn, the parent company’s ability to pay
    cash dividends to its stockholders could be adversely affected.
    In addition, there are significant expenditures associated with
    an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real
    estate taxes and maintenance costs) that generally do not
    decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property.
    Income from, and the value of, the company’s properties may
    be adversely affected by:

•

changes in the general economic climate, such as the current
    one, including diminished access to or availability of capital
    (including difficulties in financing, refinancing and extending
    existing debt) and rising inflation (see “Risks of the
    Current Economic Environment”);

•

local conditions, such as oversupply of or a reduction in demand
    for industrial space;

•

the attractiveness of the company’s properties to potential
    customers;

•

competition from other properties;

•

the company’s ability to provide adequate maintenance and
    insurance;

•

increased operating costs;

•

increased cost of compliance with regulations;

•

the potential for liability under applicable laws (including
    changes in tax laws); and

•

disruptions in the global supply chain caused by political,
    regulatory or other factors, including terrorism.

In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession in the
    United States and in other countries, rising interest rates,
    diminished access to or availability of capital or declining
    demand for real estate, may result in a general decrease in
    rents, an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases
    or greater difficulty in financing the company’s
    acquisition and development activities, which would adversely
    affect the company’s financial condition and results of
    operations. Future terrorist attacks may result in declining
    economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and the
    value of the company’s properties. To the extent that
    future attacks impact the company’s customers, their
    businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including
    their ability to continue to honor their existing leases.

The company’s properties are concentrated predominantly in
    the industrial real estate sector. As a result of this
    concentration, the company feels the impact of an economic
    downturn in this sector more acutely than if the company’s
    portfolio included other property types.

The
    company may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or
    relet space as leases expire.

As of December 31, 2010, on an owned and managed basis, the
    company’s occupancy average was 91.2%

year-to-date

and the leases on 16.4% of the company’s industrial
    properties (based on annualized base rent) will expire on or
    prior to December 31, 2011. The company derives most of its
    income from rent received from its customers. Accordingly, the
    company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash
    flow and its ability to pay



dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders,
    and the market price of the parent company’s stock could be
    adversely affected if the company is unable to lease vacant
    space at favorable rents or terms or at all and to promptly
    relet or renew expiring leases or if the rental rates upon
    leasing, renewal or reletting are significantly lower than
    expected. There can be no assurance that the company will be
    able to lease its vacant space, renew its expiring leases,
    increase its occupancy to its historical averages or generally
    realize the potential of its currently low-yielding assets
    (including the build-out and leasing of its development
    platform). Periods of economic slowdown or recession are likely
    to adversely affect the company’s leasing activities. If a
    customer experiences a downturn in its business or other type of
    financial distress, then it may be unable to make timely rental
    payments or renew its lease. Further, the company’s ability
    to rent space and the rents that it can charge are impacted, not
    only by customer demand, but by the number of other properties
    the company has to compete with to appeal to customers.

The
    company could be adversely affected if a significant number of
    its customers are unable to meet their lease
    obligations.

The company’s results of operations, distributable cash
    flow and the value of the parent company’s stock would be
    adversely affected if a significant number of the company’s
    customers were unable to meet their lease obligations. In the
    current economic environment, it is likely that customer
    bankruptcies will increase. If a customer seeks the protection
    of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, such customer’s
    lease may be terminated in the process and result in a reduction
    of cash flow to the company. In the event of a significant
    number of lease defaults

and/or

tenant bankruptcies, the company’s cash flow may not be
    sufficient to pay distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders and cash dividends to the parent
    company’s stockholders and repay maturing debt and any
    other obligations. As of December 31, 2010, on an owned and
    managed basis, the company did not have any single customer
    account for annualized base rent revenues greater than 3.1%.
    However, in the event of lease defaults by a significant number
    of the company’s customers, the company may incur
    substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlord.

Declining
    real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely
    affect the company’s earnings and financial
    condition.

The economic downturn has generally resulted in lower real
    estate valuations, which has required the company to recognize
    real estate impairment charges on its assets. The company
    conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes
    in accordance with its policy of accounting for the impairment
    or disposal of long-lived assets, which indicates that asset
    values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may
    not be fully recoverable. The intended use of an asset, either
    held for sale or held for the long term, can significantly
    impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is intended to be
    held for the long term, the impairment analysis is based on a
    two-step test. The first test measures estimated expected future
    cash flows over the holding period, including a residual value
    (undiscounted and without interest charges), against the
    carrying value of the property. If the asset fails the first
    test, then the asset carrying value is measured against the
    estimated fair value from a market participant standpoint, with
    the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated
    fair value recognized as an impairment charge to earnings. If an
    asset is intended to be sold, impairment is tested based on a
    one-step test, comparing the carrying value to the estimated
    fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of expected future
    net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions
    regarding current and future economic and market conditions and
    the availability of capital. The company determines the
    estimated fair values based on assumptions regarding rental
    rates, costs to complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values.
    The company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams
    and the recent valuations of its two open-ended funds, which
    contain a large, geographically diversified pool of assets, all
    of which are subject to third-party appraisals on at least an
    annual basis. As a result of changing market conditions, the
    company may need to re-evaluate the carrying value of its
    investments and recognize real estate impairment losses on
    certain of its investments.

The principal trigger which has led to impairment charges in the
    recent past was the severe economic deterioration in some
    markets resulting in a decrease in leasing and rental rates,
    rising vacancies and an increase in capitalization rates.
    Impairments may be necessary in the future in the event that
    market conditions deteriorate and



impact the factors used to estimate fair value, which may
    include impairments relating to the company’s
    unconsolidated real estate as well as impairments relating to
    the company’s investments in its unconsolidated
    co-investment ventures. Investments in unconsolidated joint
    ventures are presented under the equity method. The equity
    method is used when the company has the ability to exercise
    significant influence over operating and financial policies of
    the joint venture but does not have control of the joint
    venture. Under the equity method, these investments are
    initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are
    subsequently adjusted to reflect the company’s
    proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint
    venture, distributions received, contributions, deferred gains
    from the contribution of properties and certain other
    adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there
    may have been a loss in value of an equity investment, the
    company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating
    the company’s ability to recover its investment or if the
    loss in value is other than temporary. To evaluate whether an
    impairment is other than temporary, the company considers
    relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the period of
    time in any unrealized loss position, the likelihood of a future
    recovery, and the company’s positive intent and ability to
    hold the investment until the forecasted recovery. If the
    company determines the loss in value is other than temporary,
    the company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the
    investment at fair value. Fair value is determined through
    various valuation techniques, including, but not limited to,
    discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third
    party appraisals. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    the company did not record any impairment on its investments in
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. There can be no assurance
    that the estimates and assumptions the company uses to assess
    impairments are accurate and will reflect actual results. A
    worsening real estate market may cause the company to reevaluate
    the assumptions used in its impairment analysis and its intent
    to hold, sell, develop or contribute properties. Impairment
    charges could adversely affect the company’s financial
    condition, results of operations and its ability to pay cash
    dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders
    and the market price of the parent company’s stock.

The
    company’s performance and value are impacted by the local
    economic conditions of and the risks associated with doing
    business in California.

As of December 31, 2010, the company’s industrial
    properties located in California represented 21.1% of the
    aggregate square footage of its industrial operating properties
    and 19.7% of its industrial annualized base rent, on an owned
    and managed basis. The company’s revenue from, and the
    value of, its properties located in California may be affected
    by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or
    reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic
    climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns,
    changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact
    California’s economic climate. Because of the number of
    properties the company has located in California, a downturn in
    California’s economy or real estate conditions could
    adversely affect the company’s financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to
    its stockholders and the market price of its stock.

A number of the company’s properties are located in areas
    that are known to be subject to earthquake activity.
    U.S. properties located in active seismic areas include
    properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and
    Seattle. The company’s largest concentration of such
    properties is in California where, on an owned and managed
    basis, as of December 31, 2010, the company had 277
    industrial buildings, aggregating approximately
    29.9 million square feet, on an owned and managed basis.
    International properties located in active seismic areas include
    Tokyo and Osaka, Japan and Mexico City, Mexico. The company
    carries earthquake insurance on all of its properties located in
    areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to
    coverage limitations and deductibles that it believes are
    commercially reasonable. The company evaluates its earthquake
    insurance coverage annually in light of current industry
    practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants.

The
    company may be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous
    terms or at all or acquisitions may not perform as it
    expects.

On a strategic and selective basis, the company may acquire
    U.S. or foreign properties, portfolios of properties or
    interests in property-owning or real-estate related entities and
    platforms, which could include large acquisitions that could
    increase the company’s size and alter its capital and
    organizational structure. Such acquisitions entail various
    risks, including the risks that the company’s investments
    may not perform or be accretive to the company’s



value as it expects, that it may be unable to quickly and
    efficiently integrate its new acquisitions into its existing
    operations or, if applicable, contribute the acquired properties
    to a joint venture, that portfolio acquisitions may include
    non-core assets, that the new investments may come with
    unexpected liabilities and that the company’s cost
    estimates for developing or bringing an acquired property up to
    market standards may prove inaccurate. The company may not be
    able to acquire assets at values above the company’s cost
    of capital. In addition, the company expects to finance future
    acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under its
    unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from private or public
    equity or debt offerings (including issuances of operating
    partnership units) and proceeds from property divestitures,
    which may not be available at favorable pricing or at all and
    which could adversely affect the company’s cash flow.
    Further, the company faces significant competition for
    attractive investment opportunities from other real estate
    investors, including both publicly-traded real estate investment
    trusts and private institutional investors and funds. This
    competition increases as quality investment opportunities arise
    at favorable pricing and investments in real estate become
    increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment.
    As a result of competition, the company may be unable to make
    additional investments as it desires or the purchase price of
    the investments may be significantly elevated. Also, the company
    may incur significant transaction-related costs in exploring and
    pursuing potential transactions it may not consummate. Any of
    the above risks could adversely affect the company’s
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the
    ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders, and the market price of the
    parent company’s stock.

The
    company is subject to risks and liabilities in connection with
    forming new joint ventures, investing in new or existing joint
    ventures, attracting third party investment and owning
    properties through joint ventures and other investment
    vehicles.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 91.4 million
    square feet of the company’s properties were held through
    joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with
    third parties. The company’s organizational documents do
    not limit the amount of available funds that it may invest in
    partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures, and
    the company may and currently intends to develop and acquire
    properties through joint ventures, limited liability companies,
    partnerships with and investments in other entities when
    warranted by the circumstances. However, there can be no
    assurance that the company will be able to form new joint
    ventures, attract third party investment or make additional
    investments in new or existing joint ventures, successfully
    develop or acquire properties through such joint ventures, or
    realize value from such joint ventures. The company’s
    inability to do so may have an adverse effect on the
    company’s growth, its earnings and the market price of the
    parent company’s securities.

Joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over
    major decisions and some partners may manage the properties in
    the joint venture investments. Joint venture investments involve
    certain risks, including:

•

if the company’s joint venture partners go bankrupt, then
    the company and any other remaining partners may generally
    remain liable for the investment’s liabilities;

•

if the company’s joint venture partners fail to fund their
    share of any required capital contributions, then the company
    may choose to or be required to contribute such capital;

•

the company may, under certain circumstances, guarantee all or a
    portion of the joint venture’s debt, which may require the
    company to pay an amount greater than its investment in the
    joint venture;

•

the company’s joint venture partners might have economic or
    other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the
    company’s business interests or goals that would affect the
    company’s ability to operate the property;

•

the company’s joint venture partners may have the power to
    act contrary to the company’s instructions, requests,
    policies or objectives, including its current policy with
    respect to maintaining the parent company’s qualification
    as a real estate investment trust;

•

the joint venture or other governing agreements often restrict
    the transfer of an interest in the joint venture or may
    otherwise restrict the company’s ability to sell the
    interest when it desires or on advantageous terms;



•

the company’s relationships with its joint venture partners
    are generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or
    dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event,
    the company may not continue to own or operate the interests or
    assets underlying such relationship or may need to purchase such
    interests or assets at an above-market price to continue
    ownership;

•

disputes between the company and its joint venture partners may
    result in litigation or arbitration that would increase the
    company’s expenses and prevent its officers and directors
    from focusing their time and effort on the company’s
    business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the
    applicable joint venture to additional risk; and

•

the company may in certain circumstances be liable for the
    actions of its joint venture partners.

The company generally seeks to maintain sufficient control or
    influence over its joint ventures to permit it to achieve its
    business objectives; however, the company may not be able to do
    so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described
    above could adversely affect the company’s financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders
    and the market price of the parent company’s stock.

The
    company may not be successful in contributing properties to its
    co-investment ventures.

The company may contribute or sell properties to certain of its
    co-investment ventures on a

case-by-case

basis. However, the company may fail to contribute properties to
    its co-investment ventures due to such factors as its inability
    to acquire, develop, or lease properties that meet the
    investment criteria of such ventures, or its co-investment
    ventures’ inability to access debt and equity capital to
    pay for property contributions or their allocation of available
    capital to cover other capital requirements such as forward
    commitments, loan maturities and future redemptions. If the
    co-investment ventures are unable to raise additional capital on
    favorable terms after available capital is depleted or if the
    value of properties to be contributed or sold to the
    co-investment ventures are appraised at less than the cost of
    such properties, then such contributions or sales could be
    delayed or prevented, adversely affecting the company’s
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders, and the market price of the
    parent company’s stock.

A delay in these contributions could result in adverse effects
    on the company’s liquidity and on its ability to meet
    projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period,
    which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results
    of operations, distributable cash flow and the value of its
    securities.

The
    company may be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous
    terms or at all.

The company may divest itself of properties, which are currently
    in its portfolio, are held for sale or which otherwise do not
    meet its strategic objectives. The company may, in certain
    circumstances, divest itself of properties to increase its
    liquidity or to capitalize on opportunities that arise. The
    company’s ability to dispose of properties on advantageous
    terms or at all depends on factors beyond its control, including
    competition from other sellers, current market conditions
    (including capitalization rates applicable to its properties)
    and the availability of financing for potential buyers of its
    properties. If the company is unable to dispose of properties on
    favorable terms or at all or redeploy the proceeds of property
    divestitures in accordance with its investment strategy, then
    the company’s financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow, ability to meet its debt obligations in a timely
    manner and the ability to pay cash dividends and distributions
    could be adversely affected, which could also negatively impact
    the market price of the parent company’s stock.

Actions
    by the company’s competitors may affect the company’s
    ability to divest properties and may decrease or prevent
    increases of the occupancy and rental rates of the
    company’s properties.

The company competes with other owners, operators and developers
    of real estate, some of which own properties similar to the
    company’s properties in the same submarkets in which the
    company’s properties are located. If the company’s
    competitors sell assets similar to assets the company intends to
    divest in the same markets

and/or

at
    valuations below the company’s valuations for comparable
    assets, the company may be unable to divest its



assets at favorable pricing or on favorable terms or at all. In
    addition, if the company’s competitors offer space at
    rental rates below current market rates or below the rental
    rates the company currently charges its customers, the company
    may lose potential customers, and the company may be pressured
    to reduce its rental rates below those the company currently
    charges in order to retain customers when its customers’
    leases expire. As a result, the company’s financial
    condition, cash flow, cash available for distributions and
    dividends and, trading price of the parent company’s stock
    and ability to satisfy the operating partnership’s debt
    service obligations could be materially adversely affected.

The
    company may be unable to complete renovation, development and
    redevelopment projects on advantageous terms or at
    all.

On a strategic and selective basis, the company may develop,
    renovate and redevelop properties. After the financial and real
    estate markets stabilize, the company may expand its investment
    in its development, renovation and redevelopment business and
    complete the build-out and leasing of its development platform.
    The company may also develop, renovate and redevelop properties
    in newly formed development joint ventures into which the
    company may contribute assets. The real estate development,
    renovation and redevelopment business involves significant risks
    that could adversely affect the company’s financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders
    and the market price of the parent company’s stock, which
    include the following risks:

•

the company may not be able to obtain financing for development
    projects on favorable terms or at all and complete construction
    on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt
    service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing the
    properties, generating cash flow and, if applicable,
    contributing properties to a joint venture;

•

the company may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays
    in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building,
    occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations;

•

the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing
    cash flow below budgeted amounts;

•

the company may not be able to lease properties on favorable
    terms or at all;

•

construction costs, total investment amounts and the
    company’s share of remaining funding may exceed the
    company’s estimates and projects may not be completed,
    delivered or stabilized as planned;

•

the company may not be able to attract third party investment in
    new development joint ventures or sufficient customer demand for
    its product;

•

the company may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced
    value created by its value-added conversion projects on its
    expected timetables or at all;

•

the company may not be able to successfully form development
    joint ventures or capture value from such newly formed ventures;

•

the company may fail to contribute properties to its
    co-investment ventures due to such factors as its inability to
    acquire, develop, or lease properties that meet the investment
    criteria of such ventures, or its

co-investment

ventures’ inability to access debt and equity capital to
    pay for property contributions or their allocation of available
    capital to cover other capital requirements such as future
    redemptions;

•

the company may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if
    there is public opposition to its activities;

•

substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment
    activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically
    require a significant amount of management’s time and
    attention, diverting their attention from the company’s

day-to-day

operations; and

•

upon completion of construction, the company may not be able to
    obtain, on advantageous terms or at all, permanent financing for
    activities that it has financed through construction loans.



Real
    estate investments are relatively illiquid, making it difficult
    for the company to respond promptly to changing
    conditions.

Real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of
    assets. Further, the Internal Revenue Code regulates the number
    of properties that the parent company, as a real estate
    investment trust, can dispose of in a year, their tax bases and
    the cost of improvements that the parent company makes to the
    properties. In addition, a portion of the properties held
    directly or indirectly by certain of the company’s
    subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for limited
    partnership units in the applicable partnership. The
    contribution agreements for such properties may contain
    restrictions on certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions
    of these properties, or a portion thereof, which result in a
    taxable transaction for specified periods, following the
    contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership.
    These limitations may affect the company’s ability to sell
    properties. This lack of liquidity and the Internal Revenue Code
    restrictions may limit the company’s ability to vary its
    portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other
    conditions and, as a result, could adversely affect the
    company’s financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flow, the market price of the parent company’s stock,
    the ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders, and the operating
    partnership’s ability to access capital necessary to meet
    its debt payments and other obligations.

Risks
    Associated with the Company’s International
    Business

The
    company’s international activities are subject to special
    risks and it may not be able to effectively manage its
    international business.

The company acquired and developed, and may continue to acquire
    and develop on a strategic and selective basis, properties and
    operating platforms outside the United States. Because local
    markets affect the company’s operations, the company’s
    international investments are subject to economic fluctuations
    in the international locations in which the company invests.
    Access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on
    favorable terms or at all, in certain locations. In addition,
    the company’s international operations are subject to the
    usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax
    treaties or other laws and regulations, including those
    governing the taxation of the company’s international
    revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain
    parts of the world, uncertainty over property rights, terrorist
    or gang-related activities, civil unrest and political
    instability. The company cannot predict the likelihood that any
    of these developments may occur. Further, the company has
    entered, and may in the future enter, into agreements with

non-U.S. entities

that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute
    resolution in the courts of, another country or region. The
    company cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would
    provide it with an effective and efficient means of resolving
    disputes that may arise. Further, even if the company is able to
    obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court
    proceeding, the company could have difficulty enforcing any
    award or judgment on a timely basis or at all.

The company also has offices in many countries outside the
    United States and, as a result, the company’s operations
    may be subject to risks that may limit its ability to
    effectively establish, staff and manage its offices outside the
    United States, including:

•

differing employment practices and labor issues;

•

local business and cultural factors that differ from the
    company’s usual standards and practices;

•

regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between
    jurisdictions; and

•

health concerns.

The company’s global growth (including growth in new
    regions in the United States) subjects the company to certain
    risks, including risks associated with funding increasing
    headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective
    controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new
    offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, payroll expenses are
    paid in local currencies and, therefore, the company is exposed
    to risks associated with fluctuations in the rate of exchange
    between the U.S. dollar and these currencies.

Further, the company’s business has grown rapidly and may
    continue to grow in a strategic and deliberate manner. If the
    proposed merger with ProLogis is completed, the risks associated
    with the combined company’s



international business will be enhanced due to the combined
    company’s larger international presence. If the company
    fails to effectively manage its international growth or
    integrate the combined company’s international operations
    in the event the merger is completed, then the company’s
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders, and the market price of the
    parent company’s stock could be adversely affected.

The
    company is subject to risks from potential fluctuations in
    exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the
    other countries in which it invests.

The company may pursue growth opportunities in international
    markets on a strategic and selective basis. As the company
    invests in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the
    national currency, the company is subject to international
    currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates
    between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other
    countries. A significant depreciation in the value of the
    currency of one or more countries where the company has a
    significant investment may materially affect its results of
    operations. The company attempts to mitigate any such effects by
    borrowing in the currency of the country in which it is
    investing and, under certain circumstances, by putting in place
    international currency put option contracts to hedge exchange
    rate fluctuations. For leases denominated in international
    currencies, the company may use derivative financial instruments
    to manage the international currency exchange risk. The company
    cannot assure you, however, that its efforts will successfully
    neutralize all international currency risks.

Acquired
    properties may be located in new markets, where the company may
    face risks associated with investing in an unfamiliar
    market.

The company has acquired and may continue to acquire properties,
    portfolios of properties, interests in real-estate related
    entities or platforms on a strategic and selective basis in
    international markets that are new to it. When the company
    acquires properties or platforms located in these markets, it
    may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or
    understanding of the local economy, forging new business
    relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local
    government and permitting procedures. The company works to
    mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and
    associations with experienced partners; however, there can be no
    guarantee that all such risks will be eliminated.

General
    Business Risks

The
    company faces risks associated with short-term liquid
    investments.

The company continues to have significant cash balances that it
    invests in a variety of short-term investments that are intended
    to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of
    liquidity while providing current income. From time to time,
    these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):

•

direct obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury;

•

obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or
    its agencies;

•

taxable municipal securities;

•

obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and
    thrifts;

•

commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term
    U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations
    and banks;

•

repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and
    asset-backed obligations;

•

both registered and unregistered money market funds; and

•

other highly rated short-term securities.

Investments in these securities and funds are not insured
    against loss of principal. Under certain circumstances the
    company may be required to redeem all or part of its investment,
    and its right to redeem some or all of its investment may be
    delayed or suspended. In addition, there is no guarantee that
    the company’s investments in these



securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. A decline
    in the value of the company’s investment or a delay or
    suspension of its right to redeem may have an adverse effect on
    the company’s results of operations or financial condition.

The
    company may experience losses that its insurance does not
    cover.

The company carries commercial liability, property and rental
    loss insurance covering all the properties that it owns and
    manages in types and amounts that it believes are adequate and
    appropriate given the relative risks applicable to the property,
    the cost of coverage and industry practice. Certain losses, such
    as those due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic
    activity, may be insured subject to certain limitations,
    including large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits.
    Although the company has obtained coverage for certain acts of
    terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits that
    the company considers commercially reasonable given the cost and
    availability of such coverage, the company cannot be certain
    that it will be able to renew coverage on comparable terms or
    collect under such policies. In addition, there are other types
    of losses, such as those from riots, bio-terrorism or acts of
    war, that are not generally insured in the company’s
    industry because it is not economically feasible to do so. The
    company may incur material losses in excess of insurance
    proceeds and it may not be able to continue to obtain insurance
    at commercially reasonable rates. Given current market
    conditions, there can also be no assurance that the insurance
    companies providing the company’s coverage will not fail or
    have difficulty meeting their coverage obligations to the
    company. Furthermore, the company cannot assure you that its
    insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products
    with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If
    the company experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds
    its insured limits with respect to one or more of its properties
    or if the company’s insurance companies fail to meet their
    coverage commitments to it in the event of an insured loss, then
    the company could lose the capital invested in the damaged
    properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those
    properties and, if there is recourse debt, then the company
    would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial
    obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general
    partner of the operating partnership, the parent company
    generally will be liable for all of the operating
    partnership’s unsatisfied recourse obligations, including
    any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the
    general partner of

co-investment

ventures. Any such losses or higher insurance costs could
    adversely affect the company’s financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to
    the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the
    operating partnership’s unitholders and the market price of
    the parent company’s stock.

A number of the company’s properties are located in areas
    that are known to be subject to earthquake activity.
    U.S. properties located in active seismic areas include
    properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and
    Seattle. The company’s largest concentration of such
    properties is in California where, on an owned and managed
    basis, as of December 31, 2010, the company had 277
    industrial buildings, aggregating approximately
    29.9 million square feet and representing 21.1% of its
    industrial operating properties based on aggregate square
    footage and 19.7% based on industrial annualized base rent, on
    an owned and managed basis. International properties located in
    active seismic areas include Tokyo and Osaka, Japan and Mexico
    City, Mexico. The company carries earthquake insurance on all of
    its properties located in areas historically subject to seismic
    activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that
    it believes are commercially reasonable. The company evaluates
    its earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current
    industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside
    consultants.

A number of the company’s properties are located in areas
    that are known to be subject to hurricane

and/or

flood
    risk. The company carries hurricane and flood hazard insurance
    on all of its properties located in areas historically subject
    to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and
    deductibles that it believes are commercially reasonable. The
    company evaluates its insurance coverage annually in light of
    current industry practice through an analysis prepared by
    outside consultants.

Contingent
    or unknown liabilities could adversely affect the company’s
    financial condition.

The company has acquired and may in the future acquire
    properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or
    with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities.
    As a result, if a liability were asserted against the company
    based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties,
    then the company might have to



pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect
    its cash flow. Contingent or unknown liabilities with respect to
    entities or properties acquired might include:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

losses in excess of the company’s insured coverage;

•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
    of business;

•

tax, legal and regulatory liabilities;

•

claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the
    company’s predecessors prior to its formation or
    acquisition transactions that had not been asserted or were
    unknown prior to the company’s formation or acquisition
    transactions; and

•

claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and
    directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the
    company’s properties.

Risks
    Associated with the Company’s Dependence on Key
    Personnel

The company depends on the efforts of its executive officers and
    other key employees. From time to time, the company’s
    personnel and their roles may change. As part of the
    company’s cost savings plan in 2008 and 2009, the company
    has reduced its total global headcount and may do so again in
    the future. In connection with the completion of the proposed
    merger with ProLogis, there may be additional changes to the
    company’s personnel and their roles that impact the
    combined company. While the company believes that it has
    retained its key talent, left its global platform intact and can
    find suitable employees to meet its personnel needs, the loss of
    key personnel, any change in their roles, or the limitation of
    their availability could adversely affect the company’s
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders, and the market price of the
    parent company’s stock. The company currently does not have
    employment agreements with any of its executive officers, other
    than agreements that may be contingent on the completion of the
    proposed merger with ProLogis.

Because the company’s compensation packages include
    equity-based incentives, pressure on the parent company’s
    stock price or limitations on the company’s ability to
    award such incentives could affect the company’s ability to
    offer competitive compensation packages to its executives and
    key employees. If the company is unable to continue to attract
    and retain its executive officers, or if compensation costs
    required to attract and retain key employees become more
    expensive, the company’s performance and competitive
    position could be materially adversely affected.

Federal
    Income Tax Risks

The
    parent company’s failure to qualify as a real estate
    investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to
    its stockholders.

The parent company elected to be taxed as a real estate
    investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal
    Revenue Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended
    December 31, 1997. The parent company believes it has
    operated so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust
    under the Internal Revenue Code and believes that the parent
    company’s current organization and method of operation
    comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the
    Internal Revenue Code to enable it to continue to qualify as a
    real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that the
    parent company has been organized or has operated in a manner
    that would not allow it to qualify as a real estate investment
    trust, or that the parent company’s future operations could
    cause it to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate
    investment trust requires the parent company to satisfy numerous
    requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis)
    established under highly technical and complex sections of the
    Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial
    and administrative interpretations, and involves the
    determination of various factual matters and circumstances not
    entirely within the parent company’s control. For example,
    in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the
    parent company must derive at least 95% of its gross income in
    any year from qualifying sources. In addition, the parent
    company must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating
    annually at least 90% of



its real estate investment trust taxable income (determined
    without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding
    capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a
    quarterly basis. While historically the parent company has
    satisfied the distribution requirement discussed above by making
    cash distributions to its stockholders, the parent company may
    choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of
    cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its
    own stock. For distributions with respect to taxable years
    ending on or before December 31, 2011, and in some cases
    declared as late as December 31, 2012, the parent company
    can satisfy up to 90% of this distribution requirement through
    the distribution of shares of its stock if certain conditions
    are met. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and
    applicable Treasury regulations regarding qualification as a
    real estate investment trust are more complicated in the parent
    company’s case because it holds its assets through the
    operating partnership.

If the parent company fails to qualify as a real estate
    investment trust in any taxable year, the parent company will be
    required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable
    alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular
    corporate rates. Unless the parent company is entitled to relief
    under certain statutory provisions, the parent company would be
    disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust
    for the four taxable years following the year in which the
    parent company lost its qualification. If the parent company
    lost its real estate investment trust status, the parent
    company’s net earnings available for investment or
    distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for
    each of the years involved. In addition, the parent company
    would no longer be required to make distributions to its
    stockholders.

Furthermore, the parent company owns a direct or indirect
    interest in certain subsidiary REITs which elected to be taxed
    as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal
    Revenue Code. Provided that each subsidiary REIT qualifies as a
    REIT, the parent company’s interest in such subsidiary REIT
    will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes
    of the REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains
    derived by the parent company from such subsidiary REIT will
    generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of
    the REIT gross income tests. To qualify as a REIT, the
    subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT
    qualification requirements. If such subsidiary REIT were to fail
    to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions did not
    apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and
    its income would be subject to United States federal income tax.
    In addition, a failure of the subsidiary REIT to qualify as a
    REIT would have an adverse effect on the parent company’s
    ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus
    the parent company’s ability to qualify as a REIT.

Certain
    property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income,
    resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the
    transaction.

From time to time, the company may transfer or otherwise dispose
    of some of its properties, including by contributing properties
    to its co-investment venture funds. Under the Internal Revenue
    Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties the
    company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in
    the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a
    prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. The
    company does not believe that its transfers or disposals of
    property or its contributions of properties into its
    co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. However,
    whether property is held for investment purposes is a question
    of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances
    surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue
    Service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of
    properties by the company or contributions of properties into
    the company’s co-investment venture funds are prohibited
    transactions. While the company believes that the Internal
    Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the
    Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a
    transfer, disposition, or contribution of property constituted a
    prohibited transaction, the company would be required to pay a
    100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to the company from the
    prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited
    transaction might adversely affect the company’s ability to
    satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate
    investment trust.

The
    parent company may in the future choose to pay dividends in its
    own stock, in which case you may be required to pay tax in
    excess of the cash you receive.

The parent company may distribute taxable dividends that are
    partially payable in cash and partially payable in its stock. Up
    to 90% of any such taxable dividend with respect to calendar
    years 2008 through 2011, and in some



cases declared as late as December 31, 2012, could be
    payable in the parent company’s stock if certain conditions
    are met. Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be
    required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary
    income to the extent of the parent company’s current and
    accumulated earnings and profits for United States federal
    income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be
    required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of
    the cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it
    receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales
    proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with
    respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of the
    parent company’s stock at the time of the sale.
    Furthermore, with respect to

non-U.S. stockholders,

the parent company may be required to withhold U.S. tax
    with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a
    portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition,
    if a significant number of the parent company’s
    stockholders determine to sell shares of its stock in order to
    pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the
    trading price of the parent company’s stock.

Legislative
    or regulatory action could adversely affect the parent
    company’s stockholders.

In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and
    administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax
    laws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities.
    Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur
    in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such
    changes will not adversely affect the taxation of the parent
    company, the operating partnership, any stockholder of the
    parent company or any limited partner of the operating
    partnership.

Conflicts
    of Interest Risks

Some
    of the company’s directors and executive officers are
    involved in other real estate activities and
    investments and, therefore, may have conflicts of interest
    with the company.

From time to time, certain of the company’s executive
    officers and directors may own interests in other real-estate
    related businesses and investments, including de minimis
    holdings of the equity securities of public and private real
    estate companies. The company’s executive officers’
    involvement in other real estate-related activities could divert
    their attention from the company’s

day-to-day

operations. The company’s executive officers have entered
    into non-competition agreements with the company pursuant to
    which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly
    or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to
    make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real
    estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the
    outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such
    activities or through certain specified investments. State law
    may limit the company’s ability to enforce these
    agreements. The company will not acquire any properties from its
    executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the
    transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and
    independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock
    Exchange) members of the parent company’s board of
    directors with respect to that transaction.

The
    parent company’s role as general partner of the operating
    partnership may conflict with the interests of its
    stockholders.

As the general partner of the operating partnership, the parent
    company has fiduciary obligations to the operating
    partnership’s limited partners, the discharge of which may
    conflict with the interests of the parent company’s
    stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited
    partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on
    certain amendments to the operating partnership’s
    partnership agreement and individually to approve certain
    amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited
    partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that
    conflicts with the interests of the parent company’s
    stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating
    partnership’s partnership agreement, holders of limited
    partnership units will have approval rights with respect to
    specified transactions that affect all stockholders but which
    they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of
    all stockholders.



Risks
    Associated with Government Regulations

The
    costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and
    any related potential liability could exceed the company’s
    budgets for these items.

Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a
    current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be
    liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of
    certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at,
    on, under, in or from its property. The costs of removal or
    remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws
    typically impose liability and

clean-up

responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator
    knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more
    than one person may have been responsible for the contamination,
    each person covered by the environmental laws may be held
    responsible for all of the

clean-up

costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or
    operator of a site for damages based on personal injury,
    property damage or other costs, including investigation and

clean-up

costs, resulting from the environmental contamination.

Environmental laws in some countries, including the United
    States, also require that owners or operators of buildings
    containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos,
    adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with
    asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or
    other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during
    building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines
    and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply
    with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek
    recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated
    with exposure to asbestos. Some of the company’s properties
    are known to contain asbestos-containing building materials.

In addition, some of the company’s properties are leased or
    have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses
    that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other
    hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the
    release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain
    of the company’s properties are on, adjacent to or near
    other properties that have contained or currently contain
    petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or
    upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in
    activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances.
    From time to time, the company may acquire properties, or
    interests in properties, with known adverse environmental
    conditions where the company believes that the environmental
    liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable
    and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted
    return. In such an instance, the company underwrites the costs
    of environmental investigation,

clean-up

and
    monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtains appropriate
    environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection
    with certain divested properties, the company has agreed to
    remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or
    monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.

At the time of acquisition, the company subjects all of its
    properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by
    independent environmental consultants and the company may have
    additional Phase II testing performed upon the
    consultant’s recommendation. These environmental
    assessments have not revealed, and the company is not aware of,
    any environmental liability that it believes would have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s financial
    condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
    Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal
    all environmental liabilities and that there are material
    environmental liabilities unknown to the company, or that known
    environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are
    greater than the company anticipated. Further, the
    company’s properties’ current environmental condition
    may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations
    in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from
    underground storage tanks) or by unrelated third parties. If the
    costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws
    and regulations exceed the company’s budgets for these
    items, then the company’s financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to the
    parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the
    operating partnership’s unitholders, and the market price
    of the parent company’s stock could be adversely affected.

Compliance
    or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act
    and other similar regulations could result in substantial
    costs.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public
    accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to
    access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result
    in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the
    award of damages to private litigants. If the company is
    required to make



unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with
    Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then the
    company’s cash flow and the amounts available for dividends
    to the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to
    the operating partnership’s unitholders may be adversely
    affected. The company’s properties are also subject to
    various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such
    as state and local fire and life-safety requirements. The
    company could incur fines or private damage awards if it fails
    to comply with these requirements. While the company believes
    that its properties are currently in material compliance with
    these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or
    new requirements may be imposed that could require significant
    unanticipated expenditures by the company that will affect its
    cash flow and results of operations.

Risks
    Associated with Ownership of the Parent Company’s
    Stock

Limitations
    in the parent company’s charter and bylaws could prevent a
    change in control.

Certain provisions of the parent company’s charter and
    bylaws may delay, defer or prevent a change in control or other
    transaction that could provide the holders of the parent
    company’s common stock with the opportunity to realize a
    premium over the then-prevailing market price for the common
    stock. To maintain the parent company’s qualification as a
    real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes,
    not more than 50% in value of the parent company’s
    outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by
    five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue
    Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a
    taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real
    estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, the
    parent company’s common stock must be held by a minimum of
    100 persons for at least 335 days of a

12-month

taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In
    addition, if the parent company, or an owner of 10% or more of
    the parent company’s stock, actually or constructively owns
    10% or more of one of the parent company’s customers (or a
    customer of any partnership in which the company is a partner),
    then the rent received by the parent company (either directly or
    through any such partnership) from that customer will not be
    qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment
    trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help
    the parent company maintain its qualification as a real estate
    investment trust for federal income tax purposes, the parent
    company prohibits the ownership, actually or by virtue of the
    constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
    by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of
    shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and
    outstanding shares of each of the parent company’s common
    stock, series L preferred stock, series M preferred
    stock, series O preferred stock, and series P
    preferred stock (unless such limitations are waived by the
    parent company’s board of directors). The parent company
    refers to this limitation as the “ownership limit.”
    The charter provides that shares acquired or held in violation
    of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the
    benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. The charter
    further provides that any person who acquires shares in
    violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any
    dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or
    receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in
    excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the
    amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation
    of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The
    ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
    preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely
    affect the parent company’s stockholders’ ability to
    realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the
    shares of the parent company’s common stock in connection
    with such transaction.

The parent company’s charter authorizes it to issue
    additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish
    the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class
    of preferred stock that the parent company issues. The parent
    company’s board of directors could establish a series or
    class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying,
    deferring or preventing a transaction, including a change in
    control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock
    or otherwise be in the best interests of the parent
    company’s stockholders.

The parent company’s charter and bylaws and Maryland law
    also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by
    stockholders without the approval of the parent company’s
    board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a
    transaction, including a change in control. The parent
    company’s charter and bylaws include the following
    provisions:

•

directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a
    two-thirds vote of stockholders;

•

the parent company’s board can fix the number of directors
    within set limits (which limits are subject to change by the
    parent company’s board), and fill vacant directorships upon
    the vote of a majority of the



remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the
    case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the
    board, a majority of the entire board;

•

stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or
    propose business for consideration at a stockholders’
    meeting; and

•

the request of the holders of 50% or more of the parent
    company’s common stock is necessary for stockholders to
    call a special meeting.

Maryland law includes the following provisions:

•

a two-thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend the
    parent company’s charter; and

•

stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous
    approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in
    question.

In addition, the parent company’s board could elect to
    adopt, without stockholder approval, other provisions under
    Maryland law that may impede a change in control.

If the
    parent company issues additional securities, then the investment
    of existing stockholders will be diluted.

As the parent company is a real estate investment trust, the
    company is dependent on external sources of capital and the
    parent company may issue common or preferred stock and the
    operating partnership may issue debt securities to fund the
    company’s future capital needs. The company has the
    authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or
    debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership or AMB
    Property II, L.P., one of the company’s subsidiaries, to
    issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or
    otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to
    acquire any additional securities issued by the operating
    partnership, AMB Property II, L.P., or the parent company and
    any issuance of additional equity securities may adversely
    affect the market price of the parent company’s stock and
    could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s
    investment. In addition, in the event the proposed merger with
    ProLogis is completed, the investment of existing stockholders
    will be diluted based on the exchange ratio of ProLogis shares
    of common stock into the company’s shares, which will
    result in current AMB stockholders owning approximately 40% of
    the combined company.

Earnings,
    cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the
    price of the parent company’s stock.

As the parent company is a real estate investment trust, the
    market value of the parent company’s equity securities, in
    general, is based primarily upon the market’s perception of
    the parent company’s growth potential and its current and
    potential future earnings and cash dividends. The market value
    of the parent company’s equity securities is based
    secondarily upon the market value of its underlying real estate
    assets. For this reason, shares of the parent company’s
    stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than its net
    asset value per share. To the extent that the parent company
    retains operating cash flow for investment purposes, working
    capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while
    increasing the value of the parent company’s underlying
    assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of its
    stock. The parent company’s failure to meet the
    market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and
    cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of
    the parent company’s stock. Further, the distribution yield
    on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock)
    relative to market interest rates may also influence the price
    of the parent company’s stock. An increase in market
    interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of the parent
    company’s stock to expect a higher distribution yield,
    which would adversely affect the parent company’s
    stock’s market price. Additionally, if the market price of
    the parent company’s stock declines significantly, then the
    operating partnership might breach certain covenants with
    respect to its debt obligations, which could adversely affect
    the company’s liquidity and ability to make future
    acquisitions and the parent company’s ability to pay cash
    dividends to its stockholders and the operating
    partnership’s ability to pay distributions to its
    unitholders.

The parent company’s board of directors has decided to
    align the parent company’s regular dividend payments with
    the projected taxable income from recurring operations alone.
    The parent company may make special



distributions going forward, as necessary, related to taxable
    income associated with any asset dispositions and gain activity.
    In the past, the parent company’s board of directors has
    suspended dividends to the parent company’s stockholders,
    and it is possible that they may do so again in the future, or
    decide to pay dividends partially in the parent company’s
    own stock as provided for in the Internal Revenue Code.

The
    parent company could change its investment and financing
    policies without a vote of stockholders.

Subject to the parent company’s current investment policy
    to maintain the parent company’s qualification as a real
    estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by the
    parent company’s board of directors under certain
    circumstances), the parent company’s board of directors
    determines the company’s investment and financing policies,
    its growth strategy and its debt, capitalization, distribution
    and operating policies. The parent company’s board of
    directors may revise or amend these strategies and policies at
    any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may
    not serve the interests of all of the parent company’s
    stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders and
    could adversely affect the company’s financial condition or
    results of operations, including its ability to pay cash
    dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders.

Shares
    available for future sale could adversely affect the market
    price of the parent company’s common stock.

The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had
    3,041,743 common limited partnership units issued and
    outstanding as of December 31, 2010, all of which are
    currently exchangeable on a

one-for-one

basis into shares of the parent company’s common stock. In
    the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P.
    may issue additional limited partnership units, and the parent
    company may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the
    acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares
    of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon
    exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public
    securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights
    that the parent company has granted, or may grant in connection
    with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144 under the
    Securities Act of 1933. In addition, common stock issued under
    the company’s stock option and incentive plans may also be
    sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that the
    parent company has filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of
    December 31, 2010, under the company’s stock option
    and incentive plans, the company had 4,014,453 shares of
    common stock reserved and available for future issuance, had
    outstanding options to purchase 8,694,938 shares of common
    stock (of which 6,361,551 are vested and exercisable and
    5,731,803 have exercise prices below market value at
    December 31, 2010) and had 1,202,122 unvested
    restricted shares of common stock outstanding. Future sales of a
    substantial number of shares of the parent company’s common
    stock in the market or the perception that such sales might
    occur could adversely affect the market price of the parent
    company’s common stock. Further, the existence of the
    common limited partnership units of the operating partnership
    and AMB Property II, L.P. and the shares of the parent
    company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange
    of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and
    registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the
    terms upon which the parent company is able to obtain additional
    capital through the sale of equity securities.

Risks
    Associated with the Company’s Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures and Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The
    company’s business could be adversely impacted if it has
    deficiencies in its disclosure controls and procedures or
    internal control over financial reporting.

The design and effectiveness of the company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures and internal control over financial
    reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or
    misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the
    effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there
    can be no guarantee that the company’s internal control
    over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all
    control objectives all of the time. Furthermore, the
    company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal
    control over financial reporting with respect to entities that
    the company does not control or manage or third-party entities
    that the company may acquire may be substantially more limited
    than those the company maintains with respect to the
    subsidiaries that the company has controlled or managed over the
    course of



time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting which
    may occur in the future could result in misstatements of the
    company’s results of operations, restatements of its
    financial statements, a decline in the parent company’s
    stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect the
    company’s business, reputation, results of operations,
    financial condition or liquidity.

Properties

INDUSTRIAL
    PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2010, the company owned and managed
    1,128 industrial buildings aggregating approximately
    141.9 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated
    basis, the company had 697 industrial buildings aggregating
    approximately 79.8 million rentable square feet), excluding
    development and renovation projects and recently completed
    development projects available for sale or contribution, located
    in 49 global markets throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia.
    The company’s industrial properties were 93.7% leased to
    2,655 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than
    3.1% of the company’s annualized base rent from its
    industrial properties. See Part IV, Item 15:
    Note 17 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for segment information related to the
    company’s operations.

Property Characteristics.

The company’s
    industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse
    distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple
    customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings.

The following table identifies types and characteristics of the
    company’s industrial buildings and each type’s
    percentage, based on square footage, of the company’s total
    owned and managed operating portfolio:

Lease Terms.

The company’s industrial
    properties are typically subject to leases on a “triple net
    basis,” in which customers pay their proportionate share of
    real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject
    to leases on a “modified gross basis,” in which
    customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In
    addition, most of the company’s leases include fixed rental
    increases or Consumer Price Index-based rental increases. Lease
    terms typically range from three to ten years, with a weighted
    average of six years, excluding renewal options. However, the
    majority of the company’s industrial leases do not include
    renewal options.

Rotterdam

Northern New Jersey/New York City

Within these metropolitan areas, the company’s industrial
    properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited
    new construction opportunities within established, relatively
    large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate
    of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere.
    These infill locations are typically near major airports or
    seaports or convenient to major highway systems and rail lines,
    and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is
    typically broad demand for industrial space in these
    centrally-located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries
    and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution,
    light assembly and manufacturing. The company generally avoids
    locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are
    fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial
    properties.

PROPERTIES
    HELD THROUGH CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES, LIMITED LIABILITY

COMPANIES AND PARTNERSHIPS

The company holds interests in both consolidated and
    unconsolidated joint ventures. The company consolidates joint
    ventures where it exhibits financial or operational control.
    Control is determined using accounting standards related to the
    consolidation of joint ventures and variable interest entities.
    For joint ventures that are defined as variable interest
    entities, the primary beneficiary consolidates the entity. In
    instances where the company is not the primary beneficiary, it
    does not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting
    purposes. For joint ventures that are not defined as variable
    interest entities, management first considers whether the
    company is the general partner or a limited partner (or the
    equivalent in such investments which are not structured as
    partnerships). The company consolidates joint ventures where it
    is the general partner (or the equivalent) and the limited
    partners (or the equivalent) in such investments do not have
    rights which would preclude control and, therefore,
    consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For joint
    ventures where the company is the general partner (or the
    equivalent), but does not control the joint venture as the other
    partners (or the equivalent) hold substantive participating
    rights, the company uses the equity method of accounting. For
    joint ventures where the company is a limited partner (or the
    equivalent), management considers factors such as ownership
    interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and
    contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners
    (or the equivalent) to determine if the presumption that the
    general partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances
    where these factors indicate the company controls the joint
    venture, the company consolidates the joint venture; otherwise
    it uses the equity method of accounting.

In addition, on August 2, 2010, the company announced the
    formation of AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, a publicly traded
    co-investment venture with a

10-year

term
    whose investment strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate
    and manage industrial distribution facilities primarily within
    the company’s target markets in Mexico. The functional
    currency of this co-investment venture is U.S. dollars and
    incentive distributions will be made upon dissolution of the
    venture. Initial contributions were made by the third party
    investors in the venture, comprised of institutional investors
    in Mexico, primarily private pension plans. These contributions
    are held by a third party trustee, which is not consolidated by
    the company, and, as such, the cash investment and equity
    interest of the third party investors are not reflected on the
    company’s consolidated financial statements. As of
    December 31, 2010, no investments had been made in real
    estate properties within this co-investment venture.

Consolidated
    Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2010, the company held interests in
    co-investment ventures, limited liability companies and
    partnerships with institutional investors and other third
    parties, which it consolidates in its financial statements.
    Under the agreements governing the co-investment ventures, the
    company and the other party to the co-investment venture may be
    required to make additional capital contributions and, subject
    to certain limitations, the co-investment ventures may incur
    additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain
    restrictions on the transfer of co-investment venture interests
    by the company or the other party to the co-investment venture
    and typically provide certain rights to the company or the other
    party to the co-investment venture to sell the company’s or
    their interest in the co-investment venture to the co-investment
    venture or to the other co-investment venture partner on terms
    specified in the agreement. In addition, under certain
    circumstances, many of the co-investment ventures include
    buy/sell provisions. See Part IV, Item 15:
    Notes 11 and 12 of the “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements” for additional details.

(1)

Represents activity within the company’s unconsolidated
    joint venture with Cyrela Commercial Properties, of which AMB
    Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P. holds a 50% equity
    interest.

(2)

Includes estimated total acquisition expenditures of
    approximately $3.6 million and $0.5 million,
    respectively, for properties acquired by AMB U.S. Logistics
    Fund, L.P. and AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS during the
    year ended December 31, 2010.



ITEM 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

As of December 31, 2010, there were no material pending
    legal proceedings to which the company was a party or of which
    any of the company’s properties was the subject, the
    adverse determination of which the company anticipated would
    have a material adverse effect upon the company’s financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Subsequent to year end, the parent company and the operating
    partnership have been named as defendants in at least two
    pending putative shareholder class actions filed in connection
    with the merger of the parent company and ProLogis:

James
    Kinsey, et al. v. ProLogis, et al.,

no. 2011CV818,
    filed on or about February 2, 2011 in the Denver County
    District Court, Colorado; and

Vernon C. Burrows, et al. v.
    ProLogis, et al.,

filed on or about February 15, 2011,
    in the Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore City. The
    complaint seeks to enjoin the merger, alleging, among other
    things, that ProLogis’ directors and certain executive
    officers breached their fiduciary duties by failing to maximize
    the value to be received by ProLogis shareholders and by
    improperly considering certain directors’ personal
    interests in the transaction in determining whether to enter
    into the merger agreement. The Maryland complaint also includes
    a derivative claim on behalf of ProLogis based upon the same
    allegations. Both complaints also assert a claim of aiding and
    abetting breaches of fiduciary duties against ProLogis, the
    parent company and the merger entitles. The Colorado complaint
    also asserts a claim of aiding and abetting breaches of
    fiduciary duties against the operating partnership. In addition
    to an order enjoining the transaction, the complaints seek,
    among other things, attorneys’ fees and expenses, and the
    Maryland complaint further seeks certain monetary damages. The
    parent company and the operating partnership view the complaints
    to be without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.

The payment of dividends and other distributions by the parent
    company is at the discretion of its board of directors and
    depends on numerous factors, including the parent company’s
    cash flow, financial condition and capital requirements, real
    estate investment trust provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
    and other factors.

    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities (AMB Property,
    L.P.)

There is no established public trading market for the operating
    partnership’s partnership units. As of December 31,
    2010, the operating partnership had outstanding 179,865,400
    partnership units, consisting of 177,806,670 general partnership
    units (consisting of 168,506,670 common units, 2,000,000 6.50%
    series L cumulative redeemable preferred units, 2,300,000
    6.75% series M cumulative redeemable preferred units,
    3,000,000 7.00% series O cumulative redeemable preferred
    units and 2,000,000 6.85% series P cumulative redeemable
    preferred units) and 2,058,730 common limited partnership units.
    The series L preferred units were issued on June 23,
    2003 to the parent company for total consideration of
    $50.0 million. The series M preferred units were
    issued on November 25, 2003 to the parent company for total
    consideration of $57.5 million. The series O preferred
    units were issued on December 13, 2005 to the parent
    company for total consideration of $75.0 million. The
    series P preferred units were issued on August 25,
    2006 to the parent company for total consideration of
    $50.0 million. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the
    common limited partnership units are redeemable by the holders
    thereof or, at the operating partnership’s option,
    exchangeable on a

one-for-one

basis for shares of the common stock of the parent company. As
    of December 31, 2010, there were 43 holders of record of
    our common limited partnership units (including the parent
    company’s general partnership interest).

During 2010, the operating partnership redeemed 61,198 common
    limited partnership units for the same number of shares of the
    parent company’s common stock. In addition, during 2010,
    the operating partnership



redeemed no common limited partnership units for cash. Set forth

ITEM 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Management’s
    Overview

The global economic recovery gained momentum in 2010, which made
    it possible for the company to successfully execute on its key
    growth initiatives for the year. In recognition of the improving
    capital markets and operating fundamentals around the world,
    management believes that the company has a leading position and
    competitive advantage in pursuing growth opportunities. As such,
    the company’s three priorities for 2011 are to:

•

increase the utilization of its assets;

•

scale the organization and become more profitable; and

•

form new co-investment ventures and funds.

Management believes the pace of the global economic recovery is
    strengthening and expects to see earnings growth if the company
    is able to improve asset utilization by returning its owned and
    managed portfolio closer to its historical occupancy average of
    95%; complete the

lease-up

of
    its development portfolio; and realize value from its land bank
    through new ventures, sales and future

build-to-suit

projects. Management believes the U.S. is in the early
    stages of the inventory rebuilding process and that the slower
    than normal rebuild does not signify a secular change in global
    supply chain practices, but rather inventories were drawn down
    to unsustainable levels due to stronger than anticipated holiday
    retail sales. The company believes that capital deployment
    opportunities are increasing and is currently evaluating
    multiple opportunities in its target markets around the globe.
    Management believes that its ability to provide multiple forms
    of consideration to institutional investors, lenders and private
    developers provide the company with proprietary access to
    acquisition opportunities. Additionally, management believes its
    existing and new private capital co-investment ventures and
    joint ventures are well positioned to benefit from the expected
    shift in customer demand for high-quality, well-located
    industrial real estate.

Strength
    of Balance Sheet and Liquidity

The company completed more than $1.9 billion of financings
    during the fourth quarter. This activity included
    $1.5 billion of wholly-owned debt consisting of the renewal
    of its two lines of credit, a corporate term loan, a new bond
    issuance, and $391 million for its co-investment ventures
    in Europe, Japan and the U.S. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the company completed financings of
    approximately $4.0 billion. These transactions further
    improved and extended the weighted average remaining life of the
    company’s share of debt to 4.8 years from
    3.8 years at an average interest rate of 4.6 percent.
    As of December 31, 2010 the company’s share of total
    debt to share of total assets was 43 percent, which
    includes its share of joint venture debt.

As of December 31, 2010 the company’s share of
    liquidity was approximately $1.6 billion, consisting of
    approximately $1.4 billion of availability on its lines of
    credit and more than $260 million of unrestricted cash and
    cash equivalents.

Real
    Estate Operations

Fundamentals in the U.S. industrial real estate market
    further improved in the fourth quarter. According to CBRE
    Econometric Advisors, the availability rate declined
    30 basis points to 14.3% and net absorption was positive
    33.2 million square feet. This is the largest improvement
    in net absorption in three years as well as more than four times
    the level reached in the third quarter. The recovery was more
    broad-based in the fourth quarter with approximately three
    quarters of the markets in the U.S. reflecting positive net
    absorption, which represents a 25 point increase from the
    third quarter. Availabilities in the coastal markets declined
    30 basis points to 12.0% after peaking at 12.5% in the
    first quarter 2010. The company continues to believe that
    record-low construction, when met by stronger demand, will drive
    the availability rate back down and that there will be a
    substantial improvement in net absorption in 2011.

Cash-basis same-store net operating income (“SS NOI”),
    without the effects of lease termination fees, increased
    0.9 percent during the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with
    the same period in 2009, driven by increases in occupancy. This
    increase in quarterly SS NOI marked the first positive

year-over-year

performance since the fourth quarter of 2008. SS NOI for the
    full year 2010 decreased 3.2 percent.



Rent changes on rollovers declined 11.9% on a trailing
    four-quarter basis and decreased 11.6% for the quarter. Rent
    changes on rollover were negative for 2010, although management
    believes net effective rents have bottomed in most of the
    company’s markets today.

Capital
    Deployment

The company commenced new development in the fourth quarter
    totaling approximately 695,800 square feet
    (64,640 square meters) and approximately 1.6 million
    square feet (150,150 square meters) during 2010 in Brazil,
    China and Mexico, with an estimated total investment of
    $102.9 million. During the quarter, acquisitions totaled
    $144.2 million, including $54.5 million for AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and $89.7 million for AMB
    Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS. The company also acquired a 50%
    interest in a joint venture mortgage debt investment for
    $86.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, the company
    held a total of 2,641 acres of land for future development
    or sale on an owned and managed basis, approximately 87% of
    which is located in the Americas. The company currently
    estimates that these 2,641 acres of land could support
    approximately 47.4 million square feet of future
    development.

Private
    Capital Business

During 2010, the company raised a record $781.4 million in
    third party private equity. As of December 31, 2010, the
    company had assets under management in nine significant
    co-investment ventures with a gross book value of approximately
    $8.2 billion.

On December 22, 2010, the company announced the formation
    of AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P., a
    co-investment venture with a third-party investor whose strategy
    is to develop, acquire, own, operate, manage and dispose of
    logistics properties primarily within the company’s target
    markets in Brazil, namely São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
    This venture will invest through an equity interest in the joint
    venture previously established between the company and its local
    Brazil partner, Cyrela Commercial Properties. The initial
    third-party equity investment will be approximately
    360.0 million Brazilian Reais (approximately
    $216.9 million in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate
    in effect at December 31, 2010) and the joint
    venture’s overall equity commitment is 720.0 million
    Brazilian Reais (approximately $433.8 million in
    U.S. dollars using the same exchange rate), including the
    company’s 50 percent co-investment.

On August 2, 2010, the company announced the formation of
    AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, a publicly traded co-investment
    venture with a

10-year

term
    whose investment strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate
    and manage industrial distribution facilities primarily within
    the company’s target markets in Mexico. Approximately
    3.3 billion Pesos was raised from the third party investors
    in the venture, comprised of institutional investors in Mexico,
    primarily private pension plans. These contributions, net of
    offering costs, held partially in Pesos and U.S. dollars,
    totaled approximately $252.2 million using the exchange
    rate in effect on December 31, 2010. The company will
    contribute 20% of the total equity, or approximately
    $63.1 million using the same exchange rate, at full
    deployment.

During 2010, in addition to the commitments of third-party
    equity in AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P. and
    AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, the company’s two open-ended

See Part I, Item 1, Notes 3 and 4 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    more detailed discussion of the company’s acquisition,
    development and disposition activity.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The company’s discussion and analysis of financial
    condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated
    financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements
    requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect
    the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as
    of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The
    company evaluates its assumptions and estimates on an on-going
    basis. The company bases its estimates on historical experience
    and



on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable
    under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following
    critical accounting policies affect its more significant
    judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its
    consolidated financial statements.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless
    circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which
    case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is
    made to reduce it to its estimated fair value. The company also
    regularly reviews the impact of above or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions,
    and records an intangible asset or liability accordingly.

The company conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate
    asset classes in accordance with its policy of accounting for
    the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which indicates
    that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property
    may not be fully recoverable. The intended use of an asset,
    either held for sale or held for the long term, can
    significantly impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is
    intended to be held for the long term, the impairment analysis
    is based on a two-step test. The first test measures estimated
    expected future cash flows over the holding period, including a
    residual value (undiscounted and without interest charges),
    against the carrying value of the property. If the asset fails
    the test, then the asset carrying value is measured against the
    estimated fair value from a market participant standpoint, with
    the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated
    fair value recognized as an impairment charge to earnings. If an
    asset is intended to be sold, impairment is tested based on a
    one-step test, comparing the carrying value to the estimated
    fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of expected future
    net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions
    regarding current and future economic and market conditions and
    the availability of capital. The company determines the
    estimated fair values based on assumptions regarding rental
    rates, costs to complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values.
    The company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams
    and the recent valuations of its two open-ended funds, which
    contain a large, geographically diversified pool of assets, all
    of which are subject to third-party appraisals on at least an
    annual basis.

Revenue Recognition.

The company records
    rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis
    over the term of the leases and maintains an allowance for
    estimated losses that may result from the inability of the
    company’s customers to make required payments. If customers
    fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than
    the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts, security
    deposits and letters of credit, then the company may have to
    recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods.
    The company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its
    customers on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial
    condition periodically as appropriate. Each period the company
    reviews its outstanding accounts receivable, including
    straight-line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide
    allowances as needed. The company also records lease termination
    fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination
    agreement with the company and the payment of the termination
    fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived
    before the fee is due to the company. If a customer remains in
    the leased space following the execution of a definitive
    termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are
    deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s
    occupancy.

Property Dispositions.

The company reports
    real estate dispositions in four separate categories on its
    consolidated statements of operations. First, when the company
    divests a portion of its interests in real estate entities or
    properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired
    by third-party investors for cash and are included in gains from
    sale or contribution of real estate interests in the statements
    of operations. Second, the company disposes of value-added
    conversion projects and

build-to-suit

and speculative development projects for which it has not
    generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or
    loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is
    reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and is
    included in development profits, net of taxes, within continuing
    operations of the statements of operations. Third, the company
    disposes of value-added conversion and other redevelopment
    projects for which it may have generated material operating
    income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized is reported
    net of estimated taxes, when applicable, in the development
    profits, net of taxes, line within discontinued operations.
    Lastly, guidance related to accounting for the impairment or
    disposal of long-lived assets requires the company to separately
    report as discontinued operations the historical



operating results attributable to industrial operating
    properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the
    disposition of the properties, which is included in development
    profits and gains from sale of real estate interests, net of
    taxes, in the statements of operations. The consolidated
    statements of operations for prior periods are also
    retrospectively adjusted to conform with guidance regarding
    accounting for discontinued operations and noncontrolling
    interests, and there is no impact on the company’s
    previously reported consolidated financial position, net income
    or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized
    using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to
    transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full
    accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when
    the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met.

Joint Ventures.

The company holds interests in
    both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. The company
    consolidates joint ventures where it exhibits financial or
    operational control. Control is determined using accounting
    standards related to the consolidation of joint ventures and
    variable interest entities. In June 2009, the FASB issued
    amended guidance related to the consolidation of
    variable-interest entities. These amendments require an
    enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the
    primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”) based on whether the entity (1) has the
    power to direct matters that most significantly impact the
    activities of the VIE, and (2) has the obligation to absorb
    losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could
    potentially be significant to the VIE. Additionally, they
    require an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary
    and provide a framework for the events that trigger a
    reassessment of whether an entity is a VIE. This guidance is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2009, and the company has
    adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. The company
    has evaluated the impact of the adoption of this guidance, and
    it did not have a material impact on the company’s
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

For joint ventures that are defined as variable interest
    entities, the primary beneficiary consolidates the entity. In
    instances where the company is not the primary beneficiary, it
    does not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting
    purposes. For joint ventures that are not defined as variable
    interest entities, management first considers whether the
    company is the general partner or a limited partner (or the
    equivalent in such investments which are not structured as
    partnerships). The company consolidates joint ventures where it
    is the general partner (or the equivalent) and the limited
    partners (or the equivalent) in such investments do not have
    rights which would preclude control and, therefore,
    consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For joint
    ventures where the company is the general partner (or the
    equivalent), but does not control the joint venture as the other
    partners (or the equivalent) hold substantive participating
    rights, the company uses the equity method of accounting. For
    joint ventures where the company is a limited partner (or the
    equivalent), management considers factors such as ownership
    interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and
    contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners
    (or the equivalent) to determine if the presumption that the
    general partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances
    where these factors indicate the company controls the joint
    venture, the company consolidates the joint venture; otherwise
    it uses the equity method of accounting.

Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are presented under
    the equity method. Under the equity method, these investments
    are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are
    subsequently adjusted to reflect the company’s
    proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint
    venture, distributions received, contributions, deferred gains
    from the contribution of properties and certain other
    adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there
    may have been a loss in value of an equity investment, the
    company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating
    the company’s ability to recover its investment or if the
    loss in value is other than temporary. To evaluate whether an
    impairment is other than temporary, the company considers
    relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the period of
    time in any unrealized loss position, the likelihood of a future
    recovery, and the company’s positive intent and ability to
    hold the investment until the forecasted recovery. If the
    company determines the loss in value is other than temporary,
    the company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the
    investment at fair value. Fair value is determined through
    various valuation techniques, including, but not limited to,
    discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third
    party appraisals.

Real Estate Investment Trust.

As a real estate
    investment trust, the parent company generally will not be
    subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the United
    States on the net income it distributes currently to its
    shareholders if it meets minimum distribution requirements, and
    certain income, asset and share ownership tests. However, some
    of the company’s subsidiaries may be subject to federal and
    state taxes. In addition, foreign entities



may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income
    tax allocation is required to be estimated on the company’s
    taxable income arising from its taxable real estate investment
    trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax
    component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus
    tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition.
    The company is required to establish a valuation allowance for
    deferred tax assets if it is determined, based on available
    evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. The company concluded, based on a
    review of the relative weight of the available evidence, that it
    was more likely than not that it would not generate sufficient
    future taxable income to realize certain deferred tax assets.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and
    Translation.

Transactions that require the
    remeasurement and translation of a foreign currency are recorded
    according to accounting guidance on foreign currency
    translation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for
    the company’s subsidiaries formed in the United States,
    Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. Other than Mexico and
    certain subsidiaries in Europe, the functional currency for the
    company’s subsidiaries operating outside the United States
    is generally the local currency of the country in which the
    entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of currency
    exchange gains and losses. The company’s subsidiaries whose
    functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their
    financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and
    liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of
    the financial statement date. The company translates income
    statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the
    period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate
    on the transaction date.

The company’s international subsidiaries may have
    transactions denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currencies. In these instances, non-monetary assets
    and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate,
    monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange
    rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement
    accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the
    period. The company also records gains or losses in the income
    statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in
    a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is
    settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more
    or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect
    when the transaction was initiated.

CONSOLIDATED
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store
    growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. The
    same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the
    end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and
    excludes development properties stabilized after
    December 31, 2008 (generally defined as properties that are
    90% occupied). As of December 31, 2010, the same store
    industrial pool consisted of properties aggregating
    approximately 68.5 million square feet. The company’s
    future financial condition and results of operations, including
    rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition and
    disposition of additional properties, and expenses may vary
    materially from historical results. Acquisition and development
    property divestiture activity for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows:

Same store rental revenues decreased $14.4 million from the
    prior year due primarily to decreased average occupancy and
    rental rates and increased free rent, as compared to the year
    ended December 31, 2009. The increase in rental revenues
    from development of $8.7 million is primarily due to
    increased occupancy of the company’s development portfolio
    as the company continues

lease-up

of
    the development pool, along with higher common-area maintenance
    and real estate tax reimbursement in 2010. Other industrial
    revenues include rental revenues from development projects that
    have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of
    the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in
    these revenues of $27.9 million primarily reflects the
    further

lease-up

of
    the company’s development portfolio and higher occupancy,
    along with higher common-area maintenance and real estate tax
    reimbursement in 2010, partially offset by increased free rent.
    The decrease in private capital revenues of $7.1 million
    was primarily due to a decrease in incentive and asset
    management fees recognized in 2010 as compared to fees
    recognized in the prior year for incentive distributions
    received from AMB DFS Fund I, LLC and asset management fees
    received from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., partially offset by
    an increase in acquisition fees recognized in 2010.

The decrease in same store operating expenses of
    $3.2 million from the prior year was primarily due to
    decreased average occupancy along with a decrease in repairs and
    maintenance expenses, roads and grounds expenses, administrative
    expenses and real estate taxes, partially offset by an increase
    in ground rent expense. The



increase in development operating costs of $6.6 million was
    primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes and other
    operating expenses due to continued

lease-up

and
    higher occupancy of the development portfolio. The increase in
    other industrial operating costs of $2.1 million was
    primarily due to an increase in utilities, repairs and
    maintenance expenses, roads and grounds expenses, administrative
    expenses and ground rent expenses during 2010. The increase in
    depreciation and amortization expenses of $21.3 million is
    primarily due to increased asset stabilizations and assets
    moving out of the held for sale or contribution pools in the
    early part of 2010. The increase in general and administrative
    expenses of $9.1 million is primarily due to an increase in
    professional service expenses, an increase in stock compensation
    amortization related to additional issuances of stock options
    and restricted stock in 2010 and a reduction in capitalized
    development costs, partially offset by decreases in tax expense,
    office expenses and insurance expenses. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the company recorded $4.9 million
    in restructuring charges associated with severance and the
    termination of certain contractual obligations, as compared to
    $6.4 million recorded in 2009, due to the further
    implementation of a previously initiated cost reduction plan,
    which included a reduction in global headcount, office closure
    costs and the termination of certain contractual obligations.
    The company did not record any real estate impairment losses in
    2010. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 2 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses
    recorded in the company’s results of operations during
    2009. Other expenses decreased $5.5 million primarily as a
    result of a change in the assets and liabilities associated with
    the company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan as
    well as a decrease in dead deal costs from prior year, partially
    offset by an increase of acquisition costs in 2010.

Development profits represent gains from the sale or
    contribution of development projects, including land. During the
    year ended December 31, 2010, the company recognized
    development profits of approximately $6.9 million primarily
    as a result of the sale of development projects to third
    parties, aggregating approximately 0.5 million square feet
    for an aggregate sales price of $36.4 million. This
    includes the installment sale of approximately 0.2 million
    square feet for $12.5 million with development profits of
    $3.9 million recognized in the three months ended
    March 31, 2010, which was initiated in the fourth quarter
    of 2009 and completed in the first quarter of 2010. During the
    year ended December 31, 2009, the company recognized
    development profits of approximately $6.1 million as a
    result of the sale of development projects, aggregating
    approximately 1.8 million square feet for an aggregate
    sales price of $149.9 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the company
    recognized development losses of approximately
    $0.2 million, as a result of the contribution of two
    completed development projects, aggregating approximately
    0.2 million square feet, to AMB Europe Logistics Fund,
    FCP-FIS in exchange for units in the fund. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the company recognized development
    profits of approximately $29.8 million, as a result of the
    contribution of three completed development projects,
    aggregating approximately 1.4 million square feet, to AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P.

During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    company did not contribute any industrial operating properties
    to unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint
    ventures of $6.1 million in 2010 was primarily due to
    impairment losses recognized on the company’s
    unconsolidated assets under management during 2009. Interest
    expense increased $11.4 million over the same period in
    2009 primarily due to an additional bond issuance in the fourth
    quarter of 2009, along with higher line utilization in 2010.
    Loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased by



$9.4 million primarily due to the completion of the
    repurchase of bonds in connection with the company’s tender
    offers in 2009.

Same store rental revenues decreased $63.4 million in 2009
    from the prior year due primarily to the contribution of AMB
    Partners II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment
    venture) to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P., an
    unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same
    store rental revenues for the year ended 2008 would have been
    $522.7 million if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P.
    had been contributed as of January 1, 2008, rather than
    July 1, 2008. The decrease of $25.3 million, excluding
    the effect of the contribution of interests in AMB Partners II,
    L.P., was primarily due to decreased occupancy during 2009. The
    increase in rental revenues from development of
    $10.8 million is primarily due to further

lease-up

of
    the development pool and increased occupancy at several of the
    company’s development projects. Other industrial revenues
    include rental revenues from development projects that have
    reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of the
    same store operating pool of properties. The increase in these
    revenues of $23.8 million primarily reflects further

lease-up

of
    the development pool and an increase in the number of projects
    that reached these levels of operation in 2009. The decrease in
    private capital revenues of $30.5 million was primarily due
    to a decrease in incentive and acquisition fees recognized in
    2009 from fees recognized in the prior year. In 2009, the
    company recognized incentive distributions from AMB DFS
    Fund I, LLC and asset management fees received from AMB
    Japan Fund I, L.P., and in 2008, the company received
    incentive distributions from AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P.
    and in connection with the sale of the partnership interests in
    AMB/Erie, L.P., including its final real estate asset to AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P.

Same store properties’ operating expenses decreased
    $6.0 million in 2009 from the prior year primarily due to
    the contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a
    consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB U.S. Logistics
    Fund, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on
    July 1, 2008. Same store operating expenses for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 would have been $147.6 million
    if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. had been contributed
    as of January 1, 2008. The increase of $3.6 million,
    excluding the effect of the contribution of interests in AMB
    Partners II, L.P., was primarily due to increased real estate
    taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance expenses and ground
    rent expenses. The increase in development operating costs of
    $8.2 million was primarily due to an increase in real
    estate taxes as well as increased utilities, repairs and
    maintenance expenses, insurance expenses, roads and grounds
    expenses and ground rent expenses due to higher occupancy in
    certain development projects. Other industrial expenses include
    expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which are not classified
    as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial
    statements, and development properties that have reached certain
    levels of operation but are not yet part of



the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in
    other industrial operating costs of $7.1 million was
    primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes as well as
    increased utilities, repairs and maintenance expenses, insurance
    expenses, roads and grounds expenses and administrative expenses
    due to an increase in the number of projects that have reached
    these levels of operation. The increase in depreciation and
    amortization expenses of $14.3 million was primarily due to
    $15.5 million additional depreciation expense recorded upon
    reclassification of assets from properties held for contribution
    to investments in real estate in 2009 and asset stabilizations,
    partially offset by the full depreciation expense taken on an
    asset demolition in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in
    general and administrative expenses of $28.6 million in
    2009 was primarily due to a personnel and cost reduction plan
    implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. During 2009, the
    company recorded $6.4 million in restructuring charges, as
    compared to $12.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of
    2008, due to the further implementation of the cost reduction
    plan, which included a reduction in global headcount, office
    closure costs and the termination of certain contractual
    obligations. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 2 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses
    recorded in the company’s results of operations during 2009
    and 2008. The increase in other expenses of $8.2 million
    was primarily due to changes in the assets and liabilities
    associated with the company’s non-qualified deferred
    compensation plan in 2009 as compared to the same period in the
    prior year, partially offset by a decrease in dead deal costs
    from amounts recognized in 2008.

Development profits represent gains from the sale or
    contribution of development projects, including land. During the
    year ended December 31, 2009, the company recognized
    development profits of approximately $6.1 million as a
    result of the sale of development projects, aggregating
    approximately 1.8 million square feet for an aggregate
    sales price of $149.9 million. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the company recognized development
    profits of approximately $7.2 million primarily as a result
    of the sale of development projects to third parties,
    aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet and land
    parcels, aggregating approximately 95 acres, for an
    aggregate sales price of $26.1 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company
    recognized development profits of approximately
    $29.8 million, as a result of the contribution of three
    completed development projects, aggregating approximately
    1.4 million square feet, to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund,
    L.P. and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the company recognized development
    profits of approximately $73.9 million, as a result of the
    contribution of 11 completed development projects, aggregating
    approximately 5.2 million square feet, to AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P., AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Europe
    Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company did
    not contribute any industrial operating properties to
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the company contributed one industrial
    operating property for approximately $66.2 million,
    aggregating approximately 0.8 million square feet, into AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. As a result, the company
    recognized a gain of $20.0 million on the contribution,
    representing the portion of the company’s interest in the
    contributed property acquired by the third-party investors for
    cash.

The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint
    ventures of $5.8 million for 2009 as compared to 2008, was
    primarily due to lower occupancy in 2009 and impairment losses
    recognized on the company’s unconsolidated assets under
    management, partially offset by the contribution of AMB Partners
    II, L.P. (previously,



a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB U.S. Logistics
    Fund, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on
    July 1, 2008. Other income (expense) increased
    $6.6 million in 2009 from the prior year primarily due to a
    change in the assets and liabilities associated with the
    company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan,
    partially offset by a decrease in bank interest income due to
    lower cash balances and interest rates in 2009 and an increase
    in foreign currency exchange rate losses. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the company recognized a loss on
    currency remeasurement of approximately $7.2 million,
    compared to a loss of approximately $5.7 million in the
    same period of 2008. Interest expense decreased
    $15.4 million primarily due to decreased borrowings as well
    as a decrease in interest rates in 2009. Loss on early
    extinguishment of debt increased by $11.5 million primarily
    due to early repayments of secured debt and the completion of
    the repurchase of bonds in connection with the company’s
    tender offers in 2009.

The decrease in income attributable to discontinued operations
    of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 was
    primarily due to higher real estate impairment losses recognized
    in 2009 on properties sold through December 31, 2010 or
    held for sale as of December 31, 2010. During the year
    ended December 31, 2009, the company sold value-added
    conversion development projects and land parcels aggregating
    approximately 0.2 million square feet and 21 land acres for
    a sale price of $143.9 million, with a resulting net gain
    of $53.0 million. No value-added conversion development
    projects were sold during 2008. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the company sold industrial operating
    properties aggregating approximately 2.3 million square
    feet for a sale price of $151.6 million, with a resulting
    gain of $37.2 million. Additionally, during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the company recognized a deferred gain
    of $1.6 million on the sale of industrial operating
    properties, aggregating approximately 0.1 million square
    feet, for a price of $17.5 million, which was deferred as
    part of the contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. to AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. in July 2008. During the year
    ended December 31, 2008, the company sold approximately
    0.1 million square feet of industrial operating properties
    for a sale price of $3.6 million, with a resulting gain of
    $1.0 million, and the company recognized a deferred gain of
    approximately $1.4 million on the sale of industrial
    operating properties, aggregating approximately 0.1 million
    square feet, for an aggregate price of $3.5 million, which
    was disposed of on December 31, 2007.

    Property II, L.P. in exchange for 2,880,281 shares of its
    common stock at a discount of $9.8 million and contributed
    the series D preferred units to the operating partnership.
    The operating partnership issued 2,880,281 general partnership
    units to the parent company in exchange for the 1,595,337
    series D preferred units the parent company purchased. No
    repurchases of units were made during the year ended

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE PARENT COMPANY

In this “Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Parent
    Company” section, the “parent company” refers
    only to AMB Property Corporation and not to any of its
    subsidiaries.

The parent company’s business is operated primarily through
    the operating partnership. The parent company issues public
    equity from time to time, but does not otherwise conduct any
    business or generate any capital itself. The parent company
    itself does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material
    asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating
    partnership. The parent company’s principal funding
    requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and
    preferred stock. The parent company’s principal source of
    funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives
    from the operating partnership.

As of December 31, 2010, the parent company owned an
    approximate 98.2% general partnership interest in the operating
    partnership, excluding preferred units. The remaining
    approximate 1.8% common limited partnership interests are owned
    by non-affiliated investors and certain current and former
    directors and officers of the parent company. As of
    December 31, 2010, the parent company owned all of the
    preferred limited partnership units of the operating
    partnership. As the sole general partner of the operating
    partnership, the parent company has the full, exclusive and
    complete responsibility for the operating partnership’s

day-to-day

management and control. The parent company causes the operating
    partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the parent
    company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash
    in the manner provided in the operating partnership’s
    partnership agreement. Generally, if distributions are made,
    distributions are paid in the following order of priority:
    first, to satisfy any prior distribution shortfall to the parent
    company as the holder of preferred units; second, to the parent
    company as the holder of preferred units; and third, to the
    holders of common units of the operating partnership, including
    the parent company, in accordance with the rights of each such
    class.

As general partner with control of the operating partnership,
    the parent company consolidates the operating partnership for
    financial reporting purposes, and the parent company does not
    have significant assets other than its investment in the
    operating partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of
    the parent company and the operating partnership are the same on
    their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held
    directly or indirectly at the operating partnership level, and
    the parent company has guaranteed some of the operating
    partnership’s secured and unsecured debt as discussed
    below. As the parent company consolidates the operating
    partnership, the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources of the Operating Partnership” should be read in
    conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and
    capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how
    the company is operated as a whole.

Capital
    Resources of the Parent Company

Distributions from the operating partnership are the parent
    company’s principal source of capital. The parent company
    receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but
    is required by the operating partnership’s partnership
    agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances
    to the operating partnership in exchange for partnership units
    of the operating partnership.

As circumstances warrant, the parent company may issue equity
    from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon
    market conditions and available pricing. The operating
    partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including
    borrowings under its lines of credit, to make acquisitions of
    properties, portfolios of properties or U.S. or foreign
    property-owning or real estate-related entities, to invest in
    existing or newly created joint ventures or for general
    corporate purposes.

Common and Preferred Equity

The parent company has
    authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred
    stock, of which the following series were designated as of
    December 31, 2010: 2,300,000 shares of series L
    cumulative redeemable preferred stock, of which 2,000,000 are
    outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative
    redeemable preferred stock, all of which are outstanding;
    3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable
    preferred stock, all of which are outstanding; and
    2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable
    preferred stock, all of which are outstanding.



In September 2010, the parent company’s board of directors
    approved a two-year common stock repurchase program for the
    repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the parent
    company’s common stock. The parent company has not
    repurchased any shares of its common stock under this program.

Noncontrolling interests in the parent company represent the
    common limited partnership interests in the operating
    partnership, limited partnership interests in AMB Property II,
    L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and interests held by
    third-party partners in joint ventures. Such joint ventures held
    approximately 20.9 million square feet as of
    December 31, 2010, and are consolidated for financial
    reporting purposes.

Please see “Explanatory Note” on page 1 and
    Part I, Item 1, Note 10 of the “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of the
    noncontrolling interests of the parent company.

In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the
    deployment of capital through market cycles, the parent company
    presently intends over the long term to operate with a parent
    company’s share of total

debt-to-parent

company’s share of total market capitalization ratio or
    parent company’s share of total

debt-to-parent

company’s share of total assets of approximately 45% or
    less. In order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long
    term, the parent company is currently exploring various options
    to monetize its development assets through possible contribution
    to funds where capacity is available, the formation of joint
    ventures and the sale to third parties. It is also exploring the
    potential sale of industrial operating assets to further enhance
    liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, the parent
    company’s share of total

debt-to-parent

company’s share of total assets ratio was 43.0%. (See
    footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for the
    definitions of “parent company’s share of total market
    capitalization,” “market equity,” “parent
    company’s share of total debt” and “parent
    company’s share of total assets.”) The parent company
    typically finances its co-investment ventures with secured debt
    at a

loan-to-value

ratio of

50-65%

pursuant to its co-investment venture agreements. Additionally,
    the operating partnership currently intends to manage its
    capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating
    on its senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies,
    however, the parent company’s and operating
    partnership’s



organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness
    that either entity may incur. Accordingly, management could
    alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder or
    unitholder approval or circumstances could arise that could
    render the parent company or the operating partnership unable to
    comply with these policies. For example, decreases in the market
    price of the parent company’s common stock have caused an
    increase in the ratio of parent company’s share of total

debt-to-parent

company’s share of total market capitalization.

Although the parent company does not hold any indebtedness
    itself, the parent company’s total debt reflects the
    consolidation of the operating partnership’s total debt for
    financial reporting purposes. The parent company’s
    definition of “total market capitalization” for the
    parent company is total debt plus preferred equity liquidation
    preferences plus market equity. The definition of “parent
    company’s share of total market capitalization” is the
    parent company’s share of total debt plus preferred equity
    liquidation preferences plus market equity. The definition of
    “market equity” is the total number of outstanding
    shares of common stock of the parent company and common limited
    partnership units of the operating partnership and AMB Property
    II, L.P. multiplied by the closing price per share of the parent
    company’s common stock as of December 31, 2010. The
    definition of “preferred” is preferred equity
    liquidation preferences. “Parent company’s share of
    total debt” is the parent company’s pro rata portion
    of the total debt based on the parent company’s percentage
    of equity interest in each of the consolidated and
    unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. “Parent
    company’s share of total assets” is the parent
    company’s pro rata portion of the gross book value of real
    estate interests plus cash and other assets. As of
    December 31, 2010, the parent company’s share of total
    assets was approximately $9.3 billion. The parent company
    believes that share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental
    measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze
    the parent company’s leverage and to compare the parent
    company’s leverage to that of other companies. In addition,
    it allows for a more meaningful comparison of the parent
    company’s debt to that of other companies that do not
    consolidate their joint ventures. Parent company’s share of
    total debt is not intended to reflect the parent company’s
    actual liability should there be a default under any or all of
    such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a
    reconciliation of parent company’s share of total debt to
    total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see
    the table of debt maturities and capitalization in the section
    below entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources of the
    Operating Partnership.”

Liquidity
    of the Parent Company

The liquidity of the parent company is dependent on the
    operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient
    distributions to the parent company. The primary cash
    requirement of the parent company is its payment of dividends to
    its stockholders. The parent company also guarantees some of the
    operating partnership’s secured and unsecured debt
    described in the “Debt guarantees” section below. If
    the operating partnership fails to fulfill its debt
    requirements, which trigger parent guarantee obligations, then
    the parent company will be required to fulfill its cash payment
    commitments under such guarantees.

The parent company believes the operating partnership’s
    sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from
    operations and borrowings available under its unsecured credit
    facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution
    payments to the parent company and, in turn, for the parent
    company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders.
    However, there can be no assurance that the operating
    partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be
    available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs,
    including its ability to make distribution payments to the
    parent company. The unavailability of capital could adversely
    affect the operating partnership’s ability to pay its
    distributions to the parent company, which will, in turn,
    adversely affect the parent company’s ability to pay cash
    dividends to its stockholders and the market price of the parent
    company’s stock.



Should the parent company face a situation in which the
    operating partnership does not have sufficient cash available
    through its operations to continue operating its business as
    usual (including making its distributions to the parent
    company), the operating partnership may need to find alternative
    ways to increase the operating partnership’s liquidity.
    Such alternatives, which would be done through the operating
    partnership, may include, without limitation, divesting itself
    of properties and decreasing the operating partnership’s
    cash distribution to the parent company. Other alternatives are
    for the parent company to pay some or all of its dividends in
    stock rather than cash or issuing its equity in public or
    private transactions whether or not at favorable pricing or on
    favorable terms.

If the operating partnership is unable to obtain new financing
    or refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay
    them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then its
    cash flow may be insufficient to pay its distributions to the
    parent company, which will have, as a result, insufficient funds
    to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders.
    Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at
    the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to
    make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest
    rates upon refinancing, then the operating partnership’s
    interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would
    increase. This increased interest expense of the operating
    partnership would adversely affect the parent company’s
    ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market
    price of its stock.

The operating partnership may, from time to time, seek to retire
    or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases

and/or

exchanges for the parent company’s equity securities in
    open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or
    otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on
    prevailing market conditions, the parent company’s
    liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other
    factors. The amounts involved may be material.

For the parent company to maintain its qualification as a real
    estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its
    stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its REIT
    taxable income. While historically the parent company has
    satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash
    distributions to its stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this
    requirement by making distributions of cash or other property,
    including, in limited circumstances, the parent company’s
    own stock. As a result of this distribution requirement, the
    operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund
    its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies
    whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts
    can. The parent company may need to continue to raise capital in
    the equity markets to fund the operating partnership’s
    working capital needs, acquisitions and developments.

As circumstances warrant, the parent company may issue equity
    securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis,
    dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The
    parent company would contribute any such proceeds to the
    operating partnership, which would then use the proceeds to
    repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, to
    make acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or
    U.S. or foreign property-owning or real estate-related
    entities or platforms, to invest in existing or newly created
    joint ventures or for general corporate purposes.

The parent company anticipates that the operating partnership
    will be required to use proceeds from debt and equity financings
    (including the issuance of equity by the parent company) and the
    divestiture of properties, in addition to cash from its
    operations, to make its distribution payments and repay its
    maturing debt as it comes due. However, the parent company and
    the operating partnership may not be able to issue such
    securities on favorable terms or at all. The parent
    company’s or the operating partnership’s inability to
    issue securities on favorable terms or at all would adversely
    affect the operating partnership’s financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flow and its ability to pay
    distributions to the parent company, which will, in turn,
    adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s
    stock and the parent company’s ability to pay cash
    dividends to its stockholders.



Cash flows generated by the operating partnership were
    sufficient to cover the operating partnership’s
    distributions for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008, including its distributions to the parent company,
    which were, in turn, paid to the parent company’s
    stockholders as dividends. Cash flows from the operating
    partnership’s real estate operations and private capital
    businesses, which are included in “Net cash provided by
    operating activities” in the parent company’s Cash
    Flows from Operating Activities and cash flows from the
    operating partnership’s real estate development and
    operations businesses which are included in “Net proceeds
    from divestiture of real estate and securities” in the
    parent company’s Cash Flows from Investing Activities in
    its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were sufficient to
    pay dividends on the parent company’s common stock and
    preferred stock, distributions on common and preferred limited
    partnership units of the operating partnership and AMB Property
    II, L.P. and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The parent
    company uses proceeds from the operating partnership included in
    Cash Flows from Investing Activities (specifically, the proceeds
    from sales and contributions of properties as part of its real
    estate development and operations businesses) to fund dividends
    and distributions not covered by Cash Flows from Operating
    Activities, if any.

The following table sets forth the summary of the parent
    company’s dividends and the operating partnership’s
    distributions paid or payable for the years ended

Debt guarantees.

The parent company is the
    guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations with
    respect to its unsecured senior debt securities. As of
    December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.7 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 5.6% and had an average term of 6.1 years. The
    indenture for the senior debt securities contains limitations on
    mergers or consolidations of the parent company.

The parent company guarantees the operating partnership’s
    obligations with respect to certain of its other debt
    obligations related to the following two facilities. In November
    2010, the operating partnership paid off the outstanding Euro
    tranche balance of its original $425.0 million
    multi-currency term loan, which has a maturity of October 2012.
    As of December 31, 2010, only the Japanese Yen tranche of
    the term loan had an outstanding balance, which was
    approximately $153.9 million in U.S. dollars using the exchange
    rate in effect on that date, and bore a weighted average
    interest rate of 3.4%. Additionally, in November 2010, the
    operating partnership entered into a 153.7 million Euro
    senior unsecured term loan, maturing in November 2015. Using the
    exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2010, the term loan
    had an outstanding balance of approximately $205.8 million
    in U.S. dollars, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 2.8%. These term loans contain limitations on the
    incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations
    of the parent company.

The parent company is a guarantor of the operating
    partnership’s obligations under its $600.0 million
    (includes Euro, Yen, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollar or
    U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving
    credit facility. In November 2010, the operating partnership
    refinanced its $550.0 million multi-currency facility,



which was set to mature in June 2011, increasing the facility by
    $50.0 million and extending the maturity to March 2014.
    This facility had no outstanding balance as of December 31,
    2010.

The parent company, along with the operating partnership,
    guarantees the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a
    subsidiary of the operating partnership, under its credit
    facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in
    which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an
    ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be
    a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. This
    credit facility has an initial borrowing limit of
    45.0 billion Yen, previously 55.0 billion prior to the
    operating partnership’s early renewal in December 2010,
    which, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31,
    2010, equaled approximately $554.5 million
    U.S. dollars. Additionally, upon renewal, the credit
    facility maturity was extended from June 2011 to March 2014. As
    of December 31, 2010, this facility had a balance of
    $139.5 million, using the exchange rate in effect at
    December 31, 2010, and bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 1.97%.

The parent company and the operating partnership guarantee the
    obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled
    by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating
    partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant
    to a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility.
    The operating partnership and certain of its wholly owned
    subsidiaries, each acting as a borrower, with the parent company
    and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into this
    credit facility, which has an option to extend the maturity date
    to July 2012. As of December 31, 2010, this facility,
    maturing in July 2011, had a balance of $129.4 million,
    using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010, and
    bore a weighted average interest rate of 1.31%.

The credit agreements related to the above facilities contain
    limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on
    mergers or consolidations of the parent company.

Potential Contingent and Unknown
    Liabilities.

Contingent and unknown liabilities
    may include claims for indemnification by officers and directors
    and tax, legal and regulatory liabilities.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

Balance Sheet Strategy.

In general, the
    operating partnership uses unsecured lines of credit, unsecured
    notes, common and preferred equity (issued by the parent
    company, the operating partnership and their subsidiaries, as
    applicable) to capitalize its wholly owned assets. Over time,
    the operating partnership plans to retire non-recourse, secured
    debt encumbering its wholly owned assets and replace that debt
    with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing the
    co-investment ventures, in general, the operating partnership
    uses non-recourse, secured debt to capitalize its co-investment
    ventures.

The operating partnership currently expects that its principal
    sources of working capital and funding for debt service,
    development, acquisitions, expansion and renovation of
    properties will include:

•

cash on hand and cash flow from operations;

•

borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities;

•

other forms of secured or unsecured financing;

•

assumption of debt related to acquired properties;

•

proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including
    issuances of limited partnership units by the operating
    partnership’s subsidiaries);

•

proceeds from debt securities offerings by the operating
    partnership;

•

proceeds from equity offerings by the parent company;

•

net proceeds from divestitures of properties;

•

private capital from co-investment partners;



•

net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed
    development projects to its co-investment ventures; and

•

net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value-added
    conversion projects and land to third parties.

The operating partnership currently expects that its principal
    funding requirements will include:

•

debt service;

•

distributions on outstanding common, preferred and general
    partnership units;

•

working capital;

•

acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties, interests
    in real-estate related entities or platforms;

•

investments in existing or newly formed joint ventures; and

•

development, expansion and renovation of properties.

Capital
    Resources of the Operating Partnership

The operating partnership believes its sources of working
    capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and
    borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are
    adequate for it to meet its current liquidity requirements.
    However, there can be no assurance that the operating
    partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be
    available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs. The
    unavailability of capital could adversely affect the operating
    partnership’s financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and the ability to pay cash distributions to its
    unitholders and make payments to its noteholders.

For the parent company to maintain its qualification as a real
    estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its
    stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable
    income. As a result of this distribution requirement, the
    operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund
    its on-going operations to the same extent that other
    corporations whose parent companies are not real estate
    investment trusts can. The operating partnership may need to
    continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to
    fund its working capital needs, acquisitions and developments.

Cash Flows.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, cash provided by operating activities
    was $252.8 million as compared to $243.1 million for
    the same period in 2009. This change is primarily due to changes
    in the operating partnership’s accounts receivable and
    other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities. Cash
    used in investing activities was $586.6 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to cash provided
    by investing activities of $84.1 million for the same
    period in 2009. This change is primarily due to a decrease in
    net proceeds from divestiture of real estate and securities and
    an increase in additions to interests in unconsolidated joint
    ventures, partially offset by a decrease in additions to land,
    buildings, development costs, building improvements and lease
    costs. Cash provided by financing activities was
    $329.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010,
    as compared to cash used in financing activities of
    $298.4 million for the same period in 2009. This change is
    due primarily to a decrease in net payments on unsecured credit
    facilities and an increase in net proceeds from issuance of
    senior debt, net of payments. This activity was partially offset
    by a decrease in the issuance of common units, an increase in
    distributions paid and an increase in net payments on other debt.

Partners’ Capital.

As of
    December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had
    outstanding 168,506,670 common general partnership units

;

2,058,730 common limited partnership units; 2,000,000 6.50%
    series L cumulative redeemable preferred units; 2,300,000
    6.75% series M cumulative redeemable preferred units;
    3,000,000 7.00% series O cumulative redeemable preferred
    units; and 2,000,000 6.85% series P cumulative redeemable
    preferred units.

Development Completions.

Development
    completions are generally defined as properties that are 90%
    occupied or pre-leased, or that have been substantially complete
    for at least 12 months. Development completions



on a consolidated basis, during the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows, excluding
    value-added acquisitions (dollars in thousands):

Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate Interests,
    Net.

During the years ended December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the operating partnership did not contribute any
    industrial operating properties to unconsolidated co-investment
    ventures. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    operating partnership contributed one industrial operating
    property for approximately $66.2 million, aggregating
    approximately 0.8 million square feet, to AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. As a result, the operating
    partnership recognized a gain of $20.0 million on the
    contribution, representing the portion of its interest in the
    contributed property acquired by third-party investors for cash.
    These gains are presented in gains from sale or contribution of
    real estate interests, net, in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

Properties Held for Sale or Contribution,
    Net.

As of December 31, 2010, the operating
    partnership held for sale ten properties with an aggregate net
    book value of $55.9 million. These properties either are
    not in the operating partnership’s core markets, do not
    meet its current investment objectives, or are included as part
    of its

development-for-sale

or value-added conversion programs. The sales of the properties
    are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other
    customary conditions. Properties held for sale are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of
    December 31, 2009, the operating partnership held for sale
    three properties with an aggregate net book value of
    $13.9 million.

As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership held for
    contribution to co-investment ventures eight properties with an
    aggregate net book value of $186.2 million, which, when
    contributed, will reduce its average ownership interest in these
    projects from approximately 90% to an expected range of less
    than 40%. As of December 31, 2009, the operating
    partnership held for contribution to co-investment ventures 11
    properties with an aggregate net book value of
    $200.5 million.

As of December 31, 2010, no properties were reclassified
    from held for sale or held for contribution to investments in
    real estate as a result of the change in management’s
    intent to hold these assets. In accordance with the operating
    partnership’s policies of accounting for the impairment or
    disposal of long-lived assets, during the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the operating partnership recognized
    $1.2 million of additional depreciation expense and related
    accumulated depreciation from the reclassification of assets
    from properties held for sale and contribution to investments in
    real estate. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    operating partnership recognized additional depreciation expense
    and related accumulated depreciation of $15.5 million as a
    result of similar reclassifications, as well as impairment
    charges of $55.8 million on real estate assets held for
    sale or contribution for which it was determined that the
    carrying value was greater than the estimated fair value.



Gains from Sale of Real Estate Interests, Net of
    Taxes.

During the year ended December 31,
    2010, the operating partnership sold approximately
    1.0 million square feet of industrial operating properties
    for an aggregate sales price of $58.1 million, with a
    resulting gain of $19.8 million. In addition, during the
    year ended December 31, 2010, the company recognized a
    deferred gain of $0.4 million on the divestiture of
    industrial operating properties, aggregating approximately
    0.7 million square feet, for an aggregate sales price of
    $36.4 million, which was deferred as part of the
    contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. to AMB U.S. Logistics
    Fund, L.P. in July 2008. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, the operating partnership sold approximately
    2.3 million square feet of industrial operating properties
    for an aggregate sales price of $151.6 million, with a
    resulting gain of $37.2 million. In addition, during the
    year ended December 31, 2009, the operating partnership
    recognized a deferred gain of $1.6 million on the
    divestiture of industrial operating properties, aggregating
    approximately 0.1 million square feet, for an aggregate
    sales price of $17.5 million, which was deferred as part of
    the contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. to AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. in July 2008. During the year
    ended December 31, 2008, the operating partnership sold
    approximately 0.1 million square feet of industrial
    operating properties for an aggregate sales price of
    $3.6 million, with a resulting gain of $1.0 million,
    and it recognized a deferred gain of approximately
    $1.4 million on the sale of industrial operating
    properties, aggregating approximately 0.1 million square
    feet, for an aggregate price of $3.5 million, which were
    disposed of on December 31, 2007. These gains are presented
    in gains from sale of real estate interests, net of taxes, as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

Co-investment Ventures.

The operating
    partnership enters into co-investment ventures with
    institutional investors, which are managed by the operating
    partnership’s private capital group and provide it with an
    additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions,
    development projects and renovation projects, as well as private
    capital income. The operating partnership holds interests in
    both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

Third-party equity interests in the consolidated co-investment
    ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the
    consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010,
    the operating partnership owned approximately 80.8 million
    square feet of its properties (50.7% of the total operating and
    development portfolio) through its consolidated and
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. The operating partnership
    may make additional investments through these co-investment
    ventures or new co-investment ventures in the future and
    presently plans to do so.

On December 22, 2010, the company announced the formation
    of AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P., a
    single-investor co-investment venture whose strategy is to
    develop, acquire, own, operate, manage and dispose of logistics
    properties primarily within the company’s target markets in
    Brazil, namely São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. This venture
    will invest through an equity interest in the joint venture
    previously established between the company and its local Brazil
    partner, Cyrela Commercial Properties. The initial third-party
    equity investment will be approximately 360.0 million
    Brazilian Reais (approximately $216.9 million in
    U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at
    December 31, 2010) and the joint venture’s
    overall equity commitment is 720.0 million Brazilian Reais
    (approximately $433.8 million in U.S. dollars using
    the same exchange rate), including the company’s
    50 percent co-investment.

On August 2, 2010, the company announced the formation of
    AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, a publicly traded co-investment
    venture with a

10-year

term
    whose investment strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate
    and manage industrial distribution facilities primarily within
    the company’s target markets in Mexico. Approximately
    3.3 billion Pesos was raised from the third party investors
    in the venture, comprised of institutional investors in Mexico,
    primarily private pension plans. These contributions, net of
    offering costs, held partially in Pesos and U.S. dollars,
    totaled approximately $252.2 million using the exchange
    rate in effect at December 31, 2010. The company will
    contribute 20% of the total equity, or approximately
    $63.1 million, at full deployment, for total equity of
    $315.3 million available for future investments. Estimated
    investment capacity in AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, including the
    total equity contributions of $315.3 million, is
    $600 million.

In addition to the equity investments shown above, the operating
    partnership, through its investment in AMB Property Mexico, held
    equity interests in various other unconsolidated ventures
    totaling approximately $13.3 million as of
    December 31, 2010. Additionally, in December 2010, the
    company entered into a mortgage debt investment joint venture
    with a third-party partner and held an equity interest of
    $86.2 million as of December 31, 2010.

Debt.

In order to maintain financial
    flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through
    market cycles, the operating partnership presently intends over
    the long term to operate with an operating partnership’s
    share of total

debt-to-operating

partnership’s share of total market capitalization ratio or
    operating partnership’s share of total

debt-to-operating

partnership’s share of total assets of approximately 45% or
    less. In order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long
    term, the operating partnership is currently exploring various
    options to monetize



its development assets through possible contribution to funds
    where capacity is available, the formation of joint ventures and
    the sale to third parties. The operating partnership is also
    exploring the potential sale of operating assets to further
    enhance liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, the operating
    partnership’s share of total

debt-to-operating

partnership’s share of total assets ratio was 43.0%. (See
    footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for the
    definitions of “operating partnership’s share of total
    market capitalization,” “market capital,”
    “operating partnership’s share of total debt” and
    “operating partnership’s share of total assets.”)
    The operating partnership typically finances its co-investment
    ventures with secured debt at a

loan-to-value

ratio of

50-65%

per
    its co-investment venture agreements. Additionally, the
    operating partnership currently intends to manage its
    capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating
    on its senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies,
    however, the operating partnership’s organizational
    documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that it may
    incur. Accordingly, management could alter or eliminate these
    policies without unitholder approval or circumstances could
    arise that could render it unable to comply with these policies.
    For example, decreases in the market price of the parent
    company’s common stock have caused an increase in the ratio
    of operating partnership’s share of total

debt-to-operating

partnership’s share of total market capitalization.

As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate principal amount of
    the operating partnership’s secured debt was
    $1.0 billion, excluding $0.1 million of unamortized
    net premiums. Of the $1.0 billion of secured debt, $731.2
    million, excluding unamortized discounts, is secured by
    properties in the operating partnership’s joint ventures.
    Such secured debt is generally non-recourse and, as of
    December 31, 2010, bore interest at rates varying from 1.0%
    to 8.3% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 4.3%) and had
    final maturity dates ranging from July 2011 to November 2022. As
    of December 31, 2010, $695.7 million of the secured
    debt obligations bore interest at fixed rates (with a weighted
    average interest rate of 5.1%), while the remaining
    $266.6 million bore interest at variable rates (with a
    weighted average interest rate of 2.3%). As of December 31,
    2010, $586.8 million of the secured debt before unamortized
    premiums was held by co-investment ventures, including the
    AMB-SGP, L.P. loan agreement discussed below.

On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P.,
    a Delaware limited partnership, which is a subsidiary of the
    operating partnership, entered into a loan agreement for a
    $305.0 million secured financing. On the same day, pursuant
    to the loan agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered
    four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which mature
    in March 2012. One note has a principal of $160.0 million
    and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%. The second note has
    an initial principal borrowing of $40.0 million with a
    variable interest rate of 81.0 basis points above the
    one-month LIBOR rate. The third note has an initial principal
    borrowing of $84.0 million and a fixed interest rate of
    5.90%. The fourth note has an initial principal borrowing of
    $21.0 million and bears interest at a variable rate of
    135.0 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate. The
    aggregate principal amount outstanding under this loan agreement
    as of December 31, 2010 was $289.1 million.

As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.7 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 5.6% and had an average term of 6.1 years. In
    August 2010 and November 2010, the operating partnership issued
    senior unsecured notes of $300.0 million at 4.50% due 2017
    and $175.0 million at 4.00% due 2018, respectively. The
    unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various
    covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants,
    including compliance with financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and
    limitations on mergers or consolidations.

As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had
    $414.0 million outstanding in other debt which bore a
    weighted average interest rate of 3.3% and had an average term
    of 3.3 years. Other debt includes a $70.0 million
    credit facility obtained on August 24, 2007 by AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P., a subsidiary of the
    operating partnership, which had a $54.3 million balance
    outstanding as of December 31, 2010. The remaining
    $359.7 million outstanding in other debt, using the
    exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2010, is related
    to the term loans discussed below.

In November 2010, the operating partnership paid off the
    outstanding Euro tranche balance of its original
    $425.0 million multi-currency term loan, which has a
    maturity of October 2012. As of December 31, 2010, only the
    Japanese Yen tranche of the term loan had an outstanding
    balance, which was approximately $153.9 million in U.S.
    dollars, using the exchange rate in effect on that date, and
    bore a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%. Additionally,



in November 2010, the operating partnership entered into a
    153.7 million Euro senior unsecured term loan, maturing in
    November 2015. Using the exchange rate in effect on
    December 31, 2010, the term loan had an outstanding balance
    of approximately $205.8 million in U.S. dollars, which
    bore a weighted average interest rate of 2.8%.

The parent company guarantees the operating partnership’s
    obligations with respect to certain of its unsecured debt. These
    unsecured credit facilities contain affirmative covenants,
    including compliance with financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and
    limitations on mergers or consolidations. The operating
    partnership was in compliance with its financial covenants under
    its unsecured credit facilities at December 31, 2010.

If the operating partnership is unable to refinance or extend
    principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds
    from other capital transactions, then its cash flow may be
    insufficient to pay cash distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders in all years and to repay debt
    upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or
    other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance
    of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in
    higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest
    expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.
    This increased interest expense would adversely affect its
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash distributions to its unitholders and make
    payments to its noteholders.

The operating partnership may from time to time seek to retire
    or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases

and/or

exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases,
    privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases
    or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market
    conditions, its liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions
    and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

A downgrade in the operating partnership’s credit ratings
    on its long term debt could adversely affect its business and
    financial condition. A decrease in the operating
    partnership’s credit ratings could cause a negative
    reaction in the public and private markets for the parent
    company’s and the operating partnership’s securities,
    increase difficulty in accessing optimally priced financing and
    damage public perception of the company’s business. Also,
    if the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall
    below current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under the
    operating partnership’s unsecured credit facilities and
    certain term loans will increase. In addition, if the long-term
    debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment
    grade, the operating partnership may be unable to request
    borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or
    Japanese Yen, as applicable. However, the lack of other currency
    borrowings does not affect the operating partnership’s
    ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term
    loans. Also, the operating partnership’s lenders will not
    be able to terminate its credit facilities or certain term loans
    in the event that its credit rating falls below investment grade
    status. None of the operating partnership’s credit
    facilities contain covenants regarding the parent company’s
    stock price or market capitalization, thus a decrease in the
    parent company’s stock price is not expected to impact the
    operating partnership’s ability to borrow under its
    existing lines of credit. While the operating partnership
    currently does not expect its long-term debt ratings to fall
    below investment grade, in the event that the ratings do fall
    below those levels, it may be unable to exercise its options to
    extend the term of its credit facilities and the loss of the
    operating partnership’s ability to borrow in foreign
    currencies could affect its ability to optimally hedge its
    borrowings against foreign currency exchange rate changes.

In addition, based on publicly available information regarding
    its lenders, the operating partnership currently does not expect
    to lose borrowing capacity under its existing lines of credit as
    a result of a dissolution, bankruptcy, consolidation, merger or
    other business combination among its lenders. The operating
    partnership’s access to funds under its credit facilities
    is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to
    such facilities to meet their funding commitments to the
    operating partnership. If the operating partnership does not
    have sufficient cash flows and income from its operations to
    meet its financial commitments and lenders are not able to meet
    their funding commitments to the operating partnership, the
    operating partnership’s business, results of operations,
    cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.

The operating partnership’s primary financial covenants
    with respect to its credit facilities generally relate to fixed
    charge or debt service coverage, liabilities to asset value,
    debt to asset value and unencumbered cash flow. As of
    December 31, 2010, the operating partnership was in
    compliance with its financial covenants under its credit



facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that if the
    financial markets and economic conditions worsen, the operating
    partnership will be able to continue to comply with its
    financial covenants.

Certain of the operating partnership’s third party
    indebtedness is held by its consolidated or unconsolidated joint
    ventures. In the event that a joint venture partner is unable to
    meet its obligations under the operating partnership’s
    joint venture agreements or the third party debt agreements, the
    operating partnership may elect to pay its joint venture
    partner’s portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the
    mortgaged property or permit the lender to foreclose on the
    mortgaged property to meet the joint venture’s debt
    obligations. In either case, the operating partnership would
    lose income and asset value on the property.

In addition, increases in the cost of credit and difficulty in
    accessing the capital and credit markets may adversely impact
    the occupancy of the operating partnership’s properties,
    the disposition of its properties, private capital raising and
    contribution of properties to its co-investment ventures. If it
    is unable to contribute completed development properties to its
    co-investment ventures or sell its completed development
    projects to third parties, the operating partnership will not be
    able to recognize gains from the contribution or sale of such
    properties and, as a result, the net income available to its
    common unitholders and its funds from operations will decrease.
    Additionally, business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns
    and other similar factors that affect the operating
    partnership’s customers may adversely impact the operating
    partnership’s business and financial condition such as
    occupancy levels of its properties. Furthermore, general
    uncertainty in the real estate markets has resulted in
    conditions where the pricing of certain real estate assets may
    be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to capitalization
    rates and valuations, among other things, which may add to the
    difficulty of buyers or the operating partnership’s
    co-investment ventures to obtain financing on favorable terms to
    acquire such properties or cause potential buyers to not
    complete acquisitions of such properties. The market uncertainty
    with respect to capitalization rates and real estate valuations
    also adversely impacts the operating partnership’s net
    asset value.

While the operating partnership believes that it has sufficient
    working capital and capacity under its credit facilities to
    continue its business operations as usual in the near term,
    turbulence in the global markets and economies and prolonged
    declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect
    its liquidity and financial condition, as well as the liquidity
    and financial condition of its customers. If these market
    conditions persist, recur or worsen in the long term, they may
    limit the operating partnership’s ability, and the ability
    of its customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities and
    access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. In the event
    that it does not have sufficient cash available to it through
    its operations to continue operating its business as usual, the
    operating partnership may need to find alternative ways to
    increase its liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without
    limitation, divesting the operating partnership of properties,
    whether or not they otherwise meet its strategic objectives in
    the long term, at less than optimal terms; issuing and selling
    the operating partnership’s debt and equity in public or
    private transactions under less than optimal conditions;
    entering into leases with the operating partnership’s
    customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms;
    entering into lease renewals with the operating
    partnership’s existing customers with a decrease in rental
    rates at turnover or on suboptimal terms; or paying a portion of
    the parent company’s dividends in stock rather than cash.
    There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways
    to increase its liquidity will be available to the operating
    partnership. Additionally, taking such measures to increase its
    liquidity may adversely affect the operating partnership’s
    business, results of operations and financial condition.

As circumstances warrant, the operating partnership may issue
    debt securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis,
    dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The
    operating partnership would use the proceeds to repay debt,
    including borrowings under its lines of credit, to make
    acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or
    U.S. or foreign property-owning or real estate-related
    entities or platforms, to invest in newly formed or existing
    joint ventures, or for general corporate purposes.

Credit Facilities.

The operating partnership
    has a $600.0 million (includes Euro, Yen, British pounds
    sterling, Canadian dollar or U.S. dollar denominated
    borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility. In November
    2010, the operating partnership refinanced its
    $550.0 million multi-currency facility, which was set to
    mature in June 2011, increasing the facility by
    $50.0 million and extending the maturity to March 2014. The
    parent company is a guarantor of the operating
    partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The
    facility can be increased to up to $800.0 million upon
    certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally
    LIBOR plus a margin, which was



185.0 basis points as of December 31, 2010, based on
    the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating, with an
    annual facility fee of 35.0 basis points. If the operating
    partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below investment
    grade, it will be unable to request money market loans and
    borrowings in Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The
    four-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component,
    under which up to $600.0 million can be drawn in Euros,
    Yen, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars or
    U.S. dollars. The operating partnership uses the credit
    facility principally for acquisitions, funding development
    activity and general working capital requirements. As of
    December 31, 2010, there was no outstanding balance on this
    credit facility, and the remaining amount available was
    $589.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of
    $10.4 million, using the exchange rate in effect on
    December 31, 2010.

AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating
    partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit
    facility with an initial borrowing limit of 45.0 billion
    Yen, previously 55.0 billion prior to the operating
    partnership’s early renewal in December 2010, which, using
    the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010, equaled
    approximately $554.5 million U.S. dollars and bore a
    weighted average interest rate of 1.97%. The parent company,
    along with the operating partnership, guarantees the obligations
    of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as
    the obligations of any other entity in which the operating
    partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest
    and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under
    and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to
    use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and
    development of properties and for other real estate purposes in
    Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the
    credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of
    the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real
    estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate
    assets. Additionally, upon renewal, the credit facility maturity
    was extended from June 2011 to March 2014. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally Yen LIBOR plus a margin, which was
    185.0 basis points as of December 31, 2010, based on
    the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term
    debt. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in
    quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the
    operating partnership’s long-term debt, and was
    35.0 basis points as of December 31, 2010. As of
    December 31, 2010, the outstanding balance on this credit
    facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31,
    2010, was $139.5 million, and the remaining amount
    available was $415.0 million.

The operating partnership and certain of its wholly owned
    subsidiaries, each acting as a borrower, with the parent company
    and the operating partnership as guarantors, have a
    $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The
    parent company, along with the operating partnership, guarantees
    the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities
    controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the
    operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under
    and pursuant to this credit facility. Generally, borrowers under
    the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion
    of the borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility
    includes a multi-currency component under which up to
    $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong
    dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds
    sterling and Euros. The line, which matures in July 2011,
    carries a one-year extension option, which the operating
    partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the
    operating partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment
    grade, among other things. The rate on the borrowings is
    generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was 60.0 basis points
    as of December 31, 2010, based on the credit rating of the
    operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt,
    with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the
    operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. If
    the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall
    below investment grade, it will be unable to request borrowings
    in any currency other than U.S. dollars. The borrowers
    intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the
    acquisition and development of properties and general working
    capital requirements. As of December 31, 2010, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange
    rates in effect at December 31, 2010, was approximately
    $129.4 million with a weighted average interest rate of
    1.31%, and the remaining amount available was
    $370.6 million.

The above credit facilities contain affirmative covenants,
    including compliance with financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants of the operating partnership, including limitations on
    the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or
    consolidations. The operating partnership was in compliance with
    its financial covenants under each of these credit agreements as
    of December 31, 2010.

    $70.1 million, and $22.3 million in Yen, Canadian
    dollar and Singapore dollar-based borrowings outstanding at

    using the foreign exchange rates in effect on December 31,
    2010.

Operating partnership’s share of total debt represents the
    operating partnership’s pro rata portion of the total debt
    based on the operating partnership’s percentage of equity
    interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated joint
    ventures holding the debt. The operating partnership believes
    that operating partnership’s share of total debt is a
    meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management
    and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its
    leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for
    a more meaningful comparison of the operating partnership’s
    debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their
    joint ventures. Operating partnership’s share of total debt
    is not intended to reflect the operating partnership’s
    actual liability should there be a default under any or all of
    such loans or a liquidation of the co-investment ventures. The
    above table reconciles operating partnership’s share of
    total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure.



As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had debt
    maturing in 2011 through 2014, assuming extension options are
    exercised, as follows (dollars in thousands):

The operating partnership’s definition of “total
    market capitalization” for the operating partnership is
    total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus
    market capital. The definition of “operating
    partnership’s share of total market capitalization” is
    the operating partnership’s share of total debt plus
    preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market capital.
    The operating partnership’s definition of “market
    capital” is the total number of outstanding common general
    partnership units of the operating partnership and common
    limited partnership units of AMB Property II, L.P. multiplied by
    the closing price per share of the parent company’s common
    stock as of December 31, 2010. The definition of
    “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation
    preferences. “Operating partnership’s share of total
    debt” is the operating partnership’s pro rata portion
    of the total debt based on its percentage of equity interest in
    each of the consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures
    holding the debt. “Operating partnership’s share of
    total assets” is the operating partnership’s pro rata
    portion of the gross book value of real estate interests plus
    cash and other assets. As of December 31, 2010, the
    operating partnership’s share of total assets was
    $9.3 billion. The operating partnership believes that
    operating partnership’s share of total debt is a meaningful
    supplemental measure, which enables both management and
    investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to
    that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more

Liquidity
    of the Operating Partnership

As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had
    $198.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and
    $30.0 million in restricted cash. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the operating partnership increased the
    availability under its lines of credit by approximately
    $224 million while increasing its share of outstanding debt
    by approximately $409 million. As of December 31,
    2010, the operating partnership had $1.4 billion available
    for future borrowings under its three multi-currency lines of
    credit, representing line utilization of 17%.

The operating partnership’s available cash and cash
    equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party
    financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in
    its operating accounts. The invested cash is invested in money
    market funds that invest solely in direct obligations of the
    government of the United States or in time deposits with certain
    financial institutions. To date, the operating partnership has
    experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or
    cash equivalents; however, the operating partnership can provide
    no assurances that access to its invested cash and cash
    equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the
    financial markets.

At any point in time, the operating partnership also has a
    significant amount of cash deposits in its operating accounts
    that are with third party financial institutions, which was, as
    of December 31, 2010, approximately $171.3 million on
    a consolidated basis. These balances exceed the Federal Deposit
    Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While the operating
    partnership monitors daily the cash balances in its operating
    accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate, these
    cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial
    institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in
    the financial markets. To date, the operating partnership has
    experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating
    accounts.

The following table sets forth the operating partnership’s

On November 10, 2009, the parent company purchased all
    1,595,337 outstanding series D preferred units of AMB
    Property II, L.P. in exchange for 2,880,281 shares of its
    common stock at a discount of $9.8 million. The operating
    partnership issued 2,880,281 general partnership units to the
    parent company in exchange for the 1,595,337 series D
    preferred units the parent company purchased.

The operating partnership anticipates that it will be required
    to use proceeds from debt and equity financings and the
    divestitures of properties, in addition to cash from its
    operations, to make its distribution payments and repay its
    maturing debt as it comes due. However, the operating
    partnership may not be able to obtain future financings on
    favorable terms or at all. The operating partnership’s
    inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at
    all would adversely affect its financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash distributions to
    its unitholders and make payments to its noteholders. The
    operating partnership is currently exploring various options to
    monetize its development assets including contribution to funds
    where investment capacity is available, the formation of joint
    ventures and the sale of assets to third parties. The operating
    partnership is also exploring the potential sale of operating
    assets to further enhance liquidity. There can be no assurance,
    however, that the operating partnership will choose to or be
    able to monetize any of its assets.

Cash flows generated by the operating partnership’s
    business were sufficient to cover its distributions for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, including its
    distributions to the parent company, which are, in turn, paid to
    the parent company’s stockholders as dividends and
    distributions. Cash flows from the operating partnership’s
    real estate operations and private capital businesses, which are
    included in “Net cash provided by



operating activities” in its Cash Flows from Operating
    Activities and cash flows from its real estate development and
    operations businesses which are included in “Net proceeds
    from divestiture of real estate and securities” in its Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities in its Consolidated Statements
    of Cash Flows, were sufficient to pay distributions on common
    and preferred limited partnership units of the operating
    partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. and distributions to
    noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008. The operating partnership uses proceeds
    from its businesses included in Cash Flows from Investing
    Activities (specifically, the proceeds from sales and
    contributions of properties as part of its real estate
    development and operations businesses) to fund distributions not
    covered by Cash Flows from Operating Activities.

The following table sets forth the summary of the operating
    partnership’s distributions paid or payable for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

Development Portfolio.

As of December 31,
    2010, the operating partnership had eight

construction-in-progress

development projects, on an owned and managed basis, which are
    expected to total approximately 2.2 million square feet and
    have an aggregate estimated investment of $169.8 million
    upon completion, net of $1.0 million of cumulative real
    estate impairment losses to date. Four of these projects
    totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet with an
    aggregate estimated investment of $124.2 million were held
    in an unconsolidated co-investment venture.

Construction-in-progress,

at December 31, 2010, included projects expected to be
    completed through the third quarter of 2012.

On an owned and managed basis, the operating partnership had an
    additional 25 development projects available for sale or
    contribution totaling approximately 6.8 million square
    feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of
    $700.0 million, net of $67.6 million of cumulative
    real estate impairment losses to date, and an aggregate net book
    value of $680.6 million.

As of December 31, 2010, on an owned and managed basis, the
    operating partnership and its development joint venture partners
    have funded an aggregate of $855.5 million, or 91%, of the
    total estimated investment before the impact of real estate
    investment losses and will need to fund an estimated additional
    $82.9 million, or 9%, in order to complete its development
    portfolio.

In addition to its committed development pipeline, the operating
    partnership held a total of 2,641 acres of land for future
    development or sale, on an owned and managed basis,
    approximately 87% of which was located in the Americas. This
    included 254 acres that were held in unconsolidated joint
    ventures. The operating partnership currently estimates that
    these 2,641 acres of land could support approximately
    47.4 million square feet of future development.

Lease Commitments.

The operating partnership
    has entered into operating ground leases on certain land
    parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities and office space with
    remaining lease terms from 1 to 79 years. These buildings
    and improvements subject to ground leases are amortized ratably
    over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or
    40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under
    non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of
    December 31, 2010 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Co-Investment Ventures.

The operating
    partnership enters into co-investment ventures with
    institutional investors, acting as the general partner or
    manager of such ventures. These co-investment ventures are
    managed by the operating partnership’s private capital
    group and provide the company with an additional source of
    capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and
    renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of
    December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had
    investments in co-investment ventures with a gross book value of
    approximately $1.1 billion, which are consolidated for
    financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures of $732.7 million and
    a gross book value of approximately $7.1 billion. In the
    year ended December 31, 2010, the operating partnership
    made a $200.0 million investment in AMB U.S. Logistics
    Fund, L.P. and a $100.0 million investment in AMB Europe
    Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS. Additionally, third party investors
    contributed $257.0 million to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund,
    L.P. and $55.3 million in AMB



Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS during the year ended
    December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the
    operating partnership may make additional capital contributions
    to current and planned co-investment ventures of up to
    $286.4 million pursuant to the terms of the co-investment
    venture agreements. From time to time, the operating partnership
    may raise additional equity commitments for AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P., an open-ended unconsolidated
    co-investment venture formed in 2004 with institutional
    investors, most of whom invest through a private real estate
    investment trust, and for AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS, an
    open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in 2007
    with institutional investors. This could increase the operating
    partnership’s obligation to make additional capital
    commitments to these ventures. Pursuant to the terms of the
    partnership agreement of AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P., and
    the management regulations of AMB Europe Logistics Fund,
    FCP-FIS, the operating partnership is obligated to contribute
    20% of the total equity commitments until such time when its
    total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million or
    150.0 million Euros, respectively, at which time, its
    obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments.
    The operating partnership expects to fund these contributions
    with cash from operations, borrowings under its credit
    facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from
    property divestitures, which could adversely affect its cash
    flow.

On December 22, 2010, the company announced the formation
    of AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P., a
    single-investor co-investment venture whose strategy is to
    develop, acquire, own, operate, manage and dispose of logistics
    properties primarily within the company’s target markets in
    Brazil, namely São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. This venture
    will invest through an equity interest in the joint venture
    previously established between the company and its local Brazil
    partner, Cyrela Commercial Properties. The initial third-party
    equity investment will be approximately 360.0 million
    Brazilian Reais (approximately $216.9 million in
    U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at
    December 31, 2010) and the joint venture’s
    overall equity commitment is 720.0 million Brazilian Reais
    (approximately $433.8 million in U.S. dollars using
    the same exchange rate), including the company’s
    50 percent co-investment.

In addition, on August 2, 2010, the company announced the
    formation of AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, a publicly traded
    co-investment venture with a

10-year

term
    whose investment strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate
    and manage industrial distribution facilities primarily within
    the company’s target markets in Mexico. Approximately
    3.3 billion Pesos was raised from the third party investors
    in the venture, comprised of institutional investors in Mexico,
    primarily private pension plans. These contributions, net of
    offering costs, held partially in Pesos and U.S. dollars,
    totaled approximately $252.2 million using the exchange
    rate in effect on December 31, 2010. The company will
    contribute 20% of the total equity, or approximately
    $63.1 million, at full deployment, for total equity of
    $315.3 million available for future investments. As of
    December 31, 2010, no investments had been made in real
    estate properties within this co-investment venture.

Captive Insurance Company.

In December 2001,
    the operating partnership formed a wholly owned captive
    insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata),
    which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses
    below the attachment point of the operating partnership’s
    third-party insurance policies. The captive insurance company is
    one element of the operating partnership’s overall risk
    management program. The company capitalized Arcata in accordance
    with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata establishes
    annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss
    experience of the operating partnership’s properties. Like
    premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid
    to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific
    lease terms. Through this structure, the operating partnership
    believes that it has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market.

Potential Contingent and Unknown
    Liabilities.

Contingent and unknown liabilities
    may include the following:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

losses in excess of insured coverage;

•

claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the
    company’s predecessors prior to the company’s
    formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted
    or were unknown prior to the operating partnership’s
    formation or acquisition transactions;



•

claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and
    directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the
    operating partnership’s properties;

•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
    of business; and

•

tax, legal and regulatory liabilities.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Standby Letters of Credit.

As of
    December 31, 2010, the company had provided approximately
    $12.9 million in letters of credit, of which
    $10.4 million were provided under the operating
    partnership’s $600.0 million unsecured credit
    facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under
    certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other
    commitments.

Guarantees and Contribution
    Obligations.

Excluding parent guarantees
    associated with debt or contribution obligations as discussed in
    Part I, Item 1, Notes 5, 6 and 12 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” as of
    December 31, 2010, the company had outstanding guarantees
    and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of
    $403.0 million as described below.

As of December 31, 2010, the company had outstanding bank
    guarantees in the amount of $0.3 million used to secure
    contingent obligations, primarily obligations under development
    and purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2010, the
    company also guaranteed $58.6 million and
    $83.5 million on outstanding loans on five of its
    consolidated joint ventures and three of its unconsolidated
    joint ventures, respectively.

Also, the company has entered into contribution agreements with
    certain of its unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These
    contribution agreements require the company to make additional
    capital contributions to the applicable co-investment venture
    fund upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of
    certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional
    capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than the company’s share of the co-investment
    venture’s debt obligation or the value of the
    company’s share of any property securing such debt. The
    company’s contribution obligations under these agreements
    will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the
    fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the
    debt and obtained by the lender upon default. The company’s
    potential obligations under these contribution agreements
    totaled $260.6 million as of December 31, 2010.

Performance and Surety Bonds.

As of
    December 31, 2010, the company had outstanding performance
    and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $3.8 million.
    These bonds were issued in connection with certain of the
    company’s development projects and were posted to guarantee
    certain property tax obligations and the construction of certain
    real property improvements and infrastructure. Performance and
    surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the
    property taxes due or the completion of the improvements and
    infrastructure.

Promote Interests and Other Contractual
    Obligations.

Upon the achievement of certain
    return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, the
    company may be obligated to make payments to certain of its
    joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of
    their contractual agreements with the company. From time to time
    in the normal course of its business, the company enters into
    various contracts with third parties that may obligate the
    company to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other
    obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.

SUPPLEMENTAL
    EARNINGS MEASURES

Funds
    From Operations, as adjusted (“FFO, as adjusted”) and
    Funds From Operations Per Share and Unit, as adjusted
    (“FFOPS, as adjusted”)

The company believes that net income, as defined by
    U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure.
    However, the company considers funds from operations, as
    adjusted (or FFO, as adjusted), FFO per share and unit, as
    adjusted (or FFOPS, as adjusted), Core FFO, as adjusted and Core
    FFO per share and unit, as adjusted (or Core FFOPS, as adjusted)
    to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance.
    The company defines FFOPS, as adjusted, as FFO, as adjusted, per
    fully diluted weighted average share of the parent
    company’s common stock and operating partnership units. The
    company calculates FFO, as adjusted, as net income (or loss)
    available to common stockholders, calculated in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real
    estate held for investment purposes and real estate-related
    depreciation, and adjustments to derive the company’s pro
    rata share of FFO, as adjusted of consolidated and
    unconsolidated joint ventures. The company defines Core FFOPS,
    as adjusted as Core FFO, as adjusted per fully diluted weighted
    share of the parent company’s common stock and operating
    partnership units. The company calculates Core FFO, as adjusted
    as FFO, as adjusted excluding



the company’s share of development profits. These
    calculations also include adjustments for items as described
    below.

Unless stated otherwise, the company includes the gains from
    development, including those from value-added conversion
    projects, before depreciation recapture, as a component of FFO,
    as adjusted. The company believes gains from development should
    be included in FFO, as adjusted, to more completely reflect the
    performance of one of its lines of business. The company
    believes that value-added conversion dispositions are in
    substance land sales and as such should be included in FFO, as
    adjusted, consistent with the real estate investment trust
    industry’s long standing practice to include gains on the
    sale of land in funds from operations. However, the
    company’s interpretation of FFO, as adjusted, or FFOPS, as
    adjusted, may not be consistent with the views of others in the
    real estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be
    a divergence from the National Association of Real Estate
    Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition, and may not
    be comparable to funds from operations or funds from operations
    per share and unit reported by other real estate investment
    trusts that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently
    than the company does. In connection with the formation of a
    joint venture, the company may warehouse assets that are
    acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly
    formed venture. Some of the properties held for contribution
    may, under certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated
    under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, the company
    intends to include in its calculation of FFO, as adjusted, gains
    or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated
    real estate to joint ventures. Although such a change, if
    instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT
    definition, the company believes such calculation of FFO, as
    adjusted, will better reflect the value created as a result of
    the contributions. To date, the company has not included gains
    or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated
    warehoused assets in FFO, as adjusted.

In addition, the company calculates FFO, as adjusted, to exclude
    impairment and restructuring charges, debt extinguishment losses
    and the Series D preferred unit redemption discount. The
    impairment charges were principally a result of increases in
    estimated capitalization rates and deterioration in market
    conditions that adversely impacted values. The restructuring
    charges reflected costs associated with the company’s
    reduction in global headcount and cost structure. Debt
    extinguishment losses generally included the costs of
    repurchasing debt securities. The company repurchased certain
    tranches of senior unsecured debt to manage its debt maturities
    in response to the current financing environment, resulting in
    greater debt extinguishment costs. The Series D preferred
    unit redemption discount reflects the gain associated with the
    discount to liquidation preference in the Series D
    preferred unit redemption price less costs incurred as a result
    of the redemption. In 2008, the company also recognized charges
    to write-off pursuit costs related to development projects it no
    longer planned to commence and to establish a reserve against
    tax assets associated with the reduction of its development
    activities. Although difficult to predict, these items may be
    recurring given the uncertainty of the current economic climate
    and its adverse effects on the real estate and financial
    markets. While not infrequent or unusual in nature, these items
    result from market fluctuations that can have inconsistent
    effects on the company’s results of operations. The
    economics underlying these items reflect market and financing
    conditions in the short-term but can obscure the company’s
    performance and the value of the company’s long-term
    investment decisions and strategies. Management believes FFO, as
    adjusted, is significant and useful to both it and its
    investors. FFO, as adjusted, more appropriately reflects the
    value and strength of the company’s business model and its
    potential performance isolated from the volatility of the
    current economic environment and unobscured by costs (or gains)
    resulting from the company’s management of its financing
    profile in response to the tightening of the capital markets.
    However, in addition to the limitations of FFO Measures, as
    adjusted, generally discussed below, FFO, as adjusted, does not
    present a comprehensive measure of the company’s financial
    condition and operating performance. This measure is a
    modification of the NAREIT definition of funds from operations
    and should not be used as an alternative to net income or cash
    as defined by U.S. GAAP.

The company believes that the FFO Measures, as adjusted, are
    meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance
    because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value
    of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as
    reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses.
    However, since real estate values have historically risen or
    fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors
    and analysts have considered presentation of operating results
    for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to
    be insufficient. Thus, the FFO Measures, as adjusted,



are supplemental measures of operating performance for real
    estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost
    depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net
    income available to common stockholders, as defined by
    U.S. GAAP. The company believes that the use of the FFO
    Measures, as adjusted, combined with the required U.S. GAAP
    presentations, has been beneficial in improving the
    understanding of operating results of real estate investment
    trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of
    operating results among such companies more meaningful. The
    company considers the FFO Measures, as adjusted, to be useful
    measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial
    performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to
    sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and
    real estate depreciation and amortization, the FFO Measures, as
    adjusted, can help the investing public compare the operating
    performance of a company’s real estate between periods or
    as compared to other companies. While funds from operations and
    funds from operations per share are relevant and widely used
    measures of operating performance of real estate investment
    trusts, the FFO Measures, as adjusted, do not represent cash
    flow from operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP
    and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures
    in evaluating the company’s liquidity or operating
    performance. The FFO Measures, as adjusted, also do not consider
    the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the
    company’s real estate assets nor are the FFO Measures, as
    adjusted, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the
    company’s future cash requirements. Management compensates
    for the limitations of the FFO Measures, as adjusted, by
    providing investors with financial statements prepared according
    to U.S. GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of the
    FFO Measures, as adjusted, and a reconciliation of the FFO
    Measures, as adjusted, to net income available to common
    stockholders, a U.S. GAAP measurement.



The following table reflects the calculation of FFO, as

Same
    Store Net Operating Income (“SS NOI”)

The company defines NOI as rental revenues, including
    reimbursements, less property operating expenses. NOI excludes
    depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses,
    restructuring charges, real estate impairment losses,
    development profits (losses), gains (losses) from sale or
    contribution of real estate interests, and interest expense. The
    company believes that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the
    most appropriate earnings measure. However, NOI is a useful
    supplemental measure calculated to help investors understand the
    company’s operating performance, excluding the effects of
    gains (losses), costs and expenses which are not related to the
    performance of the assets. NOI is widely used by the real estate
    industry as a useful supplemental measure, which helps investors
    compare the company’s operating performance with that of
    other companies. Real estate impairment losses have been
    excluded in deriving NOI because the company does not consider
    its impairment losses to be a property operating expense. The
    company believes that the exclusion of impairment losses from
    NOI is a common methodology used in the real estate industry.
    Real estate impairment losses relate to the changing values of
    the company’s assets but do not reflect the current
    operating performance of the assets with respect to their
    revenues or expenses. The company’s real estate impairment
    losses are non-cash charges which represent the write down in
    the value of assets when estimated fair value over the holding
    period is lower than current carrying value. The impairment
    charges were principally a result of increases in estimated
    capitalization rates and deterioration in market conditions that
    adversely impacted underlying real estate values. Therefore, the
    impairment charges are not related to the current performance of
    the company’s real estate operations and should be excluded
    from its calculation of NOI.

The company considers SS NOI to be a useful supplemental measure
    of its operating performance for properties that are considered
    part of the same store pool. The company defines Cash-basis SS
    NOI as NOI on a same store basis excluding straight line rents
    and amortization of lease intangibles. The same store pool
    includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the
    current and prior year reporting periods and excludes
    development properties for both the current and prior reporting
    periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes
    properties purchased and development stabilized after
    December 31, 2008. The company considers SS NOI to be an
    appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because
    it reflects the operating performance of the real estate
    portfolio excluding effects of non-cash adjustments and provides
    a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a

year-over-year

comparison. In addition, the company believes that SS NOI helps
    investors compare the operating performance of its real estate
    as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and
    widely used measure of operating performance of real estate
    investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from
    operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be
    considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating the
    company’s liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also
    does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest
    expenses, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and
    amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or
    trends in development and construction activities that could
    materially impact the company’s results from operations.
    Further, the company’s computation of SS NOI may not be
    comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may
    use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI.



The following table reconciles SS NOI, cash-basis SS NOI and
    cash-basis SS NOI, excluding lease termination fees from net
    loss for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market
    prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. The
    company’s future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon
    prevailing market rates. Accordingly, the company manages its
    market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating,
    investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows
    for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures,
    distributions to stockholders and unitholders, payments to
    noteholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of the
    company’s outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which
    minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. The
    company’s exposure to market risk includes interest rate
    fluctuations in connection with its credit facilities and other
    variable rate borrowings and its ability to incur more debt
    without stockholder and unitholder approval, thereby increasing
    its debt service obligations, which could adversely affect its
    cash flows.

The table below summarizes the maturities and interest rates
    associated with the company’s fixed and variable rate debt
    outstanding at book value and estimated fair value before
    unamortized net discounts of $12.6 million as of
    December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands):

If market rates of interest on the company’s variable rate
    debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or
    decrease in interest cost on the company’s variable rate
    debt would be $1.6 million (net of the swap) annually. As
    of December 31, 2010, the book value and the estimated fair
    value of the company’s total consolidated debt (both
    secured and unsecured) were $3.3 billion and
    $3.4 billion, respectively, based on the company’s
    estimate of current market interest rates. As of
    December 31, 2009, the book value and the estimated fair
    value of the company’s total consolidated debt (both
    secured and unsecured) both were $3.2 billion, based on our
    estimate of current market interest rates.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, variable rate debt
    comprised 22.3% and 38.8%, respectively, of all the
    company’s outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was
    $0.7 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

Financial Instruments.

The company records all
    derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability. For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, the
    offset to this entry is to accumulated other comprehensive
    income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity for
    the parent company, partners’ capital for the operating
    partnership or income for any ineffectiveness. For derivatives
    which do not qualify as cash flow hedges, the offset to the
    change in fair value on the derivative asset or liability is
    recorded directly in earnings as gains or losses through other
    income (expenses). For revenues or expenses denominated in
    non-functional currencies, the company may use derivative
    financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate
    risk. The company’s derivative financial instruments in
    effect at December 31, 2010 were 24 interest rate swaps and
    one interest rate cap hedging cash flows of variable rate
    borrowings based on U.S. LIBOR and four foreign exchange
    forward contracts hedging intercompany loans. The company does
    not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.

International Operations.

The company’s
    exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange
    rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for
    the company’s subsidiaries operating in the United States,
    Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. The functional
    currency for the company’s subsidiaries operating outside
    the United States, other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in
    Europe, is generally the local currency of the country in which
    the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of
    foreign exchange gains and losses. The company’s
    subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
    U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into
    U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the
    exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. The
    company translates income statement accounts using the average
    exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring
    transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The gains
    (losses) resulting from the translation are



included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate
    component of stockholders’ equity for the parent company or
    partners’ capital for the operating partnership and totaled
    $36.7 million and $(22.0) million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The company’s international subsidiaries may have
    transactions denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currency. In these instances, non-monetary assets and
    liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate,
    monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange
    rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement
    accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the
    period. The company also records gains or losses in the income
    statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in
    a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is
    settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more
    or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect
    when the transaction was initiated. For the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total unrealized and
    realized gains (losses) from remeasurement and translation
    included in the company’s results of operations were
    $1.4 million, $(7.2) million and $(5.7) million,
    respectively.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures and Changes to Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

The parent company maintains disclosure controls and procedures
    that are designed to ensure that information required to be
    disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act
    of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
    forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
    to its management, including its chief executive officer and
    chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
    evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the parent
    company’s management recognizes that any controls and
    procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
    control objectives, and its management is required to apply its
    judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
    controls and procedures. Also, the parent company has
    investments in certain unconsolidated entities, which are
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As the
    parent company does not control or manage these entities, its
    disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities
    may be substantially more limited than those it maintains with
    respect to its consolidated subsidiaries.

As required by

Rule 13a-15(b)

or

Rule 15d-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, management
    of the parent company carried out an evaluation, under the
    supervision and with participation of its chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the
    design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures
    that were in effect as of the end of the year covered by this
    report. Based on the foregoing, the parent company’s chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer each concluded
    that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective at
    the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2010.

During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, the parent company
    continued migrating certain of its financial processing systems
    to Yardi software. This Yardi software implementation is part of
    the parent company’s initiative to transform its technology
    platform in support of its global operating platform. The parent
    company plans to continue implementing such software throughout
    other parts of its business over the next several fiscal
    quarters. In connection with the Yardi software implementation
    and resulting business process changes, the parent company
    continues to enhance the design and documentation of its
    internal control processes to ensure suitable control over its
    financial reporting.



Except as described above, there have been no changes in the
    parent company’s internal control over financial reporting
    during its most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its
    internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The parent company’s management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting.

The parent company’s management has used the framework set
    forth in the report entitled “Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate
    the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
    reporting. Based on the parent company’s evaluation under
    the framework in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework,” the parent company’s management has
    concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2010. The effectiveness of the
    parent company’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010, has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Controls
    and Procedures (AMB Property, L.P.)

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures and Changes to Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

The operating partnership maintains disclosure controls and
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
    forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
    to its management, including the chief executive officer and
    chief financial officer of its general partner, as appropriate,
    to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
    designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
    the operating partnership’s management recognizes that any
    controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
    desired control objectives, and its management is required to
    apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
    of possible controls and procedures. Also, the operating
    partnership has investments in certain unconsolidated entities,
    which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
    As the operating partnership does not control or manage these
    entities, its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to
    such entities may be substantially more limited than those it
    maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries.

As required by

Rule 13a-15(b)

or

Rule 15d-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, management
    of the operating partnership carried out an evaluation, under
    the supervision and with participation of the chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer of its general partner, of
    the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
    controls and procedures that were in effect as of the end of the
    year covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, the chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer of the operating
    partnership’s general partner each concluded that its
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
    reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2010.

During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, the operating
    partnership continued migrating certain of its financial
    processing systems to Yardi software. This Yardi software
    implementation is part of the operating partnership’s
    initiative to transform its technology platform in support of
    its global operating platform. The operating partnership plans
    to continue implementing such software throughout other parts of
    its business over the next several fiscal quarters. In
    connection with the Yardi software implementation and resulting
    business process changes, the operating partnership continues to
    enhance the design and documentation of its internal control
    processes to ensure suitable control over its financial
    reporting.

Except as described above, there have been no changes in the
    operating partnership’s internal control over financial
    reporting during its most recent fiscal quarter that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, its internal control over financial reporting.



Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The operating partnership’s management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting.

The operating partnership’s management has used the
    framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” published by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal control over
    financial reporting. Based on the operating partnership’s
    evaluation under the framework in “Internal Control
    — Integrated Framework,” the operating
    partnership’s management has concluded that its internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2010. The effectiveness of the operating
    partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of AMB Property Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of AMB
    Property Corporation (the “Company”) listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of the Company and its
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
    statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
    Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounted
    for business combinations in 2009.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Partners of AMB Property, L.P.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of AMB
    Property, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of the Operating
    Partnership and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Operating Partnership
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Operating
    Partnership’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Item 9A. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Operating Partnership’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
    audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
    material misstatement and whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Operating Partnership changed the manner in
    which it accounted for business combinations in 2009.

Organization
    and Formation of the Parent Company and the Operating
    Partnership

The Parent Company commenced operations as a fully integrated
    real estate company effective with the completion of its initial
    public offering on November 26, 1997. The Parent Company
    elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust
    (“REIT”) under Sections 856 through 860 of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
    “Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended
    December 31, 1997, and believes its current organization
    and method of operation will enable it to maintain its status as
    a REIT. The Parent Company, through its controlling interest in
    its subsidiary, the Operating Partnership, is engaged in the
    ownership, acquisition, development and operation of industrial
    properties in key distribution markets throughout the Americas,
    Europe and Asia. Unless otherwise indicated, the notes to
    consolidated financial statements apply to both the Parent
    Company and the Operating Partnership.

The Company uses the terms “industrial properties” or
    “industrial buildings” to describe the various types
    of industrial properties in its portfolio and uses these terms
    interchangeably with the following: logistics facilities,
    centers or warehouses; distribution facilities, centers or
    warehouses; High Throughput
    Distribution

®

(HTD

®

)

    facilities; or any combination of these terms. The Company uses
    the term “owned and managed” to describe assets in
    which it has at least a 10% ownership interest, for which it is
    the property or asset manager and which it currently intends to
    hold long term. The Company uses the term “joint
    venture” to describe all joint ventures, including

co-investment

ventures, with real estate developers, other real estate
    operators, or institutional investors where the Company may or
    may not have control, act as the manager

and/or

developer, earn asset management distributions or fees, or earn
    incentive distributions or promote interests. In certain cases,
    the Company might provide development, leasing, property
    management

and/or

accounting services, for which it may receive compensation. The
    Company uses the term “co-investment venture” to
    describe joint ventures with institutional investors, managed by
    the Company, from which the Company typically receives
    acquisition fees for acquisitions, portfolio and asset
    management distributions or fees, as well as incentive
    distributions or promote interests.

As of December 31, 2010, the Parent Company owned an
    approximate 98.2% general partnership interest in the Operating
    Partnership, excluding preferred units. The remaining
    approximate 1.8% common limited partnership interests are owned
    by non-affiliated investors and certain current and former
    directors and officers of the Parent Company. As the sole
    general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company
    has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion
    in the

day-to-day

management and control of the Operating Partnership. Net
    operating results of the Operating Partnership are allocated
    after preferred unit distributions based on the respective
    partners’ ownership interests. Certain properties are owned
    by the Company through limited partnerships, limited liability
    companies and other entities. The ownership of such properties
    through such entities does not materially affect the
    Company’s overall ownership interests in the properties.

Any references to the number of buildings, square footage,
    customers and occupancy in the financial statement footnotes are
    unaudited.

Through the Operating Partnership, the Company enters into
    co-investment ventures with institutional investors. These
    co-investment ventures provide the Company with an additional
    source of capital and income. As of December 31, 2010, the
    Company had significant investments in nine co-investment
    ventures, including the co-investment venture established in
    Brazil in December 2010, as discussed below.

On December 22, 2010, the Company announced the formation
    of AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P., a
    co-investment venture with a third-party partner whose strategy
    is to develop, acquire, own, operate, manage and dispose of
    logistics properties primarily within the Company’s target
    markets in Brazil, namely São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
    This venture will invest through an equity interest in the joint
    venture previously established between the Company and its local
    Brazil partner, Cyrela Commercial Properties. The initial
    third-party equity investment will be approximately
    360.0 million Brazilian Reais (approximately
    $216.9 million in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate
    in effect at December 31, 2010) and the joint
    venture’s overall equity commitment is 720.0 million
    Brazilian Reais (approximately $433.8 million in
    U.S. dollars using the same exchange rate), including the
    Company’s 50 percent co-investment.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition, on August 2, 2010, the Company announced the
    formation of AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, a publicly traded
    co-investment venture with a

10-year

term
    whose investment strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate
    and manage industrial distribution facilities primarily within
    the Company’s target markets in Mexico. Approximately
    3.3 billion Pesos was raised from the third party investors
    in the venture, comprised of institutional investors in Mexico,
    primarily private pension plans. These contributions, net of
    offering costs, held partially in Pesos and U.S. dollars,
    totaled approximately $252.2 million using the exchange
    rate in effect on December 31, 2010. These contributions
    are held by a third party trustee, which is not consolidated by
    the Company, and, as such, the cash investment and equity
    interest of the third party investors are not reflected on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company
    will contribute 20% of the total equity, or approximately
    $63.1 million, at full deployment, for total equity of
    $315.3 million available for future investments. As of
    December 31, 2010, no investments had been made in real
    estate properties within this co-investment venture.

In December 2010, the Company entered into a mortgage debt
    investment joint venture with a third-party partner, and made an
    investment of $86.0 million for an equity interest of
    50 percent.

Effective January 1, 2010, the name of the Company’s
    unconsolidated co-investment venture AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. was changed to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund,
    L.P. Effective October 29, 2010, the name of the
    Company’s unconsolidated co-investment venture AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS was changed to AMB Europe Logistics Fund,
    FCP-FIS.

AMB Capital Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
    (“AMB Capital Partners”), provides real estate
    investment services to clients on a fee basis. Headlands Realty
    Corporation, a Maryland corporation, conducts a variety of
    businesses that includes development projects available for sale
    or contribution to third parties and incremental income
    programs. IMD Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
    conducts a variety of businesses that also includes development
    projects available for sale or contribution to third parties.
    AMB Capital Partners, Headlands Realty Corporation and IMD
    Holding Corporation are direct subsidiaries of the Operating
    Partnership.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company owned or had
    investments in, on a consolidated basis or through
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures, properties and
    development projects expected to total approximately
    159.6 million square feet (14.8 million square meters)
    in 49 markets within 15 countries.

Of the approximately 159.6 million square feet as of
    December 31, 2010:

•

on an owned and managed basis, which includes investments held
    on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint
    ventures, the Company owned or partially owned approximately
    141.9 million square feet (principally, warehouse
    distribution buildings) that were 93.7% leased; the Company had
    investments in eight development projects, which are expected to
    total approximately 2.2 million square feet upon
    completion; the Company owned 25 projects, totaling
    approximately 6.8 million square feet, which are available
    for sale or contribution; and the Company had three value-added
    acquisitions, totaling approximately 1.2 million square
    feet;

•

through non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, the Company
    had investments in 46 industrial operating buildings, totaling
    approximately 7.3 million square feet; and

•

the Company held approximately 152,000 square feet through
    a ground lease, which is the location of the Company’s
    global headquarters.

Value-added acquisitions represent unstabilized properties
    acquired by the Company, which generally have one or more of the
    following characteristics: (i) existing vacancy, typically
    in excess of 20%, (ii) short-term lease rollover, typically
    during the first two years of ownership, or
    (iii) significant capital improvement requirements,
    typically in excess of 20% of the purchase price. The Company
    excludes value-added acquisitions from its owned and managed and
    consolidated operating statistics prior to stabilization
    (generally 90% leased).

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements included herein have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows of the Company, its wholly owned
    qualified REIT and taxable REIT subsidiaries, the Operating
    Partnership and co-investment ventures, in which the Company has
    a controlling interest. Third-party equity interests in the
    Operating Partnership and co-investment ventures are reflected
    as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial
    statements. The Company also has non-controlling partnership
    interests in unconsolidated real estate co-investment ventures,
    which are accounted for under the equity method. All significant
    intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications.

Certain items in the
    consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been
    reclassified to conform to current classifications.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless
    circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which
    case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is
    made to reduce it to its estimated fair value. The Company also
    reviews the impact of above or below-market leases, in-place
    leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions, and records
    an intangible asset or liability accordingly.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local airport
    authorities, and subject to ground leases are depreciated over
    the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the
    underlying ground lease. The estimated lives and components of
    depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows (dollars in
    thousands):

related to business combinations and capitalizes land
    acquisition costs. Project costs directly associated with the
    development and construction of a real estate project, which
    include interest and property taxes, are capitalized as
    construction in progress. Capitalized interest related to
    construction projects for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008 was $35.2 million, $41.3 million
    and $64.4 million, respectively.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Maintenance expenditures include
    painting and repair costs. The Company expenses costs as
    incurred and does not accrue in advance of planned major
    maintenance activities. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic useful life of assets are capitalized
    and include parking lot, HVAC and roof replacement costs.

Real Estate Impairment Losses and Restructuring
    Charges.

The Company conducts a comprehensive
    review of all real estate asset classes in accordance with its
    policy of accounting for the impairment or disposal of
    long-lived assets, which indicates that asset values should be
    analyzed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying value of a property may not be fully
    recoverable. The intended use of an asset, either held for sale
    or held for the long term, can significantly impact how
    impairment is measured. If an asset is intended to be held for
    the long term, the impairment analysis is based on a two-step
    test. The first test measures estimated expected future cash
    flows over the holding period, including a residual value
    (undiscounted and without interest charges), against the
    carrying value of the property. If the asset fails the test,
    then the asset carrying value is measured against the estimated
    fair value from a market participant standpoint, with the excess
    of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated fair value
    recognized as an impairment charge to earnings. If an asset is
    intended to be sold, impairment is tested based on a one-step
    test, comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value
    less costs to sell. The estimation of expected future net cash
    flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions
    regarding current and future economic and market conditions and
    the availability of capital. The Company determines the
    estimated fair values based on assumptions regarding rental
    rates, costs to complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values.
    The Company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams
    and the recent valuations of its two open-ended funds, which
    contain a large, geographically diversified pool of assets, all
    of which are subject to third-party appraisals on at least an
    annual basis. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the
    Company did not recognize any real estate impairment losses.
    Impairments may be necessary in the future in the event that
    market conditions deteriorate and impact the factors used to
    estimate fair value.

As a result of changing market conditions, a portion of the
    Company’s real estate assets were written down to estimated
    fair value and a non-cash impairment charge was recognized in
    the first quarter of 2009 and fourth quarter of 2008. The
    principal trigger which led to the impairment charges was
    continued economic deterioration in some markets resulting in a
    decrease in the assumptions of leasing and rental rates and
    rising vacancies. In addition, the pricing of transactions in
    some of the Company’s markets, as well as in-process sales
    agreements on some of its assets targeted for disposition were
    indicative of an increase in capitalization rates. The real
    estate impairment losses recognized on these assets represent
    the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair
    value, which, on a consolidated basis, totaled
    $181.9 million and $193.9 million during the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, on certain
    of its investments. These real estate impairment losses did not
    impact the Company’s liquidity, cost and availability of
    credit or affect the Operating Partnership’s continued
    compliance with its various financial covenants under its credit
    facilities and unsecured bonds.

The Company recognized restructuring charges of approximately
    $4.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2010
    associated with severance and the termination of certain
    contractual obligations, all of which were cash related
    expenses. The Company recognized restructuring charges of
    approximately $6.4 million and $12.3 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, associated with
    severance, office closures, and terminations of certain
    contractual obligations. During 2009 and 2008, $3.9 million
    and all of the restructuring charges were cash-related expenses,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
    accrued liabilities of $2.5 million for restructuring
    charges, which were paid in 2010.

Investments in Consolidated and Unconsolidated Joint
    Ventures.

The Company holds interests in both
    consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company
    consolidates joint ventures where it exhibits

F-14


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

financial or operational control. Control is determined using
    accounting standards related to the consolidation of joint
    ventures and variable interest entities. In June 2009, the FASB
    issued amended guidance related to the consolidation of
    variable-interest entities. These amendments require an
    enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the
    primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”) based on whether the entity (1) has the
    power to direct matters that most significantly impact the
    activities of the VIE, and (2) has the obligation to absorb
    losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could
    potentially be significant to the VIE. Additionally, they
    require an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary
    and provide a framework for the events that trigger a
    reassessment of whether an entity is a VIE. This guidance is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2009, and the Company has
    adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. The Company
    has evaluated the impact of the adoption of this guidance, and
    it did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

For joint ventures that are defined as variable interest
    entities, the primary beneficiary consolidates the entity. In
    instances where the Company is not the primary beneficiary, it
    does not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting
    purposes. For joint ventures that are not defined as variable
    interest entities, management first considers whether the
    Company is the general partner or a limited partner (or the
    equivalent in such investments which are not structured as
    partnerships). The Company consolidates joint ventures where it
    is the general partner (or the equivalent) and the limited
    partners (or the equivalent) in such investments do not have
    rights which would preclude control and, therefore,
    consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For joint
    ventures where the Company is the general partner (or the
    equivalent), but does not control the joint venture as the other
    partners (or the equivalent) hold substantive participating
    rights, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. For
    joint ventures where the Company is a limited partner (or the
    equivalent), management considers factors such as ownership
    interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and
    contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners
    (or the equivalent) to determine if the presumption that the
    general partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances
    where these factors indicate the Company controls the joint
    venture, the Company consolidates the joint venture; otherwise
    it uses the equity method of accounting.

Under the equity method, investments in unconsolidated joint
    ventures are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost
    and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the Company’s
    proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint
    venture, distributions received, contributions, deferred gains
    from the contribution of properties and certain other
    adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there
    may have been a loss in value of an equity investment, the
    Company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating
    the Company’s ability to recover its investment or if the
    loss in value is other than temporary. To evaluate whether an
    impairment is other than temporary, the Company considers
    relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the period of
    time and extent in any unrealized loss position, the likelihood
    of a future recovery, and the Company’s positive intent and
    ability to hold the investment until the forecasted recovery. If
    the Company determines the loss in value is other than
    temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to
    reflect the investment at fair value. Fair value is determined
    through various valuation techniques, including, but not limited
    to, discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third
    party appraisals. No impairment charge was recognized for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted policies related to
    accounting for noncontrolling interests in consolidated
    financial statements, which clarified that a noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the
    consolidated entity that should be reported as equity or capital
    in the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
    adoption of these policies, the Company has retrospectively
    renamed the minority interests as noncontrolling interests and
    has reclassified these balances to the equity or capital
    sections of the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, on the
    consolidated statements of operations, the presentation of net
    income (loss) retrospectively includes the portion of income
    attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less. These balances exceed the

F-15


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While
    the Company monitors daily the cash balances in its operating
    accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate, these
    cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial
    institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in
    the financial markets. To date, the Company has experienced no
    loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with property purchases,
    Section 1031 exchange accounts and debt or real estate tax
    payments.

Accounts Receivable.

Accounts receivable
    includes all current accounts receivable, net of allowances,
    other accruals and deferred rent receivable of
    $81.7 million and $68.4 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company
    regularly reviews the credit worthiness of its customers and
    adjusts its allowance for doubtful accounts, straight-line rent
    receivable balance and tenant improvement and leasing costs
    amortization accordingly.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

Other real
    estate companies compete with the Company in its real estate
    markets. This results in competition for customers to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Company’s ability to lease space and
    on the amount of rent received. As of December 31, 2010,
    the Company does not have any material concentration of credit
    risk due to the diversification of its customers.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the straight-line method, which
    approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the
    related loan. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, deferred
    financing costs were $38.1 million and $24.9 million,
    respectively, net of accumulated amortization.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

The Company
    has classified as goodwill the cost in excess of fair value of
    the net assets of companies acquired in purchase transactions.
    In accordance with the Company’s policy of accounting for
    goodwill and other intangible assets, goodwill and certain
    indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but
    are subject to at least annual impairment testing. The Company
    tests annually (or more often, if necessary) for impairment
    under this policy. The Company determined that there was no
    impairment to goodwill and intangible assets pursuant to this
    testing during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
    As of December 31, 2010, the Company had goodwill of
    $42.3 million.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

Effective
    April 1, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued guidance which the Company has adopted regarding
    the evaluation of the fair value of financial instruments for
    interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial
    statements. Due to their short-term nature, the estimated fair
    value for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts
    receivable, dividends and distributions payable, and accounts
    payable and other liabilities approximate their book value. The
    estimated fair value of Deferred Financing Costs approximates
    its book value. Refer to Note 21 entitled “Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities” for the related fair value
    disclosures.

In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance, updated in October
    2009 for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2009,
    related to accounting for fair value measurements which defines
    fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value
    in order to meet disclosure requirements for fair value
    measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that
    would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability
    (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for
    the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants on the measurement date. This guidance also
    establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to
    maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. This hierarchy
    describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure
    fair value.

Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the
    consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs
    to the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
    liabilities include debt and equity securities for which
    instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for

F-16


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

transactions in active exchange markets involving identical
    assets. In addition, Level 1 asset and liabilities related
    to the Company’s deferred compensation plan are valued
    based upon transactions in active exchange markets involving
    assets identical to the underlying investments contained within
    the plan.

Level 2.

Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities
    include derivative contracts whose value is determined using a
    pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or
    can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable
    market data where applicable, such as equity prices, interest
    rate yield curves, option volatility, currency rates and
    counterparty credit risk.

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation using
    unobservable inputs. For the real estate assets included in
    Level 3, the Company used the market participant pricing
    approach, which estimates what a potential buyer would pay
    today. The key inputs used in the model included capitalization
    and rental growth rate assumptions, estimated costs to complete
    and expected lease up and holding periods. When available,
    current market information, like comparative sales price, was
    used to determine capitalization and rental growth rates. When
    market information was not readily available, the inputs were
    based on the Company’s understanding of market conditions
    and the experience of the management team.

Represents certain real estate assets held for sale, held for
    contribution or reclassified between held for dispositions and
    held for use categories on a consolidated basis that are marked
    to their fair values at December 31, 2010 and 2009, as a
    result of real estate impairment losses, net of recoveries.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities.

Based on
    the Company’s policy of accounting for derivative
    instruments and hedging activities, the Company records all
    derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The majority of
    the Company’s derivatives are either designated or qualify
    as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future
    cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, and are
    considered cash flow hedges. For revenues or expenses
    denominated in nonfunctional currencies, the Company may use
    derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency
    exchange rate risk. The Company assesses the effectiveness of
    each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value
    or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the
    changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged
    item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges,
    changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Hedge
    accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of
    gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the
    recognition of the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted
    transactions in a cash flow hedge.

The Company’s derivative financial instruments in effect at
    December 31, 2010 consisted of 24 interest rate swaps
    hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on Euribor
    (EUR) JPY Tibor and JPY Libor, one interest rate cap hedging
    cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on USD Libor, and
    four currency forward contracts hedging intercompany loans.
    Adjustments to the fair value of 23 interest rate swaps and the
    interest rate cap are included in other assets and other
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and accumulated
    other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of
    equity or capital. Adjustments to the fair value of one interest
    rate swap and the four currency forward contracts are included
    in other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheet and other income (expenses) in the consolidated
    statements of operations. The adjustments to fair value for the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are discussed in
    Note 21.

Debt.

The Company’s debt includes both
    fixed and variable rate secured debt, fixed and variable rate
    unsecured debt and credit facilities. The fair value of the
    Company’s fixed rate debt was estimated by discounting the
    future cash flows using market borrowing rates on debt with
    similar terms and maturities. Based on borrowing rates available
    to the Company at December 31, 2010, the book value and the
    estimated fair value of the total debt (both secured and
    unsecured) were $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion,
    respectively.

Debt Premiums and Discounts.

Debt premiums
    (discounts) represent the excess (deficiency) of the fair value
    of debt over the principal value of debt assumed in connection
    with the Company’s initial public offering and subsequent
    property acquisitions. The debt premiums and discounts are being
    amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt
    instrument using the straight-line method, which approximates
    the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the net unamortized debt discount was $(12.6) million
    and

F-18


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$(9.8) million, respectively, and was included as a
    component of secured debt and unsecured senior debt on the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Rental Revenues and Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts.

The Company, as a lessor, retains
    substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of the
    properties and accounts for its leases as operating leases.
    Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    term of the leases. Reimbursements from customers for real
    estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are
    incurred. The Company also records lease termination fees when a
    customer terminates its lease by executing a definitive
    termination agreement with the Company, vacates the premises and
    the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any
    conditions that must be met before the fee is due to the
    Company. In addition, the Company nets its allowance for
    doubtful accounts against rental income for financial reporting
    purposes. Amounts recorded to the allowance for doubtful
    accounts totaled $2.2 million, $6.1 million and
    $3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Private Capital Income.

Private capital income
    consists primarily of acquisition and development fees, asset
    management fees and priority distributions earned by the Company
    from co-investment ventures and clients. Private capital income
    also includes promote interests and incentive distributions from
    the Operating Partnership’s co-investment ventures. The
    Company did not receive incentive distributions during the year
    ended December 31, 2010 and received $2.9 million and
    $33.7 million, respectively, during the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Development Profits, Net of Taxes.

When the
    Company disposes of its real estate entities’ interests,
    gains reported from the sale of these interests represent
    either: (i) the sale of wholly-owned properties or partial
    interests in properties held in consolidated co-investment
    ventures to third-party investors for cash or (ii) the sale
    of partial interests in properties to unconsolidated
    co-investment ventures with third-party investors for cash.

Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate
    Interests.

Gains and losses are recognized using
    the full accrual method. Gains related to transactions which do
    not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of
    accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual
    method of accounting criteria are met. During 2009, the Company
    completed the installment sale of one 0.2 million square
    foot development property and recognized a gain of
    $0.2 million. The remaining gain of $3.9 million
    related to this sale was deferred as of December 31, 2009
    and was recognized in 2010. These gains are presented in
    development profits, net of taxes in the consolidated statements
    of operations.

Other Expenses.

Other expenses consists
    primarily of losses and gains on the Company’s nonqualified
    deferred compensation plan. Additionally, effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance requiring
    acquisition costs related to business combinations, which were
    previously capitalized, to be expensed, and these expenses are
    included in other expenses. The Company will continue to
    capitalize land acquisition costs.

Other Income (Expense).

Other income (expense)
    consists primarily of foreign currency remeasurement losses and
    gains, losses and gains on the Company’s nonqualified
    deferred compensation plan and interest income from mortgages
    receivable and on cash and cash equivalents.

Discontinued Operations.

The Company reported
    real estate dispositions as discontinued operations separately
    as prescribed under the FASB guidance on accounting for the
    impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company
    separately reports as discontinued operations the historical
    operating results attributable to operating properties sold or
    held for sale and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition
    of the properties, which is included in development profits and
    gains from sale of real estate interests, net of taxes, in the
    statement of operations. The consolidated statements of
    operations for prior periods are also retrospectively adjusted
    to conform to new guidance regarding accounting for discontinued
    operations and noncontrolling interests. There is no impact on
    the Company’s previously reported consolidated financial
    position, net income (loss) available to common stockholders or
    cash flows.

Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The Parent
    Company reports comprehensive income (loss) in its consolidated
    statement of equity. The Operating Partnership reports
    comprehensive income (loss) in its consolidated

F-19

statement of capital. Comprehensive income (loss) was
    $71.9 million, $(46.2) million and $4.0 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

International Operations.

The U.S. dollar
    is the functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries
    formed in the United States, Mexico and certain subsidiaries in
    Europe. Other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe,
    the functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries
    operating outside the United States is generally the local
    currency of the country in which the entity or property is
    located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and
    losses on the results of operations. The Company’s
    subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
    U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into
    U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the
    exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. The
    Company translates income statement accounts using the average
    exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring
    transactions using the rate on the transaction date. For the
    Parent Company, these gains (losses) are included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity. For the Operating Partnership, these
    gains (losses) are included in partners’ capital.

The Company’s international subsidiaries may have
    transactions denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currencies. In these instances, non-monetary assets
    and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rates,
    monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange
    rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement
    gain or loss accounts are remeasured at the average exchange
    rate for the period. The Company also records gains or losses in
    the income statement when a transaction with a third party,
    denominated in a currency other than the entity’s
    functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash
    flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the
    exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated.
    These gains (losses) are included in the consolidated statements
    of operations.

Real
    Estate Acquisition and Development Activity

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    acquired two value-added acquisitions totaling approximately
    1.1 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of
    approximately $36.9 million. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company did not acquire any
    properties.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had eight

construction-in-progress

development projects, on an owned and managed basis, which are
    expected to total approximately 2.2 million square feet and
    have an aggregate estimated investment of $169.8 million
    upon completion, net of $1.0 million of cumulative real
    estate impairment losses to date. Four of these projects
    totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet with an
    aggregate estimated investment of $124.2 million were held
    in an unconsolidated co-investment venture.

Construction-in-progress,

at December 31, 2010, included projects expected to be
    completed through the third quarter of 2012.

On a consolidated basis, as of December 31, 2010, the
    Company had an additional 24 pre-stabilized development projects
    totaling approximately 6.6 million square feet, with an
    aggregate estimated investment of $681.3 million, net of
    $67.6 million of cumulative real estate impairment losses
    to date, and an aggregate gross book value of
    $662.0 million, net of cumulative real estate impairment
    losses.

On a consolidated basis, as of December 31, 2010, the
    Company and its development joint venture partners had funded an
    aggregate of $750.9 million, or 94%, of the total estimated
    investment before the impact of real estate impairment losses
    and will need to fund an estimated additional
    $44.6 million, or 6%, in order to complete the
    Company’s development portfolio.

In addition to its committed

construction-in-progress,

the Company held a total of 2,387 acres of land for future
    development or sale, on a consolidated basis, approximately 86%
    of which was located in the Americas. The Company currently
    estimates that these 2,387 acres of land could support
    approximately 43.1 million square feet of future
    development.

The Company’s development portfolio and land inventory does
    not include value-added acquisitions.

Properties Held for Sale or Contribution,
    Net.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company
    held for sale ten properties with an aggregate net book value of
    $55.9 million. These properties either are not in the
    Company’s core markets, do not meet its current investment
    objectives, or are included as part of its

development-for-sale

or value-added conversion programs. The sales of the properties
    are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other
    customary conditions. Properties held for sale are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company held for sale three
    properties with an aggregate net book value of
    $13.9 million.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company held for contribution
    to co-investment ventures eight properties with an aggregate net
    book value of $186.2 million, which, if contributed, will
    reduce the Company’s average ownership interest in these
    projects from approximately 90% to an expected range of less
    than 40%. As of December 31, 2009, the Company held for
    contribution to co-investment ventures 11 properties with an
    aggregate net book value of $200.5 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, no properties were
    reclassified from held for sale or held for contribution to
    investments in real estate as a result of the change in
    management’s intent to hold these assets. In accordance
    with the Company’s policies of accounting for the
    impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, during the year
    ended December 31, 2010, the Company recognized
    $1.2 million additional depreciation expense and

Debt of
    the Parent Company

The Parent Company itself does not hold any indebtedness. All
    debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating
    Partnership. The debt that is guaranteed by the Parent Company
    is discussed below. Note 6 below entitled “Debt of the
    Operating Partnership” should be read in conjunction with
    this Note 5 for a discussion of the debt of the Operating
    Partnership consolidated into the Parent Company’s
    financial statements. In this Note 5, the “Parent
    Company” refers only to AMB Property Corporation and not to
    any of its subsidiaries.

Unsecured
    Senior Debt Guarantees

The Parent Company guarantees the Operating Partnership’s
    obligations with respect to its unsecured senior debt
    securities. As of December 31, 2010, the Operating
    Partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.7 billion in
    unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average
    interest rate of 5.6% and had an average term of 6.1 years.
    The indenture for the senior debt securities contains
    limitations on mergers or consolidations of the Parent Company.

Other
    Debt Guarantees

The Parent Company guarantees the Operating Partnership’s
    obligations with respect to certain of its other debt
    obligations related to the following two facilities. In November
    2010, the Operating Partnership paid off the outstanding Euro
    tranche balance of its original $425.0 million
    multi-currency term loan, which has a maturity of October 2012.
    As of December 31, 2010, only the Japanese Yen tranche of the
    term loan had an outstanding balance, which was approximately
    $153.9 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate in
    effect on that date, and bore a weighted average interest rate
    of 3.4%. Additionally, in November 2010, the Operating
    Partnership entered into a 153.7 million Euro senior
    unsecured term loan, maturing in November 2015. Using the
    exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2010, the term loan
    had an outstanding balance of approximately $205.8 million
    in U.S. dollars, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 2.8%. These term loans contain limitations on the
    incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations
    of the Parent Company.

As of December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership had
    three credit facilities with total capacity of approximately
    $1.7 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion was
    available for future borrowings.

Unsecured
    Credit Facility Guarantees

The Parent Company is a guarantor of the Operating
    Partnership’s obligations under its $600.0 million
    (includes Euro, Yen, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollar or
    U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving
    credit facility. In November 2010, the Operating Partnership
    refinanced its $550.0 million multi-currency facility,
    which was set to mature in June 2011, increasing the facility by
    $50.0 million and extending the maturity to March 2014.
    This facility had no outstanding balance as of December 31,
    2010.

The Parent Company and the Operating Partnership guarantee the
    obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the
    Operating Partnership, under a Yen-denominated unsecured
    revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any
    other entity in which the Operating Partnership directly or
    indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from
    time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit
    agreement. This credit facility has an initial borrowing limit
    of 45.0 billion Yen, previously 55.0 billion prior to

    credit facility maturity was extended from June 2011 to March
    2014. As of December 31, 2010, this facility had a balance
    of $139.5 million, using the exchange rate in effect on
    that date.

The Parent Company and the Operating Partnership guarantee the
    obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled
    by the Operating Partnership that are selected by the Operating
    Partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant
    to a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility.
    The Operating Partnership and certain of its wholly owned
    subsidiaries, each acting as a borrower, and the Parent Company
    and the Operating Partnership, as guarantors, entered into this
    credit facility, which has an option to further increase the
    facility to $800.0 million and to extend the maturity date
    to July 2012. As of December 31, 2010, this facility,
    maturing in July 2011, had a balance of $129.4 million
    using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010 and

Secured debt generally requires monthly principal and interest
    payments. Some of the loans are cross-collateralized by multiple
    properties. The secured debt is collateralized by deeds of
    trust, mortgages or other instruments on certain properties and
    is generally non-recourse. As of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the total gross investment book value of those properties
    securing the debt was $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion,
    respectively, including $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion
    held in consolidated joint ventures, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2010, $695.7 million of the secured debt
    obligations before unamortized net discounts bore interest at
    fixed rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%),
    while the remaining $266.6 million bore interest at
    variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%).

    to the loan agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered
    four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which mature

Income
    Taxes of the Parent Company

The Parent Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code,
    commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1997.
    To qualify as a REIT, the Parent Company must meet a number of
    organizational and operational requirements, including a
    requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its
    taxable income to its stockholders. While historically the
    Parent Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by
    making cash distributions to its stockholders, the Parent
    Company may choose to satisfy this requirement by making
    distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited
    circumstances, its own stock. It is management’s current
    intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the
    Parent Company’s REIT status. As a REIT, the Parent Company
    generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income
    tax on net income it distributes currently to its stockholders.
    As such, no provision for federal income taxes has been included
    in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. If the
    Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year,
    it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate
    rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may
    be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable
    years. Even if the Parent Company qualifies for taxation as a
    REIT, the Parent Company may be subject to certain state and
    local taxes on its income and excise taxes on its undistributed
    taxable income. The Parent Company is required to pay federal
    and state income tax on its net taxable income, if any, from the
    activities conducted by the Parent Company’s taxable REIT
    subsidiaries. Foreign income taxes are accrued for foreign
    countries in which the Parent Company operates, as necessary.

A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences
    in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and
    gain recognition. The Parent Company is required to establish a
    valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is determined,
    based on available evidence at the time the determination is
    made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all
    of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Parent
    Company concluded, based on a review of the relative weight of
    the available evidence, that it was more likely than not that it
    would not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize
    certain deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a valuation allowance
    has been established for most of the Parent Company’s net
    deferred tax asset. The Parent Company will continue to assess
    the need for a valuation allowance in the future.

The Parent Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes, which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for
    uncertain tax positions and seeks to reduce the diversity in
    practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and
    measurement related to accounting for income taxes. The tax
    years 2006 through 2009 remain open to examination by the major
    taxing jurisdictions to which the Parent Company is subject.

At December 31, 2010, the Parent Company recorded a
    liability for an unrecognized tax benefit related to estimated
    Mexico income tax liabilities associated with an acquired
    company of $6.3 million. The liability was originally
    recorded in purchase accounting and became a liability for an
    unrecognized tax benefit in connection with a position taken on
    a 2010 filing. The Parent Company does not expect the liability
    for the unrecognized tax benefit, as described in the table
    below, to increase or decrease in the next 12 months. No
    liability was recorded at December 31, 2009. A
    reconciliation of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is

Income
    Taxes of the Operating Partnership

As a partnership, the allocated share of income of the Operating
    Partnership is included in the income tax returns of its
    partners. Accordingly, no accounting for income taxes is
    required in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
    The Operating Partnership may be subject to certain state, local
    and foreign taxes on its income and property. In addition, the
    Operating Partnership is required to pay federal and state
    income tax on its net taxable income, if any, from the
    activities conducted by the Operating Partnership’s taxable
    REIT subsidiaries. Where the Operating Partnership operates in
    countries other than the United States that do not recognize
    REITs under their respective tax laws, the Operating Partnership
    recognizes income taxes as necessary.

    general partnership units to the Parent Company in exchange for
    the 1,595,337 series D preferred units the Parent Company
    purchased.

The Operating Partnership has consolidated joint ventures that
    have finite lives under the terms of the joint venture
    agreements. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate book
    value of the joint venture noncontrolling interests in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets was approximately
    $325.6 million. The Operating Partnership believes that the
    aggregate settlement value of these interests was approximately
    $426.7 million at December 31, 2010. However, there
    can be no assurance that this will be the aggregate settlement
    value of the interests. The aggregate settlement value is based
    on the estimated liquidation values of the assets and
    liabilities and the resulting proceeds that the Operating
    Partnership would distribute to its joint venture partners upon
    dissolution, as required under the terms of the respective joint
    venture agreements. There can be no assurance that the estimated
    liquidation values of the assets and liabilities and the
    resulting proceeds that the Operating Partnership distributes
    upon dissolution will be the same as the actual liquidation
    values of such assets, liabilities and proceeds distributed upon
    dissolution. Subsequent changes to the estimated fair values of
    the assets and liabilities of the consolidated joint ventures
    will affect the Operating Partnership’s estimate of the
    aggregate settlement value. The joint venture agreements do not
    limit the amount to which the noncontrolling joint venture
    partners would be entitled in the event of liquidation of the
    assets and liabilities and dissolution of the respective joint
    ventures.

    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In accordance with guidance issued by the FASB related to the
    consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIEs”),
    the Company has performed an analysis of all of its joint
    venture entities to determine whether they would qualify as VIEs
    and whether the joint ventures should be consolidated or
    accounted for as an equity investment in an unconsolidated joint
    venture. As a result of the Company’s qualitative
    assessment to determine whether these joint venture entities are
    VIEs, the Company identified five joint venture entities, owned
    in conjunction with the same joint venture partner, which were
    VIEs based upon the criterion of having insufficient equity
    investment at risk. Because these five joint ventures,
    collectively referred to as the “Five Ventures,” have
    partnership and management agreements with the same joint
    venture partner and purposes that are nearly identical, the
    following disclosures are made in the aggregate for all Five
    Ventures. These Five Ventures have been formed as limited
    liability companies with the sole purpose of acquiring,
    developing, improving, maintaining, leasing, marketing and
    selling properties for profit, with the majority of the business
    activities to be financed by third-party debt. In determining
    whether there was sufficient equity investment at risk, the
    Company evaluated the individual balance sheets of the Five
    Ventures by comparing the equity balance as well as the
    outstanding debt balance to the total assets of the Five
    Ventures.

After determining whether any joint ventures are VIEs, the
    Company performs an assessment of which partner would be
    considered the primary beneficiary of the identified VIEs and
    would be required to consolidate the balance sheets and results
    of operations of these entities on a quarterly basis. This
    assessment is based upon which partner (1) had the power to
    direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of
    the VIEs, and (2) had the obligation to absorb losses or
    the right to receive benefits of the VIEs that could potentially
    be significant to the VIE based upon the terms of the
    partnership and management agreements. Both the Company and the
    joint venture partner in the entities had equal 50% ownership in
    the Five Ventures, and per the terms of the partnership
    agreement, they would both have an equal obligation to absorb
    losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIEs. While the
    joint venture partner is designated as the administrative member
    and has the full power to manage the affairs and operations of
    the Five Ventures, the partnership and management agreements
    require consent of both partners for any major decisions, which
    include: the adoption and any subsequent revision of the
    operating budget and business plan; the entry into any
    significant construction, development and property acquisition;
    any capital transaction including sale, financing or refinancing
    of the joint venture property; and the entry into or material
    modification to any lease of the joint venture property. Based
    upon this understanding, the Company concluded that both
    partners shared equal power in the significant decisions of the
    Five Ventures, as well as the financial rights and obligations,
    and therefore neither partner would consolidate the Five
    Ventures. As such, the Company accounts for the Five Ventures as
    an equity investment in unconsolidated joint ventures.

The Company includes the following balances related to the Five
    Ventures, as of December 31, 2010, in Investments in
    unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated balance sheet
    as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands):

Per the partnership agreements for the Five Ventures, the
    Company’s liability is limited to its investment in the
    entities. The Company does not guarantee any third-party debt
    held by these Five Ventures. Capital contributions to the Five
    Ventures subsequent to the initial capital contribution require
    the unanimous approval of both the Company and the joint venture
    partner, and, as of December 31, 2010, the Company has no
    commitment to make additional contributions to the Five Ventures.

    market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock
    of the Parent Company at the time of redemption). The right of
    the holders of common limited partnership units is subject to
    the Operating Partnership or AMB Property II, L.P., in its
    respective sole and absolute discretion, electing to have the
    Parent Company exchange those common limited partnership units
    for shares of the Parent Company’s common stock, whether or
    not such shares are registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
    on a

one-for-one

basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock
    dividends, issuance of certain rights, certain extraordinary
    distributions and similar events. The redemption right is also
    subject to the limits on ownership and transfer of common stock
    set forth in the Parent Company’s charter. With each
    exchange of the Operating Partnership’s common limited
    partnership units for the Parent Company’s common stock,
    the Parent Company’s percentage ownership in the Operating
    Partnership will increase. The redemption right commences on or
    after the first anniversary of a unitholder becoming a limited
    partner of the Operating Partnership or of AMB Property II,
    L.P., as applicable (or such other date agreed to by the
    Operating Partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. and the unit
    holder). During the year ended December 31, 2010, 334,398
    of the Operating Partnership’s common limited partnership
    units were exchanged for shares of the Parent Company’s
    common stock.

The Parent Company has authorized 100,000,000 shares of
    preferred stock for issuance, of which the following series were
    designated as of December 31, 2010: 2,300,000 shares
    of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which
    2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of
    series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are
    outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative
    redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; and
    2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable
    preferred, all of which are outstanding.

The series L, M, O and P preferred stock have preference
    rights with respect to distributions and liquidation over the
    common stock. Holders of the series L, M, O and P preferred
    stock are not entitled to vote on any matters, except under
    certain limited circumstances. In the event of a cumulative
    arrearage equal to six quarterly dividends, holders of the
    series L, M, O and P preferred stock will have the right to
    elect two additional members to serve on the Parent
    Company’s board of directors until dividends have been paid
    in full. At December 31, 2010, there were no dividends in
    arrears. The Parent Company may issue additional series of
    preferred stock ranking on a parity with the series L, M, O
    and P preferred stock, but may not issue any preferred stock
    senior to the series L, M, O and P preferred stock without
    the consent of two-thirds of the holders of each of the
    series L, M, O and P preferred stock. The series L, M,
    O and P preferred stock have no stated maturity and are not
    subject to mandatory redemption or any sinking fund. The
    series L and M preferred stock are redeemable solely at the
    option of the Parent Company, in whole or in part, at $25.00 per
    share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The series O and
    P preferred stock will be redeemable at the option of the Parent
    Company on and after December 13, 2010 and August 25,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Operating Partnership has classified the preferred and
    common units held by outside parties and by the Parent Company
    as permanent equity based on the following considerations:

•

The Operating Partnership determined that settlement in the
    Parent Company’s stock is equivalent to settlement in
    equity of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company’s
    only significant asset is its interest in the Operating
    Partnership and the Parent Company conducts substantially all of
    its business through the Operating Partnership. The Parent
    Company’s stock is the economic equivalent of the Operating
    Partnership’s corresponding units. The Company has
    concluded that a redemption and issuance of shares in exchange
    for units does not represent a delivery of assets.

•

In accordance with the guidance for Contracts in Entity’s
    Own Equity, the Operating Partnership, as the issuer of the
    units, controls the settlement options of the redemption of the
    units (shares or cash). Pursuant to an assignment agreement, the
    Parent Company has transferred to the Operating Partnership the
    right to elect to acquire some or all of any tendered units from
    the tendering partner in exchange for stock of the Parent
    Company. The unitholder has no control over whether it receives
    cash or Parent Company stock. There are no factors outside the
    issuer’s control that could impact those settlement options
    and there are no provisions that could require cash settlement
    upon redemption of units. The Operating Partnership units that
    are held by the Parent Company are redeemable only to maintain
    the 1:1 ratio of outstanding shares of the Parent Company to the
    outstanding units of the Operating Partnership and to facilitate
    the transfer of cash to the Parent Company from the Operating
    Partnership upon redemption of Parent Company stock. The Parent
    Company and the Operating Partnership are structured and
    operated as one interrelated, consolidated business under a
    single management. The decision to pay cash or have the Parent
    Company issue registered or unregistered shares of stock is made
    by a single management team acting for both the Operating
    Partnership and the Parent Company and causing the entities to
    act in concert.

•

Management has concluded that there is no conflict in fiduciary
    duty or interest with respect to the decision to settle a
    redemption request in cash or common shares of the Parent
    Company.

As of December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership had
    outstanding 168,506,670 common general partnership units;
    2,058,730 common limited partnership units; 2,000,000 6.5%
    series L cumulative redeemable preferred units; 2,300,000
    6.75% series M cumulative redeemable preferred units;
    3,000,000 7.00% series O cumulative redeemable preferred
    units; and 2,000,000 6.85% series P cumulative redeemable

The net proceeds from the Parent Company’s April 2010
    offering of approximately 18.2 million shares of its common
    stock were contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange
    for the issuance of 18.2 million general partnership units
    to the Parent Company. The proceeds were approximately
    $479.0 million, net of discounts, commissions and estimated
    transaction expenses of approximately $18.1 million.

Stock
    Incentive Plan, 401(k) Plan and Deferred Compensation
    Plan

Stock Incentive Plans.

The Company has stock
    option and incentive plans (“Stock Incentive Plans”)
    for the purpose of attracting and retaining eligible officers,
    directors and employees. The Company has authorized for issuance
    17,500,000 shares of common stock under its 2002 stock
    incentive plan of which 4,014,453 shares were remaining
    available for grant and 8,347,527 shares were reserved for
    issuance at December 31, 2010. As of December 31,
    2010, the Company had 8,694,938 non-qualified options
    outstanding granted to certain directors, officers and employees
    which includes 431,426 shares of common stock reserved for
    issuance for outstanding option grants under its 1997 stock
    incentive plan which expired in November 2007. Each option is
    exchangeable for one share of the Company’s common stock.
    Each option’s exercise price is equal to the Company’s
    market price on the date of grant. The options have an original
    ten-year term and generally vest pro rata in annual installments
    over a three to five-year period from the date of grant.

For each share of common stock the Parent Company issues
    pursuant to the Parent Company and Operating Partnership’s
    Stock Incentive Plans, the Operating Partnership will issue a
    corresponding common partnership unit to the Parent Company. As
    of December 31, 2010, the Stock Incentive Plans have
    approximately 4.0 million shares of common stock available
    for issuance as either stock options or restricted stock grants.
    The fair value of each option grant is generally estimated at
    the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
    The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and
    forfeitures within the valuation model. Expected volatilities
    are based on historical volatility of the Parent Company’s
    stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life
    of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
    effect at the time of the grant.

The Company values stock options using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model and recognizes this value as an expense
    over the vesting periods. Under this guidance, recognition of
    expense for stock options is applied to all options granted
    after the beginning of the year of adoption. In accordance with
    the adopted guidance, the Company will recognize the associated
    expense over the three to five-year vesting periods.
    Additionally, the Company awards restricted stock and recognizes
    this value as an expense over the vesting periods. As of
    December 31, 2010, there was $24.4 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based
    compensation arrangements granted under the Stock Incentive
    Plans. Of this total, $5.6 million of unrecognized
    compensation cost related to stock options and
    $18.8 million related to restricted stock awards is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    1.5 years and 2.3 years, respectively.

The following table summarizes stock option expense and
    restricted stock expense, included in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

The FASB guidance requires the cash flows resulting from tax
    benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the
    compensation cost recognized for those options (excess tax
    benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. The Company
    does not have any such excess tax benefits.

During 2010, the Parent Company issued 85,144 restricted share
    units (“RSUs”), of which 84,015 RSUs are outstanding
    as of December 31, 2010. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, 1,129 RSUs were forfeited. RSUs are
    granted to certain employees at a rate of one common share per
    RSU and are valued on the grant date based upon the market price
    of a common share on that date. The value of the RSUs granted is
    recognized as compensation expense over the applicable vesting
    period, which is generally four years. Holders of RSUs do not
    receive voting rights, nor are they eligible to receive
    dividends declared on outstanding shares of common stock, during
    the vesting period. Shares of common stock equivalent to the
    number of RSUs granted are reserved for issuance until vesting
    of the RSUs has completed. The weighted-average grant date fair
    value of RSUs granted during the year ended December 31,
    2010 was $22.14.

401(k) Plan.

In November 1997, the Company
    established a Section 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan
    (the “401(k) Plan”), which is a continuation of the
    401(k) Plan of the Company’s predecessor, to cover eligible
    employees of the Company. The 401(k) Plan permits eligible
    employees to defer up to 75% of their annual compensation (as
    adjusted under the terms of the 401(k) Plan), subject to certain
    limitations imposed by the Code. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company matched employee contributions under the 401(k) Plan in
    an amount

F-46


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

equal to 50% of the first 6.0% of annual compensation deferred
    by each employee, up to a maximum match of $7,350, $7,350 and
    $6,900 per year, respectively, for each participating employee.
    In the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company made matching contributions of $1.0 million,
    $0.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The
    Company may also make discretionary contributions to the 401(k)
    Plan. No discretionary contributions were made by the Company to
    the 401(k) Plan in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008.

The employees’ elective deferrals are immediately vested
    and non-forfeitable upon contribution to the 401(k) Plan.
    Matching contributions made by the Company vest fully one year
    after the commencement of an employee’s employment with the
    Company.

Deferred Compensation Plans.

The Company has
    established two non-qualified deferred compensation plans for
    eligible officers and directors of the Company and certain of
    its affiliates, which enable eligible participants to defer
    income from their U.S. payroll up to 100% of annual base
    pay, up to 100% of annual bonuses, up to 100% of their meeting
    fees

and/or

committee chairmanship fees, and up to 100% of certain
    equity-based compensation, as applicable, subject to
    restrictions, on a pre-tax basis. This deferred compensation is
    an unsecured obligation of the Company. The Company may make
    discretionary matching contributions to participant accounts at
    any time. The Company made no such discretionary matching
    contributions in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008. The participant’s elective deferrals and any
    matching contributions are immediately 100% vested. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the total fair value of
    compensation deferred was $76.2 million and
    $66.2 million, respectively, including $57.0 million
    and $43.3 million, respectively, of the Company common
    stock.

Income
    (Loss) Per Share and Unit

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted a policy
    which clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle
    their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting
    should be considered participating securities. As participating
    securities, these instruments should be included in the
    computation of earnings per share (“EPS”) using the
    two-class method.

Segment
    Information

The Company has two lines of business: real estate operations
    and private capital. Real estate operations is comprised of
    various segments while private capital consists of a single
    reportable segment, on which the Company evaluates its
    performance:

•

Real Estate Operations.

The Company operates
    industrial properties and manages its business by geographic
    markets. Such industrial properties are typically comprised of
    multiple distribution warehouse

F-49


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

facilities suitable for single or multiple customers who are
    engaged in various types of businesses. The geographic markets
    where the Company owns industrial properties are managed
    separately because it believes each market has its own economic
    characteristics and requires its own operating, pricing and
    leasing strategies. Each market is considered to be an
    individual operating segment. The accounting policies of the
    segments are the same as those described in the summary of
    significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates
    performance based upon property net operating income of the
    combined properties in each segment, which are listed below. In
    addition, the Company’s development business is included
    under real estate operations. It primarily consists of the
    Company’s development of real estate properties that are
    subsequently contributed to a co-investment venture fund in
    which the Company has an ownership interest and for which the
    Company acts as manager, or that are sold to third parties. The
    Company evaluates performance of the development business by
    reported operating segment based upon gains generated from the
    disposition

and/or

contribution of real estate. The assets of the development
    business generally include properties under development and land
    held for development. During the period between the completion
    of development of a property and the date the property is
    contributed to an unconsolidated co-investment venture or sold
    to a third party, the property and its associated rental income
    and property operating costs are included in the real estate
    operations segment because the primary activity associated with
    the property during that period is leasing. Upon contribution or
    sale, the resulting gain or loss is included as gains from sale
    or contribution of real estate interests or development profits,
    as appropriate.

•

Private Capital.

The Company, through its
    private capital group, AMB Capital Partners, LLC (“AMB
    Capital Partners”), provides real estate investment,
    portfolio management and reporting services to

co-investment

ventures and clients. The private capital income earned consists
    of acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and
    priority distributions, and promote interests and incentive
    distributions from the Company’s co-investment ventures and
    AMB Capital Partners’ clients. With respect to the
    Company’s U.S. and Mexico funds and co-investment
    ventures, the Company typically earns a 90.0 basis points
    acquisition fee on the acquisition cost of third party
    acquisitions, asset management priority distributions of 7.5% of
    net operating income on stabilized properties, 70.0 basis
    points of total projected costs as asset management fees on
    renovation or development properties, and incentive
    distributions of 15% of the return over a 9% internal rate of
    return and 20% of the return over a 12% internal rate of return
    to investors on a periodic basis or at the end of a fund’s
    life. In Japan, the Company earns a 90.0 basis points
    acquisition fee on the acquisition cost of third-party
    acquisitions, asset management priority distributions of 1.5% of
    unreturned equity, and incentive distributions of 20% of the
    return over a 10% internal rate of return and 25% of the return
    over a 13% internal rate of return to investors at the end of a
    fund’s life. In Europe, the Company earns a 90.0 basis
    points acquisition fee on the acquisition cost of third-party
    acquisitions, asset management fees of 75.0 basis points on
    the gross asset value of the fund, and incentive distributions
    of 20% of the return over a 9% internal rate of return and 25%
    of the return over a 12% internal rate of return to investors on
    a periodic basis. In Brazil, the Company earns asset management
    priority distributions of 1.5% of unreturned equity, incentive
    distributions of 20% of the return over a 10% internal rate of
    return, 60% of the return over a 13% and up to a 20% internal
    rate of return, 100% to an agreed threshold over a 20% internal
    rate of return, and 20% above that threshold. The accounting
    policies of the segment are the same as those described in the
    summary of significant accounting policies under Note 2 of
    this document.

(2)

Property net operating income (“NOI”) is defined as
    rental revenues, including reimbursements, less property
    operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation, amortization,
    general and administrative expenses, restructuring charges, real
    estate impairment losses, debt extinguishment losses,
    development profits (losses), gains (losses) from sale or
    contribution of real estate interests, and interest expense. The
    Company believes that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the
    most appropriate earnings measure. However, NOI is a useful
    supplemental measure calculated to help investors understand the
    Company’s operating performance, excluding the effects of
    gains (losses), costs and expenses which are not related to the
    performance of the assets. NOI is widely used by the real estate
    industry as a useful supplemental measure, which helps investors
    compare the Company’s operating performance with that of
    other companies. Real estate impairment losses have been
    excluded in deriving NOI because the Company does not consider
    its impairment losses to be a property operating expense. The
    Company believes that the exclusion of impairment losses from
    NOI is a common methodology used in the real estate industry.
    Real estate impairment losses relate to the changing values of
    the Company’s assets but do not reflect the current
    operating performance of the assets with respect to their
    revenues or expenses. The Company’s real estate impairment
    losses are non-cash charges which represent the write down in
    the value of assets when estimated fair value over the holding
    period is lower than current carrying value. The impairment
    charges were principally a result of increases in estimated
    capitalization rates and deterioration in market conditions that
    adversely impacted underlying real estate values. Therefore, the
    impairment charges are not related to the current performance of
    the Company’s real estate operations and should be excluded
    from its calculation of NOI.

In addition, the Company believes that NOI helps investors
    compare the operating performance of its real estate as compared
    to other companies. While NOI is a relevant and widely used
    measure of operating performance

F-51

    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash
    flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should
    not be considered as an alternative to those measures in
    evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating
    performance. NOI also does not reflect general and
    administrative expenses, interest expenses, real estate
    impairment losses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital
    expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and
    construction activities that could materially impact the
    Company’s results from operations. Further, the
    Company’s computation of NOI may not be comparable to that
    of other real estate companies, as they may use different
    methodologies for calculating NOI. For a reconciliation of NOI
    to net income, see the table below.

The following table is a reconciliation from NOI to reported net
    income (loss), a financial measure under GAAP (dollars in

Standby Letters of Credit.

As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company had provided approximately
    $12.9 million in letters of credit, of which
    $10.4 million was provided under the Operating
    Partnership’s $600.0 million unsecured credit
    facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under
    certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other
    commitments.

Guarantees and Contribution
    Obligations.

Excluding parent guarantees
    associated with debt or contribution obligations as discussed in
    Notes 5, 6 and 12 above, as of December 31, 2010, the
    Company had outstanding guarantees and contribution obligations
    in the aggregate amount of $403.0 million as described
    below.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding bank
    guarantees in the amount of $0.3 million used to secure
    contingent obligations, primarily obligations under development
    and purchase agreements. As of

F-53


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2010, the Company also guaranteed
    $58.6 million and $83.5 million on outstanding loans
    on five of its consolidated joint ventures and three of its
    unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively.

Also, the Company has entered into contribution agreements with
    its unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These contribution
    agreements require the Company to make additional capital
    contributions to the applicable

co-investment

venture upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of
    certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional
    capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than the Company’s share of the co-investment
    venture’s debt obligation or the value of its share of any
    property securing such debt. The Company’s contribution
    obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the
    amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the
    property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the
    lender upon default. The Company’s potential obligations
    under these contribution agreements totaled $260.6 million
    as of December 31, 2010.

Performance and Surety Bonds.

As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding performance
    and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $3.8 million.
    These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its
    development projects and were posted to guarantee certain
    property tax obligations and the construction of certain real
    property improvements and infrastructure. The performance and
    surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the
    property taxes due or the completion of the improvements and
    infrastructure.

Promote Interests and Other Contractual
    Obligations.

Upon the achievement of certain
    return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, the
    Company may be obligated to make payments to certain of its
    joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of
    their contractual agreements with the Operating Partnership.
    From time to time in the normal course of the Company’s
    business, the Company enters into various contracts with third
    parties that may obligate it to make payments, pay promotes or
    perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.

Contingencies

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Company may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its properties and
    its other business activities. Management does not expect that
    the liabilities, if any, that may ultimately result from such
    legal actions will have a material adverse effect on the
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters.

The Company monitors
    its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic
    substances. The Company is not aware of any environmental
    liability with respect to the properties that would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business, assets
    or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance
    that such a material environmental liability does not exist. The
    existence of any such material environmental liability would
    have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations and cash flow. The Company carries environmental
    insurance and believes that the policy terms, conditions, limits
    and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the
    circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the cost of such
    coverage and current industry practice.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Company carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood and terrorism
    insurance. The Company believes that the policy terms,
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and current industry practice. In
    addition, a significant number of the Company’s properties
    are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. As
    a result, the Company has obtained limited earthquake insurance
    on those properties. There are, however, certain types of
    extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war, that may
    be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although
    the Company has obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism,
    with policy specifications and insured limits that it believes
    are commercially reasonable, there can be no assurance that the
    Company will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Company could lose its investment in,
    and anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property.

Captive Insurance Company.

The Company has a
    wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National
    Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for
    all or a portion of losses below the attachment point of the
    Company’s third-party insurance policies. The captive
    insurance company is one element of the Company’s overall
    risk management program. The Company capitalized Arcata in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    establishes annual premiums based on projections derived from
    the past loss experience at the Company’s properties. Like
    premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid
    to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific
    lease terms. Through this structure, the Company believes that
    it has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower
    cost than would otherwise be available in the market.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

Risk
    Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its
    business operations and economic conditions. The Company
    principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business
    and operational risks through management of its core business
    activities. The Company manages economic risks, including
    interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing
    the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the
    use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the
    Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage
    exposures that arise from business activities that result in the
    receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts,
    the value of which are determined by interest rates. The
    Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to
    manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the
    Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or
    expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s
    borrowings. The Company’s derivative financial instruments
    in effect at December 31, 2010 used to manage these
    exposures and differences were 24 outstanding interest rate
    swaps and one interest rate cap hedging cash flows of variable
    rate borrowings based on USD Libor, Euribor (EUR), JPY Tibor and
    JPY Libor.

Certain of the Company’s foreign operations expose the
    Company to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange
    rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of the
    Company’s cash receipts and payments in terms of the
    Company’s functional currency. The Company enters into
    derivative financial instruments to protect the value or fix the
    amount of certain obligations in terms of its functional
    currency, the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2010, the
    Company had four foreign exchange forward contracts hedging
    intercompany loans.

Cash Flow
    Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives
    are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its
    exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this
    objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and
    caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
    Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the
    receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange
    for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the
    agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
    Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the
    receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest
    rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for
    an upfront premium.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
    derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is
    recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a
    separate component of stockholders’ equity for the Parent
    Company and within partners’ capital for the Operating
    Partnership and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in
    the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects
    earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2010, such
    derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows
    associated with existing variable-rate borrowings.

Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)
    income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest
    expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s
    variable-rate borrowings. For the next twelve months from
    December 31, 2010, the Company estimates that an additional
    $1.2 million will be reclassified as an increase to
    interest expense.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had the following
    outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as
    cash flow hedges of interest rate risk:

Non-designated
    Derivatives

Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are
    used to manage the Company’s exposure to identified risks,
    such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, but do not
    meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of the accounting
    policy for derivative instruments and hedging activities. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company had four foreign exchange
    forward contracts hedging intercompany loans and one interest
    rate swap hedging a construction loan and other variable rate
    borrowings which were not designated as hedges. Changes in the
    fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging
    relationships are recorded directly in earnings and are offset
    by changes in the fair value of the underlying assets or
    liabilities being hedged, which are also recorded in earnings.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had the following

Credit-risk-related
    Contingent Features

In order to limit the financial risks associated with derivative
    applications, the Company requires rigorous counterparty
    selection criteria and agreements to minimize counterparty risk
    for

over-the-counter

derivatives. For the Company’s derivatives, the
    counterparty is typically the same entity as, or an affiliate
    of, the lender.

The Company’s agreements with its derivative counterparties
    contain default and termination provisions related to the
    Company’s debt. If certain of the Company’s
    indebtedness (excluding its corporate lines of credit and
    intra-company indebtedness) in an amount in excess of three
    percent of the Company’s equity, as determined at the end
    of the last fiscal year, becomes, or becomes capable of being
    declared, due and payable earlier than it otherwise would have
    been, then the Company could also be declared in default on its
    derivative obligations. Also, if an event of default occurs
    under the Company’s corporate lines of credit and, as a
    result, amounts outstanding under such lines are declared or
    become due and payable in an amount in excess of three percent
    of the Company’s equity, as determined at the end of the
    last fiscal year, it shall constitute an additional termination
    event under the derivative contracts.

Subsequent
    Events

On January 30, 2011, the Parent Company and the Operating
    Partnership entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
    “merger agreement”) with ProLogis, a Maryland real
    estate investment trust, New Pumpkin Inc., a Maryland
    corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ProLogis, Upper
    Pumpkin LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly
    owned subsidiary of New Pumpkin, and Pumpkin LLC, a Delaware
    limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Upper
    Pumpkin. The merger agreement provides for a merger of equals,
    in which, through a series of transactions, ProLogis and its
    newly formed subsidiaries will be merged with and into the
    Parent Company (the “merger”), with the Parent Company
    continuing as the surviving corporation with its corporate name
    changed to “ProLogis Inc.” As a result of the mergers,
    each outstanding common share of beneficial interest of ProLogis
    will be converted into the right to receive 0.4464 of a newly
    issued share of common stock of the Parent Company. The merger
    is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of
    approval of Parent Company stockholders and ProLogis
    shareholders.

The merger agreement provides that, upon the consummation of the
    merger, the board of directors of the surviving corporation will
    consist of 11 members, as follows: (i) Mr. Hamid R.
    Moghadam, the current chief executive officer of the Parent
    Company, (ii) Mr. Walter C. Rakowich, the current
    chief executive officer of ProLogis, (iii) four individuals
    to be selected by the current members of the board of directors
    of the Parent Company, and (iv) five individuals to be
    selected by the current members of the board of trustees of
    ProLogis. In addition, upon the consummation of the merger,
    (a) Mr. Moghadam and Mr. Rakowich will become
    co-chief executive officers of the surviving corporation,
    (b) Mr. William E. Sullivan, the current chief
    financial officer of ProLogis, will become the chief financial
    officer of the surviving corporation, (c) Mr. Irving
    F. Lyons, III, a current member of the board of trustees of
    ProLogis, will become the lead independent director of the
    surviving corporation, (d) Mr. Moghadam will become
    the chairman of the board of directors of the surviving
    corporation and (e) Mr. Rakowich will become the
    chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors of
    the surviving corporation.

The merger agreement also provides that, on December 31,
    2012, (i) unless earlier terminated in accordance with the
    bylaws of the surviving corporation, the employment of
    Mr. Rakowich as co-chief executive officer will terminate
    and Mr. Rakowich will thereupon retire as co-chief
    executive officer and as a director of the surviving
    corporation, and Mr. Moghadam will become the sole chief
    executive officer (and will remain the chairman of the board of
    directors) of the surviving corporation, and (ii) unless
    earlier terminated, the employment of Mr. Sullivan as the
    chief financial officer of the surviving corporation will
    terminate and Mr. Thomas S. Olinger, the current chief
    financial officer of the Parent Company, will become the chief
    financial officer of the surviving corporation.

The Parent Company and the Operating Partnership have been named
    as defendants in at least two pending putative shareholder class
    actions filed in the Denver County District Court, Colorado, in
    connection with the merger of the Parent Company and ProLogis:

James Kinsey, et al. v. ProLogis, et al.,

no. 2011CV818, filed on or

F-63


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

about February 2, 2011 in the Denver County District Court,
    Colorado; and

Vernon C. Burrows, et al. v. ProLogis, et
    al.,

filed on or about February 15, 2011, in the
    Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore City. The complaints
    seek to enjoin the merger, alleging, among other things, that
    ProLogis’ directors and certain executive officers breached
    their fiduciary duties by failing to maximize the value to be
    received by ProLogis shareholders and by improperly considering
    certain directors’ personal interests in the transaction in
    determining whether to enter into the merger agreement. The
    Maryland complaint also includes a derivative claim on behalf of
    ProLogis based upon the same allegations. Both complaints also
    assert a claim of aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary
    duties against ProLogis, the Parent Company and the merger
    entities. The Colorado complaint also asserts a claim of aiding
    and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties against the Operating
    Partnership. In addition to an order enjoining the transaction,
    the complaints seek, among other things, attorneys’ fees
    and expenses, and the Maryland complaint further seeks certain
    monetary damages. The Parent Company and the Operating
    Partnership view the complaints to be without merit and intend
    to defend against them vigorously.

ORGANIZATION

On September 17, 2003, AMB Property, L.P. (“AMB”)
    formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, LLC
    (“Alliance Fund III, LLC”), a Delaware limited
    liability Fund. On October 25, 2004, AMB converted Alliance
    Fund III, LLC into a limited partnership, AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. (“USLF”), a Delaware
    limited partnership, formerly known as AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P. (“Fund III”), and
    admitted AMB U.S. Logistics REIT, Inc. (“USLR”),
    formerly known as AMB Institutional Alliance REIT III, Inc.
    (“REIT III”) into USLF as a limited partner. Due to
    the related party nature of the conversion, and that USLF was
    under common control with Alliance Fund III, LLC, the
    assets and liabilities were accounted for by USLF at historical
    cost.

On October 26, 2004 (“Inception”), USLF completed
    its first closing and accepted capital contributions from AMB
    Property, L.P. and USLR. On November 1, 2006, AMB Property
    II, L.P. was admitted to USLF as a limited partner in exchange
    for a contribution of 16 industrial buildings with an estimated
    value of $111.9 million. On January 4, 2008, AMB HFC,
    L.P. was admitted to USLF as a limited partner in exchange for a
    contribution of two industrial buildings with an estimated value
    of $86.8 million. AMB Property, L.P., AMB Property II, L.P.
    and AMB HFC, L.P. are herein referred to as “AMB.” On
    July 1, 2008, the City and County of San Francisco
    Employees’ Retirement System (“CCSFERS”) and AMB
    contributed their partnership interests in AMB Partners II, L.P.
    (“Partners II”) to USLF in exchange for partnership
    interests in USLF. As of December 31, 2010, USLF has
    accepted capital contributions from AMB, CCSFERS and USLR
    (excluding AMB Property, L.P.’s interest), and
    contributions resulting from USLF’s dividend reinvestment
    program, for ownership interests in USLF of 34.9 percent,
    21.6 percent and 43.5 percent, respectively. AMB is a
    general and limited partner of USLF. As of December 31,
    2010, all capital balances reflect balances at liquidation value.

As of December 31, 2010, $71.5 million of USLR units
    in USLF have been redeemed.

Effective January 25, 2010 Fund III, REIT III and AMB
    Fund III Holdings, L.P. changed their legal names. These
    legal name changes do not involve a change of control or other
    change in the ownership percentages of these entities. All other
    USLF related and subsidiary entities remain as is. Legal name
    changes are as follows:

Former Names:

Effective Names:

AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P.  (“USLF”)

AMB Institutional Alliance REIT III, Inc.

AMB U.S. Logistics REIT, Inc. (“USLR”)

AMB Fund III Holdings, L.P.

AMB U.S. Logistics Fund Holdings, L.P. (“USLFH”)

As of December 31, 2010, USLF owned 129 operating
    properties and two renovation properties (consisting of 313
    industrial buildings aggregating 38.2 million square feet
    (unaudited)) and two parcels of land held for future development
    (the “Properties”). The Properties are located in the
    following markets: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore/Washington DC,
    Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, Northern New
    Jersey/New York, Orlando, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle,
    South Florida, and Southern California.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of USLF and the ventures in which
    USLF has a controlling interest. Third-party equity interests in
    USLF’s ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests
    in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All
    significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of

S-14


AMB U.S.
    LOGISTICS FUND, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
    statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to
    the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its
    estimated fair value.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local airport
    authorities, and subject to ground leases are depreciated over
    the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the
    underlying ground lease. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building costs on ground leases

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

Prior to January 1, 2009, the initial cost of buildings and
    improvements included the purchase price of the property or
    interest in the property including legal fees and acquisition
    costs. Pursuant to USLF’s adoption of policies related to
    accounting for business combinations, legal fees and acquisition
    costs are now expensed and included in other expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Project costs associated with the development and construction
    of a real estate project, which include interest and property
    taxes, are capitalized as construction in progress. For the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, USLF capitalized
    interest and property taxes of approximately $1.9 million
    and $0.4 million, respectively.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

USLF records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for
    the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2010, USLF has recorded intangible assets or
    liabilities in the amounts of $16.9 million,
    $42.6 million, $42.3 million, and $82.3 million
    for the value attributable to above-market leases, below-market
    leases, in-place leases, and lease origination costs,
    respectively, which are included in buildings and improvements
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of
    December 31, 2009, USLF has recorded intangible assets or
    liabilities in the amounts of $12.7 million,
    $39.1 million, $38.2 million, and $78.1 million
    for the value attributable to above-market leases, below-market
    leases, in-place leases, and lease origination costs,
    respectively, which are included in buildings and improvements
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

USLF also records at acquisition an asset or liability for the
    value attributable to above- or below-market assumed mortgage
    loans payable. As of both December 31, 2010 and 2009, USLF
    has recorded $1.0 million for net above- and below-market
    assumed mortgage loans payable.

Real Estate Impairment Losses.

The Fund
    conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes
    in accordance with its policy of accounting for the impairment
    or disposal of long-lived assets, which indicates that asset
    values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may
    not be fully recoverable. The intended use of an asset, either
    held for sale or held for the long term, can significantly
    impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is intended to be
    held for the long term, the impairment analysis is based on a
    two-step test. If there has been a triggering event, which may
    include a decline in fair value below carrying value, then a
    test is performed to compare estimated future cash flows over
    the holding period,

S-15


AMB U.S.
    LOGISTICS FUND, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

including a residual value (undiscounted and without interest
    charges), against the carrying value of the property. If the
    asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is measured
    against the estimated fair value from a market participant
    standpoint, with the excess of the asset’s carrying value
    over the estimated fair value recognized as an impairment charge
    to earnings. If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is
    tested based on a one-step test, comparing the carrying value to
    the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of
    expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and
    relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and
    market conditions and the availability of capital. The Fund
    determines the estimated fair values based on assumptions
    regarding rental rates, costs to complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values.
    During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Fund
    recognized $5.3 million and $11.4 million of real
    estate impairment charges.

Discontinued Operations.

USLF reports its
    property sales as discontinued operations separately as
    prescribed under its policy of accounting for the disposal of
    long-lived assets, which requires USLF to separately report as
    discontinued operations the historical operating results
    attributable to properties held for divestiture or operating
    properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the
    disposition of the properties. Although this application may
    affect the presentation of USLF’s consolidated results of
    operations for the periods that it has already reported, there
    will be no effect on its previously reported consolidated
    financial position, net income or cash flows.

The following summarizes the condensed results of operations of
    the properties sold for the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively:

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with reserves from loan proceeds
    for certain capital improvements and real estate tax payments.
    Restricted cash also includes cash held by third parties as
    collateral for certain letters of credit. As of both
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, USLF had two letters of credit
    outstanding totaling $0.2 million. These letters of credit
    are for security deposits on ground leases.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related mortgage loans payable. As of
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, deferred
    financing costs were $6.4 million and $6.8 million,
    respectively, net of accumulated amortization.

Mortgage Premiums and Discounts.

Mortgage
    premiums and discounts represent the difference between the fair
    value of debt and the principal value of debt assumed in
    connection with acquisitions. The mortgage premiums and
    discounts are being amortized into interest expense over the
    term of the related debt instrument using the effective-interest
    method. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the net
    unamortized mortgage discounts and (premiums) were approximately
    $4.6 million and $4.7 million, respectively.

S-16


AMB U.S.
    LOGISTICS FUND, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent interests held by an affiliate of AMB and
    third-party investors in various USLF entities. Such investments
    are consolidated because USLF owns a majority interest and
    exercises control through the ability to control major operating
    decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    USLF are allocated to each of the partners in accordance with
    the partnership agreement. Partner distributions, if any, are
    made quarterly. Distributions, other than priority distributions
    (Note 8), are paid or accrued to each of the partners in
    accordance with their respective partnership units owned at the
    time distributions are declared.

On January 1, 2005, USLF issued 125 Series A preferred
    units at a price of $1,000 per unit, which are held by USLR.
    USLR in turn issued 125 shares of Series A preferred
    stock at a price of $1,000 per share. The Series A
    preferred stock is 12.5 percent cumulative non-voting
    preferred stock, callable with a premium based on the period of
    time the stock has been outstanding. The call premium was
    15.0 percent through December 31, 2007. The premium
    will reduce each year thereafter by 5.0 percent per year
    such that there will be no premium after December 31, 2009.
    Dividends are payable on June 30 and December 31 of each year.

Rental Revenues.

USLF, as a lessor, retains
    substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of the
    Properties and accounts for its leases as operating leases.
    Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for real estate
    taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as
    revenue in the period that the applicable expenses are incurred.
    In addition, USLF nets its bad debt expense against rental
    income for financial reporting purposes. Such amounts totaled
    approximately $1.5 million and $2.1 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. USLF
    recorded net $3.6 million and $4.1 million of income
    related to amortization of lease intangibles for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of the net
    $3.6 million recorded for the year ended December 31,
    2010, $1.2 million relates to amortization expense of
    above-market leases and $4.8 million relates to
    amortization income of below-market leases, respectively. Of the
    net $4.1 million recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, $2.4 million relates to
    amortization expense of above-market leases and
    $6.5 million relates to amortization income of below-market
    leases, respectively. The lease intangibles are being amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Gains from Sale.

Gains and losses are
    recognized using the full accrual method. Gains related to
    transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full
    accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when
    the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with USLF in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on USLF’s ability to lease space and on the
    level of rent that can be achieved. As of December 31,
    2010, USLF did not have any material concentration of credit
    risk due to the diversification of its tenants.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

As of
    December 31, 2010, USLF’s consolidated financial
    instruments include mortgage loans payable and a secured credit
    facility. Based on borrowing rates available to USLF at
    December 31, 2010, the estimated fair value of the mortgage
    loans payable and the secured credit facility, using
    level 2 inputs as described below, was $1.6 billion.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued guidance related to accounting for
    fair value measurements which defines fair value and establishes
    a framework for measuring fair value in order to meet disclosure
    requirements for fair value measurements. Fair value is defined
    as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
    paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or
    most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. This guidance also establishes a fair value
    hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value. This hierarchy describes three levels
    of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Financial and non-financial assets and liabilities recorded on
    the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the
    inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
    liabilities include debt and equity securities for which
    instrument valuations are obtained from real-time quotes for
    transactions in active exchange markets involving assets
    identical assets.

Level 2.

Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities
    include derivative contracts whose value is determined using a
    pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or
    can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data where applicable, such as equity prices,
    interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency rates
    and counterparty credit risk.

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation using
    unobservable inputs. For the real estate assets included in
    Level 3, the Fund used the market participant pricing
    approach, which estimates what a potential buyer would pay
    today. The key inputs used in the model included the Fund’s
    intent to sell, hold or contribute, along with capitalization
    and rental growth rate assumptions, estimated costs to complete
    and expected lease up and holding periods. When available,
    current market information, like comparative sales price, was
    used to determine capitalization and rental growth rates. When
    market information was not readily available, the inputs were
    based on the Fund’s understanding of market conditions and
    the experience of the management team.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In June 2009,
    the FASB issued amended guidance related to the consolidation of
    variable-interest entities. These amendments require an
    enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the
    primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”) based on whether the entity (1) has the
    power to direct matters that most significantly impact the
    activities of the VIE, and (2) has the obligation to absorb
    losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could
    potentially be significant to the VIE. Additionally, they
    require an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary
    and provide a framework for the events that trigger a
    reassessment of whether an entity is a VIE. This guidance is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2009, and USLF has adopted
    this guidance as of January 1, 2010. USLF has evaluated the
    impact of the adoption of this guidance, and it did not have a
    material impact on USLF’s financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

    industrial buildings totaling 2.2 million square feet
    (unaudited). The total aggregate investment was approximately
    $171.8 million. The $171.8 million total purchase
    price related to these acquisitions was allocated
    $55.3 million to land, $105.2 million to buildings and
    improvements, $3.7 million to in-place leases,
    $3.6 million to lease origination costs, and
    $4.0 million to above-market leases.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, USLF acquired two
    industrial buildings totaling 428,180 square feet
    (unaudited). The total aggregate investment was approximately
    $32.5 million. The $32.5 million total purchase price
    related to these acquisitions was allocated $5.0 million to
    land, $22.1 million to buildings and improvements,
    $0.7 million to in-place leases, and $4.7 million to
    lease origination costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, USLF disposed of
    eight industrial buildings totaling 660,725 square feet

DEBT

During the year ended December 31, 2010, USLF repaid
    $354.8 million of outstanding mortgage loan payables and
    $2.5 million on two outstanding mortgage loans payable in
    conjunction with the disposition of real estate. The loans bore
    an interest rate of 5.52 percent and 5.14 percent,
    respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, USLF repaid
    $28.7 million of outstanding mortgage loan payable and
    $9.9 million of outstanding mortgage loans payable in
    conjunction with the disposition of real estate. The loans bore
    a weighted average interest of 4.64 percent. In addition,
    USLF used the sales proceeds from the dispositions to reduce
    $2.6 million of near-term mortgage loan maturities.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, USLF had a secured credit
    facility providing for loans in an initial principal amount
    outstanding of up to $65.0 million. The credit facility is
    secured by a pledge of the equity in AMB Mosaic Properties, LLC,
    a Special Purpose Entity (“SPE”) whose sole purpose is
    to own the AMB Mosaic properties. USLF is a guarantor of the
    obligations under the facility. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, USLF increased its borrowings on this
    facility by $38.9 million and decreased its borrowings on
    this facility by $77.8 million. The secured credit facility
    matures in September 2014 and $26.1 million bears interest
    at a rate of LIBOR plus 225 basis points (2.5 percent
    at December 31, 2010) and $38.9 million bears
    interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 225 basis points and cost
    of funds (3.4 percent at December 31, 2010). As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding balance on this
    secured credit facility was $26.1 million and
    $65.0 million, respectively. The credit facility contains
    customary and other affirmative covenants and negative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specific ratios. The management of USLF believes
    that it was in compliance with these financial covenants at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

As of December 31, 2010, USLF had outstanding mortgage
    loans payable totaling $1.6 billion, not including net
    unamortized mortgage discounts of approximately
    $4.6 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.66 percent and mature between 2011 and
    2024.

As of December 31, 2009, USLF had outstanding mortgage
    loans payable totaling $1.7 billion, not including net
    unamortized mortgage discounts of approximately
    $4.7 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.82 percent and mature between 2010 and
    2024.

The mortgage loans payable are collateralized by certain
    Properties and require monthly interest and principal payments
    until maturity. Certain of the mortgage loans payable are
    cross-collateralized. In addition, the mortgage

loans payable have various covenants. Management of USLF
    believes that USLF was in compliance with these covenants at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

As of December 31, 2010, certain USLF mortgage loans
    payable require the existence of SPEs, whose sole purposes are
    to own AMB Baltimore Beltway, AMB Palmetto, AMB Spruce Avenue,
    AMB Zuma Distribution Center, Boston Marine, JFK Logistics
    Center, LAX Gateway and SEA Logistics Center 2, properties that
    collateralize 11 mortgage loans payable. All SPEs are
    consolidated in USLF’s consolidated financial statements.
    The creditors of the SPEs do not have recourse to any other
    assets or revenues of USLF or to AMB or its affiliated entities.
    Conversely, the creditors of AMB and its affiliated entities do
    not have recourse to any of the assets or revenues of the SPEs.

INCOME
    TAXES

As a partnership, the allocated share of income of USLF is
    included in the income tax returns of the individual partners.
    Accordingly, no accounting for income taxes is required in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The Fund follows FASB issued guidance for accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes, which clarifies the accounting and
    disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions and seeks to reduce
    the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the
    recognition and measurement related to accounting for income
    taxes. Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact
    on the Fund.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, AMB receives
    acquisition fees equal to 0.9 percent of the acquisition
    cost of properties acquired. For the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, USLF paid AMB acquisition fees
    of approximately $1.6 million and $0, respectively. Prior
    to January 1, 2009, acquisition fees were capitalized and
    included in investments in real estate in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets. Pursuant to USLF’s adoption of
    policies related to accounting for business combinations,
    acquisition costs are now expensed and included in other
    expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations.

At certain of USLF’s properties, AMB is responsible for the
    property management. At each of USLF’s properties, AMB is
    responsible for the accounting. For properties for which AMB
    provides both property management and accounting services, AMB
    earns fees between 0.5 percent and 4.0 percent of the
    respective property’s cash receipts. For properties where
    the property management service is provided by a third-party,
    AMB earns accounting fees between 0.4 percent and
    1.0 percent of the respective property’s cash
    receipts. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and
    2009, AMB earned combined property management and accounting
    fees of approximately $6.4 million and $5.5 million,
    respectively.

At certain properties, AMB earns a leasing commission when it
    has acted as the listing broker or the procuring broker or both.
    For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, AMB earned
    leasing commissions of approximately $1.3 million and
    $1.2 million, respectively.

At certain properties, AMB earns construction management fees
    when it has acted as the project manager. AMB earned
    construction management fees of approximately $0.9 million
    and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

On a quarterly basis, AMB, as general partner, receives priority
    distributions of 7.5 percent of net operating income
    (excluding straight-line rents, straight-line ground rent
    expense, and amortization of lease intangibles) for providing
    asset management services to USLF. AMB earned approximately
    $13.6 million and $13.2 million in priority
    distributions for the years ended December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, USLF owed AMB $2.7 million and
    $0.5 million, respectively, in property management and
    accounting fees, operating cash flow distributions, priority
    distributions, and other miscellaneous items, which is included
    in accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets.

Commencing January 1, 2009, AMB, as general partner,
    offered CCSFERS an opportunity to have a portion of the priority
    distribution otherwise payable to AMB effectively returned to
    CCSFERS because CCSFERS has invested capital in excess of
    $50.0 million in USLF. Pursuant to its participation in
    this program and based on the amount of its invested capital in
    USLF, $0.7 million and $0.8 million of the priority
    distribution otherwise payable to AMB as general partner for the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, was
    payable to CCSFERS. Investors that have invested capital in
    excess of $50.0 million in AMB U.S. Logistics
    Fund Holdings, L.P. (“USLFH”), formerly known as
    AMB Fund III Holdings, L.P. (“Fund III
    Holdings”), or USLR (as opposed to USLF directly) are
    similarly eligible to participate in this program through the
    profit sharing program available to investors in USLFH.

For renovation properties, AMB earns a quarterly fee equal to
    0.70 percent per annum of the respective property’s
    acquisition cost (as defined). Such renovation fees are payable
    in arrears over the property’s initial renovation period
    (as defined). For the years ended December 31, 2010 and
    2009, AMB earned renovation fees of approximately
    $0.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Such
    renovation fees are capitalized and are included in investments
    in real estate in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Commencing June 30, 2008 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2010, a cumulative incentive distribution of $39.3 million
    has been earned by AMB.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    Fund, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance
    coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible
    under our third-party policies. The captive insurance Fund is
    one element of AMB’s overall risk management program. AMB
    capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with
    the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National
    Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections
    derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s properties.
    Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to perform an
    actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related
    deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated
    risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National
    Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third-party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include
    liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, and accrued
    but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
    business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to $3.8 million for both the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, USLF may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any,

S-22


AMB U.S.
    LOGISTICS FUND, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

that may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of USLF.

Environmental Matters.

USLF follows AMB’s
    policy of monitoring its properties for the presence of
    hazardous or toxic substances. USLF is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on USLF’s business,
    assets or results of operations. However, there can be no
    assurance that such a material environmental liability does not
    exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on USLF’s results of
    operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

USLF carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. USLF believes that the policy terms and
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and industry practice. In addition,
    certain of USLF’s properties are located in areas that are
    subject to earthquake activity; therefore, USLF has obtained
    limited earthquake insurance on those properties. There are,
    however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those
    due to acts of war that may be either uninsurable or not
    economically insurable. Although USLF has obtained coverage for
    certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and
    insured limits that USLF believes are commercially reasonable,
    it is not certain that USLF will be able to collect under such
    policies. Should an uninsured loss occur, USLF could lose its
    investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from, a
    property. AMB has adopted certain policies with respect to
    insurance coverage and proceeds as part of its operating
    policies, which apply to properties owned or managed by AMB,
    including properties owned by USLF.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, USLF
    evaluated subsequent events occurring through February 14,
    2011, the date these financial statements were issued, in
    accordance with USLF’s policy related to disclosures of
    subsequent events.

During January 2011, USLF completed an equity closing totaling
    $66.3 million from USLR & USLFH, which results in
    USLR (including AMB Property L.P.’s interest), CCSFERS, and
    AMB ownership interests in USLF of 56.2 percent,
    20.4 percent and 23.4 percent, respectively.
    AMB’s overall interest in USLF is 33.0 percent.

During January 2011, USLF repaid $100.7 million on
    outstanding mortgage loans payable and $26.1 million on a
    secured credit facility. The loans bore a weighted average
    interest rate of 6.6% and LIBOR plus 225 basis points
    (2.5 percent at December 31, 2010), respectively.

During January 2011, USLF acquired one building totaling
    278,365 square feet for approximately $17.3 million.

On January 30, 2011, AMB Property Corporation (“the
    Parent Company”) and AMB entered into an Agreement and Plan
    of Merger (the “merger agreement”) with ProLogis, a
    Maryland real estate investment trust, New Pumpkin Inc., a
    Maryland corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ProLogis,
    Upper Pumpkin LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
    wholly owned subsidiary of New Pumpkin, and Pumpkin LLC, a
    Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary
    of Upper Pumpkin. The merger agreement provides that:
    (1) Pumpkin LLC will be merged with and into ProLogis, with
    ProLogis continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly
    owned subsidiary of Upper Pumpkin; (2) thereafter, New
    Pumpkin will be merged with and into the Parent Company (the
    “merger”), with the Parent Company continuing as the
    surviving corporation with its corporate name changed to
    “ProLogis Inc.”; and (3) thereafter, the
    surviving corporation will contribute all of the outstanding
    equity interests of Upper Pumpkin to AMB in exchange for the
    issuance by AMB of partnership interests to the surviving

    directors) of the surviving corporation, and (ii) unless
    earlier terminated, the employment of Mr. Sullivan as the
    chief financial officer of the surviving corporation will
    terminate and Mr. Thomas S. Olinger, the current chief
    financial officer of the Parent Company, will become the chief
    financial officer of the surviving corporation.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Partners of

AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of
    partners’ capital and noncontrolling interests and of cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and its
    subsidiaries (collectively, the “Partnership”) at
    December 31, 2008, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
    the Partnership’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
    audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
    the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements, the
    Partnership adopted accounting standards related to
    noncontrolling interests effective January 1, 2009. All
    amounts have been reclassified herein to conform to 2009
    presentation.

DECEMBER 31, 2008

1.

ORGANIZATION

On September 17, 2003, AMB Property, L.P. (“AMB”)
    formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, LLC
    (“Alliance Fund III, LLC”), a Delaware limited
    liability Fund. On October 25, 2004, AMB converted Alliance
    Fund III, LLC into a limited partnership, AMB
    U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. (“USLF”), a Delaware
    limited partnership, formerly known as AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P. (“Fund III”), and
    admitted AMB U.S. Logistics REIT, Inc. (“USLR”),
    formerly known as AMB Institutional Alliance REIT III, Inc.
    (“REIT III”) into USLF as a limited partner. Due to
    the related party nature of the conversion, and that USLF was
    under common control with Alliance Fund III, LLC, the
    assets and liabilities were accounted for by USLF at historical
    cost.

On October 26, 2004 (“Inception”), USLF completed
    its first closing and accepted capital contributions from AMB
    Property, L.P. and USLR. On November 1, 2006, AMB Property
    II, L.P. (collectively with AMB Property, L.P., “AMB”)
    was admitted to USLF as a limited partner in exchange for a
    contribution of 16 industrial buildings with an estimated value
    of $111.9 million. On July 1, 2008, the City and
    County of San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System
    (“CCSFERS”) and AMB contributed their partnership
    interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. (“Partners II”) to
    USLF in exchange for partnership interests in USLF. As of
    December 31, 2008, USLF has accepted capital contributions
    from AMB, CCSFERS and USLR (excluding AMB Property, L.P.’s
    interest), and contributions resulting from USLF’s dividend
    reinvestment program, for ownership interests in USLF of
    19.4 percent, 25.5 percent and 55.1 percent,
    respectively. AMB is a general and limited partner of USLF. As
    of December 31, 2008, all capital balances reflect balances
    at liquidation value.

As of December 31, 2008, $56.6 million of USLR units
    in USLF have been redeemed.

Effective January 25, 2010 Fund III, REIT III and AMB
    Fund III Holdings, L.P. changed their legal names. These
    legal name changes do not involve a change of control or other
    change in the ownership percentages of these entities. All other
    USLF related and subsidiary entities remain as is. Legal name
    changes are as follows:

Former Names:

Effective Names:

AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

AMB Institutional Alliance REIT III, Inc.

AMB U.S. Logistics REIT, Inc. (“USLR”)

AMB Fund III Holdings, L.P.

AMB U.S. Logistics Fund Holdings, L.P. (“USLFH”)

As of December 31, 2008, USLF owned 128 operating
    properties and one renovation property (consisting of 310
    industrial buildings aggregating 37.0 million square feet
    (unaudited)) and one parcel of land held for future development
    (the “Properties”). The Properties are located in the
    following markets: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore/Washington DC,
    Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, Northern New
    Jersey/New York, Orlando, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle,
    South Florida, and Southern California.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of USLF and the ventures in which
    USLF has a controlling interest. Third party equity interests in
    USLF’s ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests
    in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All
    significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying

S-31


AMB U.S.
    LOGISTICS FUND, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of USLF’s long-lived assets could occur in the future
    period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a
    property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the
    property over its estimated fair value is charged to income and
    is included on the consolidated statement of operations. As a
    result of the economic environment, the management of USLF
    re-evaluated the carrying value of its investments and recorded
    impairment charges of $8.9 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local airport
    authorities, and subject to ground leases are depreciated over
    the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the
    underlying ground lease. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building costs on ground leases

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in property including
    legal fees and acquisition costs. Project costs associated with
    the development and construction of a real estate project, which
    include interest and property taxes, are capitalized as
    construction in progress. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, USLF capitalized interest and property taxes of
    approximately $0.3 million.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

USLF records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for
    the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2008, USLF has recorded intangible assets or
    liabilities in the amounts of $12.6 million,
    $42.1 million, $37.8 million, and $73.6 million
    for the value attributable to above-market leases, below-market
    leases, in-place leases, and lease origination costs,
    respectively, which are included in buildings and improvements
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

USLF also records at acquisition an asset or liability for the
    value attributable to above- or below-market assumed mortgage
    loans payable. As of December 31, 2008, USLF has recorded
    $0.9 million for net above-market assumed mortgage loans
    payable.

Discontinued Operations.

USLF reports its
    property sales as discontinued operations separately as
    prescribed under its policy of accounting for the disposal of
    long-lived assets, which requires USLF to separately report as
    discontinued operations the historical operating results
    attributable to properties held for divestiture or operating
    properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the
    disposition of the properties. Although this application may
    affect the presentation of USLF’s consolidated results of
    operations for the periods that it has already reported, there
    will be no effect on its previously reported consolidated
    financial position, net income or cash flows. These financial
    statements have been updated for discontinued operations through
    December 31, 2009. Discontinued operations
    for properties sold or held for sale in 2010 are not
    material.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with reserves from loan proceeds
    for certain capital improvements and real estate tax payments.
    Restricted cash also includes cash held by third parties as
    collateral for certain letters of credit. As of
    December 31, 2008, USLF had two letters of credit
    outstanding totaling $0.2 million. These letters of credit
    are for security deposits on ground leases.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related mortgage loans payable. As of
    December 31, 2008, deferred financing costs were
    $9.2 million, net of accumulated amortization.

Mortgage Premiums and Discounts.

Mortgage
    premiums and discounts represent the difference between the fair
    value of debt and the principal value of debt assumed in
    connection with acquisitions. The mortgage premiums and
    discounts are being amortized into interest expense over the
    term of the related debt instrument using the effective-interest
    method. As of December 31, 2008, the net unamortized
    mortgage discounts were approximately $4.4 million.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent interests held by an affiliate of AMB and
    third-party investors in various USLF entities. Such investments
    are consolidated because USLF owns a majority interest and
    exercises control through the ability to control major operating
    decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    USLF are allocated to each of the partners in accordance with
    the partnership agreement. Partner distributions are made
    quarterly. Distributions, other than priority distributions
    (Note 8), are paid or accrued to each of the partners in
    accordance with their respective partnership units owned at the
    time distributions are declared.

On January 1, 2005, USLF issued 125 Series A preferred
    units at a price of $1,000 per unit, which are held by USLR.
    USLR in turn issued 125 shares of Series A preferred
    stock at a price of $1,000 per share. The Series A
    preferred stock is 12.5 percent cumulative non-voting
    preferred stock, callable with a premium based on the period of
    time the stock has been outstanding. The call premium was
    15.0 percent through December 31, 2007. The premium
    will reduce each year thereafter by 5.0 percent per year
    such that there will be no premium after December 31, 2009.
    Dividends are payable on June 30 and December 31 of each year.

Rental Revenues.

USLF, as a lessor, retains
    substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of the
    Properties and accounts for its leases as operating leases.
    Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for real estate
    taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as
    revenue in the period that the applicable expenses are incurred.
    In addition, USLF nets its bad debt expense against rental
    income for financial reporting purposes. Such amounts totaled
    approximately $0.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. USLF recorded net $3.7 million of
    income related to amortization of lease

S-33


AMB U.S.
    LOGISTICS FUND, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2008. Of the
    net $3.7 million recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, $3.0 million relates to
    amortization expense of above-market leases and
    $6.7 million relates to amortization income of below-market
    leases, respectively. The lease intangibles are being amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with USLF in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on USLF’s ability to lease space and on the
    level of rent that can be achieved. As of December 31,
    2008, USLF did not have any material concentration of credit
    risk due to the diversification of its tenants.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

As of
    December 31, 2008, USLF’s consolidated financial
    instruments include mortgage loans payable, a secured credit
    facility and an unsecured credit facility. Based on borrowing
    rates available to USLF at December 31, 2008, the estimated
    fair value of the mortgage loans payable, secured credit
    facility and unsecured credit facility was $1.7 billion.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In December
    2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued a policy which changes the accounting
    for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer
    shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the
    recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for
    preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, the accounting for
    acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment
    of acquisition-related transaction costs and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. USLF is in
    the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of this
    policy will have on its financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows, but, at a minimum, it will require
    the expensing of transaction costs.

In December 2007, the FASB issued a policy which clarifies that
    a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership
    interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as
    equity in the consolidated financial statements. This Statement
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008.

In March 2008, the FASB issued a policy which requires entities
    to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an
    entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and
    (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    affect an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance and cash flows. This policy is effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2008. USLF is in the process of evaluating the
    impact of the adoption of this policy.

3.

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2008, USLF acquired 141
    industrial buildings totaling 15,657,271 square feet
    (unaudited). The total aggregate investment was approximately
    $1.4 billion, which includes approximately
    $6.4 million in closing costs and acquisition fees related
    to these acquisitions. The $1.3 billion total purchase
    price related to these acquisitions was allocated
    $480.8 million to land, $817.9 million to buildings
    and improvements, $9.1 million to in-place leases,
    $39.6 million to lease origination costs, $5.2 million
    to above-market lease assets, $4.0 million to below-market
    lease liabilities, and $0.5 million to a below-market
    assumed mortgage loan payable.

4.

DEBT

As of December 31, 2008, USLF had an unsecured revolving
    credit facility providing for loans in an initial principal
    amount outstanding of up to $110.0 million. USLF guarantees
    the obligations under the credit facility pursuant to the
    revolving credit agreement. USLF intends to use the facility to
    finance its real estate acquisition activity. The credit
    facility matures in December 2011 and bears interest at a rate
    of LIBOR plus 160 basis points (2.0 percent at
    December 31, 2008). In addition, there is an annual
    administration fee of $20,000 per year, payable quarterly in
    arrears. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance
    on this credit facility was $40.0 million. The credit
    facility contains customary and other affirmative covenants and
    negative covenants, including financial

S-34


AMB U.S.
    LOGISTICS FUND, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reporting requirements and maintenance of specific ratios. The
    management of USLF believes that it was in compliance with these
    financial covenants at December 31, 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, USLF obtained a
    secured credit facility providing for loans in an initial
    principal amount outstanding of up to $65.0 million. The
    credit facility is secured by a pledge of the equity in AMB
    Mosaic Properties, LLC. The secured credit facility matures in
    September 2015 and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus
    190 basis points (2.3 percent at December 31,
    2008). As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on
    this secured credit facility was $26.1 million. The credit
    facility contains customary and other affirmative covenants and
    negative covenants, including financial reporting requirements
    and maintenance of specific ratios. The management of USLF
    believes that it was in compliance with these financial
    covenants at December 31, 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, USLF obtained 16
    mortgage loans payable totaling $510.1 million. These loans
    bear interest at a weighted average rate of 5.94 percent
    and mature between 2010 and 2018.

In conjunction with the contribution of Partners II, USLF
    assumed 25 mortgage loans payable totaling $379.4 million.
    These loans bear interest at a weighted average rate of
    5.96 percent and mature between 2009 and 2024.

As of December 31, 2008, USLF had 74 mortgage loans payable
    totaling $1.8 billion, not including net unamortized
    mortgage discounts of approximately $4.4 million. These
    loans bear interest at a weighted average rate of
    5.55 percent and mature between 2009 and 2024.

The mortgage loans payable are collateralized by certain of the
    Properties and require monthly interest and principal payments
    until maturity. Certain of the mortgage loans payable are
    cross-collateralized. In addition, the mortgage loans payable
    have various covenants. Management of USLF believes that USLF
    was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, certain USLF mortgage loans
    payable require the existence of Special Purpose Entities
    (“SPEs”) whose sole purposes are to own AMB Baltimore
    Beltway, the AMB Mosaic properties, AMB Palmetto, AMB Spruce
    Avenue, AMB Zuma Distribution Center, Boston Marine, JFK
    Logistics Center, LAX Gateway and SEA Logistics Center 2,
    properties that collateralize 11 mortgage loans payable. All
    SPEs are consolidated in USLF’s consolidated financial
    statements. The creditors of the SPEs do not have recourse to
    any other assets or revenues of USLF or to AMB or its affiliated
    entities. Conversely, the creditors of AMB and its affiliated
    entities do not have recourse to any of the assets or revenues
    of the SPEs.

The scheduled principal payments of USLF’s mortgage loans
    payable, secured credit facility and unsecured credit facility
    as of December 31, 2008 were as follows:

INCOME

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, AMB receives
    acquisition fees equal to 0.9 percent of the acquisition
    cost of properties acquired. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, USLF paid AMB acquisition fees of

S-36


AMB U.S.
    LOGISTICS FUND, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximately $1.6 million. Acquisition fees are
    capitalized and included in investments in real estate in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

At certain properties, AMB is responsible for the property
    management or the accounting or both. On a monthly basis, AMB
    earns property management fees between 0.35 percent and
    3.50 percent of the respective property’s cash
    receipts. On a monthly basis, AMB earns accounting fees between
    0.15 percent and 1.20 percent of the respective
    property’s cash receipts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, AMB earned property management and
    accounting fees of approximately $3.1 million.

At certain properties, AMB earns a leasing commission when it
    has acted as the listing broker or the procuring broker or both.
    For the year ended December 31, 2008, AMB earned leasing
    commissions of approximately $0.2 million.

On a quarterly basis, AMB, as general partner, receives priority
    distributions of 7.5 percent of net operating income
    (excluding straight-line rents, straight-line ground rent
    expense, and amortization of lease intangibles) for providing
    asset management services to USLF. AMB earned approximately
    $12.2 million in priority distributions for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, AMB owed
    USLF $0.1 million in operating cash flow distributions,
    priority distributions, and other miscellaneous items, which is
    included in accounts receivable and other assets in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

For renovation properties, AMB earns a quarterly fee equal to
    0.70 percent per annum of the respective property’s
    acquisition cost (as defined). Such renovation fees are payable
    in arrears over the property’s initial renovation period
    (as defined). For the year ended December 31, 2008, AMB
    earned renovation fees of $12,000. Such renovation fees are
    capitalized and are included in investments in real estate in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Commencing June 30, 2008 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2008, an incentive distribution of $39.3 million has been
    earned by AMB.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include
    liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, accrued but
    unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to $2.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, USLF may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of USLF.

S-37


AMB U.S.
    LOGISTICS FUND, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Environmental Matters.

USLF follows AMB’s
    policy of monitoring its properties for the presence of
    hazardous or toxic substances. USLF is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on USLF’s business,
    assets or results of operations. However, there can be no
    assurance that such a material environmental liability does not
    exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on USLF’s results of
    operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

USLF carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. USLF believes that the policy terms and
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and industry practice. In addition,
    certain of USLF’s properties are located in areas that are
    subject to earthquake activity; therefore, USLF has obtained
    limited earthquake insurance on those properties. There are,
    however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those
    due to acts of war that may be either uninsurable or not
    economically insurable. Although USLF has obtained coverage for
    certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and
    insured limits that USLF believes are commercially reasonable,
    it is not certain that USLF will be able to collect under such
    policies. Should an uninsured loss occur, USLF could lose its
    investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from, a
    property. AMB has adopted certain policies with respect to
    insurance coverage and proceeds as part of its operating
    policies, which apply to properties owned or managed by AMB,
    including properties owned by USLF.

10.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

On February 4, 2009, two properties were added to AMB
    Mosaic Properties, LLC. A pledge of the equity in AMB Mosaic
    Properties, LLC secures a credit facility providing for loans in
    an initial principal amount outstanding of up to
    $65.0 million, which USLF obtained during the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

11.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Effective January 1, 2009, USLF adopted policies related to
    accounting for noncontrolling interests in consolidated
    financial statements, which clarified that a noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the
    consolidated entity that should be reported as capital in the
    consolidated financial statements. As a result of the adoption,
    USLF has retroactively renamed the minority interests as
    noncontrolling interests and has reclassified these balances to
    the capital section of the consolidated balance sheet. In
    addition, on the consolidated statements of operations, the
    presentation of net (loss) income retroactively includes the
    portion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

    Japan”) and AMB Property II, L.P. as limited partner,
    formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the “Fund”), a
    Cayman Islands-exempted limited partnership. On June 30,
    2005 (“Inception”), 13 institutional investors were
    admitted as limited partners to the Fund and AMB Property II,
    L.P. withdrew as a limited partner. The term of the Fund
    continues until June 2013, unless extended as provided for in
    the partnership agreement.

The limited partners collectively committed
    ¥ 49.5 billion in equity to the Fund and AMB
    Japan, as general partner, committed
    ¥ 0.5 billion in equity to the Fund. In addition,
    AMB Property Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“AMB Singapore”)
    committed ¥ 11.9 billion in equity to co-invest
    with the Fund in properties. As of December 31, 2010, the
    Fund completed eight capital calls totaling
    ¥ 49.5 billion and ¥ 0.5 billion
    from the limited partners and general partner, respectively, of
    which non-cash contributions from the general partner totaled
    ¥ 0.4 billion.

The Fund and AMB Singapore co-invest (80.81 percent and
    19.19 percent, respectively) in Singapore private limited
    companies (“PTEs”) which indirectly own industrial
    real estate in Japan. The properties are owned individually in
    Japanese Tokutei Mokuteki Kaishas (“TMKs”). TMKs are
    asset-backed entities subject to tax on income net of
    distributions. Distributions from TMKs to non-residents are
    subject to local withholding taxes.

As of December 31, 2010, the Fund indirectly owned
    80.81 percent of 27 operating buildings (the
    “Properties”) aggregating approximately
    7.3 million square feet (unaudited). The Properties are
    located in the Fukuoka market, the Chiba, Funabashi, Kashiwa,
    Kawasaki, Narita, Narashino, Ohta, Sagamihara and Saitama
    submarkets of Tokyo, and the Amagasaki submarket of Osaka.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America (“U.S. GAAP”) in Yen currency. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the
    Fund and the ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s
    ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements. All significant
    intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Functional and Reporting Currency.

The Yen is
    both the functional and reporting currency for the Fund’s
    operations. Functional currency is the currency of the primary
    economic environment in which the Fund operates. Monetary assets
    and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Yen are
    remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to
    the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its
    estimated fair value.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    investments in real estate. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

Prior to January 1, 2009, the initial cost of buildings and
    improvements included the purchase price of the property or
    interest in the property including legal fees and acquisition
    costs. Pursuant to the Fund’s adoption of policies related
    to accounting for business combinations, legal fees and
    acquisition costs are now expensed and included in general and
    administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

The Fund records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Fund has recorded
    ¥ 553.4 million, ¥ 1.7 billion,
    and ¥ 332.9 million for the value attributable to
    below-market leases, in-place leases, and lease origination
    costs, respectively, which are included in buildings and
    improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Real Estate Impairment Losses.

The Fund
    conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes
    in accordance with its policy of accounting for the impairment
    or disposal of long-lived assets, which indicates that asset
    values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may
    not be fully recoverable. The intended use of an asset, either
    held for sale or held for the long term, can significantly
    impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is intended to be
    held for the long term, the impairment analysis is based on a
    two-step test. If there has been a triggering event, which may
    include a decline in fair value below carrying value, then a
    test is performed to compare estimated future cash flows over
    the holding period, including a residual value (undiscounted and
    without interest charges), against the carrying value of the
    property. If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying
    value is measured against the estimated fair value from a market
    participant standpoint, with the excess of the asset’s
    carrying value over the estimated fair value recognized as an
    impairment charge to earnings. If an asset is intended to be
    sold, impairment is tested based on a one-step test, comparing
    the carrying value to the estimated fair value less costs to
    sell. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is
    inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current
    and future economic and market conditions and the availability
    of capital. The Fund determines the estimated fair values based
    on assumptions regarding rental rates, costs to complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values.
    During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Fund did not
    recognize any real estate impairment charges.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    reserves required to be held pursuant to agreements with Chuo
    Mitsui Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., Trust Bank of
    New York Mellon, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Shinsei
    Bank, Limited, and Mitsubishi UFJ Lease, Finance Company
    Limited, GE Real Estate Corporation Japan, PK Airfinance Japan
    Limited and Prudential Mortgage Asset Holdings I Japan
    Investment Business Limited Partnership. Pursuant to these
    agreements, minimum levels of cash are required to be held as
    reserves for operating expenses, real estate taxes and insurance
    reserves, security deposits, maintenance reserves and periodic
    withholding of collections for debt servicing.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related debt. As of December 31, 2010,
    deferred financing costs were ¥ 635.2 million,
    net of accumulated amortization.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities.

Based on
    the Fund’s policies of accounting for derivatives and
    hedging activities, the Fund records all derivatives on the
    balance sheet at fair value. All of the Fund’s derivatives
    are designated and qualified as a hedge of the exposure to
    variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of
    forecasted transactions, and are considered cash flow hedges.
    Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the
    timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument
    with the recognition of the earnings effect of the hedged
    forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.

Other Comprehensive Income.

The Fund reports
    other comprehensive income in its consolidated statements of
    partners’ capital and noncontrolling interests. Other
    comprehensive income was ¥ 264.5 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2010.

Mortgage and Bond Premiums.

Mortgage and bond
    premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt over the
    principal value of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions.
    The mortgage and bond premiums are being amortized into interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2010, the
    unamortized mortgage and bond premiums were approximately
    ¥ 0.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent a 19.19 percent indirect equity
    interest in the Properties held by AMB Singapore. Such
    investments are consolidated because the Fund owns a majority
    interest and exercises significant control through the ability
    to control major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Fund are allocated to each of the partners in accordance
    with the Fund’s partnership agreement. Partner
    distributions are expected to be made when distributable
    proceeds are available after taking into account the Fund’s
    cash needs. Distributions, other than priority distributions
    (Note 8), are made to each of the partners in accordance
    with their respective ownership interests at the time of the
    distribution.

Rental Revenues.

The Fund, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the respective leases. Reimbursements from
    tenants for real estate taxes and other recoverable operating
    expenses are recognized as revenue in the period that the
    applicable expenses are incurred. In addition, the Fund nets its
    bad debt expense against rental income for financial reporting
    purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Fund
    recorded bad debt expenses of ¥ 11.8 million. The
    Fund recorded ¥ 94.5 million of income related to
    the amortization of lease intangibles for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. The lease intangibles are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease
    terms.

Deferred tax assets and valuation
    allowance.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future
    income tax effects of temporary differences between the Fund
    financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
    using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the
    years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
    recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recognized, based
    on historical and projected financial information of the Fund
    along with any positive or negative evidence, when it is
    more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred
    tax asset will not be realized.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Fund in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Fund’s ability to lease space and on
    the level of rent that can be achieved. The Fund had five
    tenants that accounted for 44.5 percent of rental revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Fund’s financial instruments include mortgage loans
    payable, bonds payable and an unsecured loan payable. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Fund at December 31, 2010,
    the estimated fair value of the financial instruments was
    ¥ 75.0 billion.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued guidance related to accounting for fair value
    measurements which defines fair value and establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in order to meet disclosure
    requirements for fair value measurements. Fair value is defined
    as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
    paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or
    most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. This guidance also establishes a fair value
    hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels
    of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated
    balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the
    valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
    liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative
    contracts that are traded in an active exchange market.

Level 2.

Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities
    include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less
    frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative
    contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with
    inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation using
    unobservable inputs. This category generally includes long-term
    derivative contracts and real estate.

DEBT

As of December 31, 2010, the Fund had five mortgage loans
    payable totaling ¥ 23.7 billion. Of the
    ¥ 23.7 billion mortgage loans payable,
    ¥ 19.7 billion bears interest at a rate per annum
    equal to three-month Yen TIBOR or three-month Yen LIBOR plus a
    margin ranging from 150 to 200 basis points,
    ¥ 3.5 billion matures in August 2011,
    ¥ 7.8 billion matures in November 2011 and
    ¥ 8.4 billion matures in June 2013. To hedge the
    cash flows of these floating rate borrowings, the Fund purchased
    interest swaps and interest rate caps, which have fixed or
    capped the interest rates payable on principal amounts totaling
    ¥ 19.7 billion as of December 31, 2010 at
    rates ranging from 0.50 percent to 1.50 percent per
    annum, excluding margins. Including the interest rate swaps and
    interest rate caps, the effective borrowings cost for the
    ¥ 19.7 billion mortgage loans payable as of
    December 31, 2010 is 2.28 percent. Of the
    ¥ 19.7 billion mortgage loans payable,
    ¥ 3.5 billion is collateralized by a first
    priority security interest in certain TMK’s right, title
    and interest in one building, and severally but not jointly
    guaranteed by the Fund and AMB Singapore, the indirect owners of
    the TMK, ¥ 8.4 billion is collateralized by a
    first priority security interest in, and to all of certain
    TMKs’ right, title and interest in eleven buildings, and

    ¥ 7.8 billion is collateralized by a first
    priority security interest in certain TMK’s right, title
    and interest in one building. Of the remainder of the
    ¥ 23.7 billion, ¥ 4.0 billion
    bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.77 percent and matures
    in 2017.

As of December 31, 2010, the Fund had nine collateralized
    specified bonds payable, totaling ¥ 51.7 million.
    Of the ¥ 51.7 billion bonds payable as of
    December 31, 2010, ¥ 40.1 billion bears
    interest at rates per annum equal to the rates of three-month
    Yen TIBOR or three-month Yen LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85
    to 200 basis points and matures between 2011 and 2013. To
    hedge the cash flows of these floating rate borrowings, the Fund
    purchased interest swaps and interest rate caps, which have
    fixed or capped the interest rates payable on principal amounts
    totaling ¥ 36.2 billion as of December 31,
    2010, at rates ranging from 1.32 percent to
    1.60 percent per annum excluding the margin. Including the
    interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, the effective
    borrowing costs for the ¥ 40.1 billion bonds
    payable as of December 31, 2010, is 2.51 percent per
    annum. Of the remainder of the ¥ 51.7 billion
    bonds payable, ¥ 6.7 billion and
    ¥ 2.3 billion bear interest at fixed rates of
    2.54 percent and 4.30 percent, respectively, and
    mature in 2013, and ¥ 2.6 billion bears interest
    at a fixed rate of 2.77 percent and matures in 2017.

As of December 31, 2010, the Fund had an unsecured loan
    payable totaling ¥ 800.0 million. The outstanding
    unsecured loan payable bears interest at a rate per annum equal
    to three-month Yen LIBOR plus a margin of 275 basis points.
    The loan matures in January 2012. The weighted average interest
    rate for the unsecured loan payable as of December 31, 2010
    is 2.99 percent per annum.

DERIVATIVES
    AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Risk
    Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Fund is exposed to certain risk arising from both its
    business operations and economic conditions. The Fund
    principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business
    and operational risks through management of its core business
    activities. The Fund manages economic risks, including interest
    rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the
    amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of
    derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Fund enters
    into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that
    arise from business activities that result in the payment of
    future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are
    determined by interest rates. The Fund’s derivative
    financial instruments are used to manage differences in the
    amount, timing, and duration of the Fund’s known or
    expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments
    principally related to the Fund’s borrowings. The
    Fund’s derivative financial instruments in effect at
    December 31, 2010 were four interest rate swaps hedging
    cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on Yen TIBOR, two
    interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of variable rate
    borrowings based on Yen LIBOR, two interest rate caps hedging
    the cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on Yen LIBOR
    and two interest rate caps hedging the cash flows of variable
    rate borrowings based on Yen TIBOR.

Cash
    Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Fund’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives
    are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its
    exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this
    objective, the Fund primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps
    as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest
    rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of
    variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the
    Fund making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements
    without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest
    rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of
    variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise
    above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront
    premium.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
    derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is
    recorded in other comprehensive income and is subsequently
    reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged
    forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, such derivatives were used to hedge the
    variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate
    borrowings.

Credit-risk-related
    Contingent Features

In order to limit the financial risks associated with derivative
    applications, the Fund adheres to the Fund’s derivative
    policy to minimize counterparty risk. The derivative contracts
    are executed by the subsidiary of the Fund that is the borrower
    of the debt being hedged. With the exception of the two interest
    rate caps, the derivative counterparty is the same entity as, or
    an affiliate of, the lender of the applicable borrowings.
    Certain of the derivative contracts provide that if the
    borrower’s counterparty is downgraded below BBB- by
    S&P it can constitute an additional termination event.

Some of the Fund’s subsidiaries’ agreements with their
    derivative counterparties also include a provision that an
    occurrence of an Event of Default under the applicable borrowing
    being hedged would constitute an Event of Default under the
    applicable derivative contract. Some of the borrowing agreements
    of the Fund’s subsidiaries also

AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

contain a provision that a default under a derivative contract
    by the entity could, if it continues without waiver or cure,
    constitute an Event of Default under the borrowing agreements.

As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of derivatives in a
    liability position related to these agreements was
    ¥ 0.9 billion.

INCOME
    AND WITHHOLDING TAXES

The Fund is exempt from all forms of taxation in the Cayman
    Islands, including income, capital gains, and withholding tax.
    The foreign countries where the Fund has operations may impose
    income, withholding, and other direct and indirect taxes under
    their respective laws. Generally, the foreign countries impose a
    withholding tax rate on dividends or interest between countries
    based on various treaty rates. The Japanese Yugen Kaisha
    (“YK”) entities are also subject to a 40.69% statutory
    rate. Accordingly, the Fund recognizes income taxes for these
    jurisdictions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as necessary.
    As of December 31, 2010, the Fund has accrued a current tax
    liability of ¥ 200.0 million, representing future
    withholding taxes on distributions from operations and other
    local income taxes in Japan and Singapore. The Fund also has a
    deferred tax asset of ¥ 6.7 million as of
    December 31, 2010. The accrued tax liability and the
    deferred tax asset are included in accounts payable and other
    liabilities and accounts receivable and other assets,
    respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The tax consequences for each partner of the Fund of acquiring,
    holding, or disposing of partnership interests will depend upon
    the relevant laws of any jurisdiction to which the partner is
    subject.

The Fund follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes,
    which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in
    tax positions and seeks to reduce the diversity in practice
    associated with certain aspects of the recognition and
    measurement related to accounting for income taxes. Adoption of
    this guidance did not have a material impact on the Fund.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, AMB Japan receives
    incentive distributions equal to 20.0 percent of the amount
    over a 10.0 percent net nominal internal rate of return
    (“IRR”) accruing to the limited partners. The
    incentive distributions increase to 25.0 percent of the
    amount over a 13.0 percent IRR accruing to the limited
    partners. As of December 31, 2010 and for the year then
    ended, no incentive distribution has been paid or incurred.

AMB Property, L.P. (“AMB”), the indirect owner of AMB
    Japan, obtains company-wide insurance coverage from third
    parties that apply to all properties owned or managed by AMB,
    including the Properties. As such, the Properties are allocated
    a portion of the insurance expense incurred by AMB based on
    AMB’s assessment of the specific risks at those properties.
    For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Fund incurred
    insurance expense of approximately
    ¥ 225.5 million, which is included in real estate
    taxes and insurance in the accompanying consolidated statement
    of operations.

At certain properties, AMB Property Japan earns a market rate
    leasing commission when it has acted as the listing broker or
    the procuring broker or both. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, AMB Property Japan earned leasing
    commissions of approximately ¥ 181.5 million,
    which has been capitalized and included in investments in real
    estate in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

    managing their properties. For the year ended December 31,
    2010, AMB Property Japan earned property management fees of
    approximately ¥ 103.0 million.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset Management Agreements
    with certain TMKs, AMB Property Japan earns an accounting fee
    for maintaining the books and records with respect to their
    properties. For the year ended December 31, 2010, AMB Japan
    earned accounting fees of ¥ 5.6 million.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. Management of the Fund believes that the
    policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate
    and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk
    of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Fund’s properties are located in
    areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Fund has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although the Fund has
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that management of the Fund
    believes are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the
    Fund will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Fund.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Fund
    evaluated subsequent events occurring through February 15,
    2011, the date these financial statements were issued, in
    accordance with the Fund’s policy related to disclosures of
    subsequent events.

On January 30, 2011, AMB Property Corporation (“the
    Parent Company”) and AMB entered into an Agreement and Plan
    of Merger (the “merger agreement”) with ProLogis, a
    Maryland real estate investment trust, New Pumpkin Inc., a
    Maryland corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ProLogis,
    Upper Pumpkin LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
    wholly owned subsidiary of New Pumpkin, and Pumpkin LLC, a
    Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary
    of Upper Pumpkin. The merger agreement provides that:
    (1) Pumpkin LLC will be merged with and into ProLogis, with
    ProLogis continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly
    owned subsidiary of Upper Pumpkin; (2) thereafter, New
    Pumpkin will be merged with and into the Parent Company (the
    “merger”), with the Parent Company continuing as the
    surviving corporation with its corporate name changed to
    “ProLogis Inc.”; and (3) thereafter, the
    surviving corporation will contribute all of the outstanding
    equity interests of Upper Pumpkin to AMB in exchange for the
    issuance by AMB of partnership interests to the surviving
    corporation. As a result of the mergers, each outstanding common
    share of beneficial interest of ProLogis will be converted into
    the right to receive 0.4464 of a newly issued share of common
    stock of the Parent Company. The merger is subject to customary
    closing conditions, including receipt of approval of the Parent
    Company’s stockholders and ProLogis shareholders.

The merger agreement provides that, upon the consummation of the
    merger, the board of directors of the surviving corporation will
    consist of 11 members, as follows: (i) Mr. Hamid R.
    Moghadam, the current chief executive officer of the Parent
    Company, (ii) Mr. Walter C. Rakowich, the current
    chief executive officer of ProLogis, (iii) four individuals
    to be selected by the current members of the board of directors
    of the Parent Company, and (iv) five individuals to be
    selected by the current members of the board of trustees of
    ProLogis. In addition, upon the consummation of the merger,
    (a) Mr. Moghadam and Mr. Rakowich will become
    co-chief executive officers of the surviving corporation,
    (b) Mr. William E. Sullivan, the current chief
    financial officer of ProLogis, will become the chief financial
    officer of the surviving corporation, (c) Mr. Irving
    F. Lyons, III, a current member of the board of trustees of
    ProLogis, will become the lead independent director of the
    surviving corporation, (d) Mr. Moghadam will become
    the chairman of the board of directors of the surviving
    corporation and (e) Mr. Rakowich will become the
    chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors of
    the surviving corporation.

The merger agreement also provides that, on December 31,
    2012, (i) unless earlier terminated in accordance with the
    bylaws of the surviving corporation, the employment of
    Mr. Rakowich as co-chief executive officer will terminate
    and Mr. Rakowich will thereupon retire as co-chief
    executive officer and as a director of the surviving
    corporation, and Mr. Moghadam will become the sole chief
    executive officer (and will remain the chairman of the board of
    directors) of the surviving corporation, and (ii) unless
    earlier terminated, the employment of Mr. Sullivan as the
    chief financial officer of the surviving corporation will
    terminate and Mr. Thomas S. Olinger, the current chief
    financial officer of the Parent Company, will become the chief
    financial officer of the surviving corporation.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Partners of

AMB Japan Fund I, L.P.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of
    partners’ capital and noncontrolling interests and of cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the
    “Partnership”) and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (denominated in Yen). These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Partnership’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
    audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
    obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Partnership changed the manner in which it
    accounted for noncontrolling interests in 2009 and has
    retroactively reclassified the 2008 consolidated balance sheet
    and consolidated statement of operations to conform to the
    current year presentation.

ORGANIZATION

On May 19, 2005, AMB Japan Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Japan”) and AMB Property II, L.P. as limited partner,
    formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the “Fund”), a
    Cayman Islands-exempted limited partnership. On June 30,
    2005 (“Inception”), 13 institutional investors were
    admitted as limited partners to the Fund and AMB Property II,
    L.P. withdrew as a limited partner.

The limited partners collectively committed ¥
    49.5 billion in equity to the Fund and AMB Japan, as
    general partner, committed ¥ 0.5 billion in equity to
    the Fund. In addition, AMB Property Singapore Pte. Ltd.
    (“AMB Singapore”) committed ¥ 11.9 billion
    in equity to co-invest with the Fund in properties. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Fund completed eight capital calls
    totaling ¥ 49.5 billion and ¥ 0.5 billion
    from the limited partners and general partner, respectively, of
    which non-cash contributions from the general partner totaled
    ¥ 0.4 billion.

The Fund and AMB Singapore co-invest (80.81 percent and
    19.19 percent, respectively) in Singapore private limited
    companies (“PTEs”) which indirectly own industrial
    real estate in Japan. The properties are owned individually in
    Japanese Tokutei Mokuteki Kaishas (“TMKs”). TMKs are
    asset-backed entities subject to tax on income net of
    distributions. Distributions from TMKs to non-residents are
    subject to local withholding taxes.

As of December 31, 2009, the Fund indirectly owned
    80.81 percent of 27 operating buildings (the
    “Properties”) aggregating approximately
    7.3 million square feet (unaudited). The Properties are
    located in the Fukuoka market, the Chiba, Funabashi, Kashiwa,
    Kawasaki, Narita, Narashino, Ohta, Sagamihara and Saitama
    submarkets of Tokyo, and the Amagasaki submarket of Osaka.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America (“U.S. GAAP”) in Yen currency. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the
    Fund and the ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s
    ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements. All significant
    intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Functional and Reporting Currency.

The Yen is
    both the functional and reporting currency for the Fund’s
    operations. Functional currency is the currency of the primary
    economic environment in which the Fund operates. Monetary assets
    and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Yen are
    remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to
    the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its
    estimated fair value.

S-61


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    investments in real estate. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

Prior to January 1, 2009, the initial cost of buildings and
    improvements included the purchase price of the property or
    interest in the property including legal fees and acquisition
    costs. Pursuant to the Fund’s adoption of policies related
    to accounting for business combinations, legal fees and
    acquisition costs are now expensed and included in general and
    administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

The Fund records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Fund has recorded
    ¥ 553.4 million, ¥ 1.7 billion, and
    ¥ 332.9 million for the value attributable to
    below-market leases, in-place leases, and lease origination
    costs, respectively, which are included in buildings and
    improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Fund had recorded intangible
    assets and liabilities in the amounts of ¥
    553.4 million, ¥ 1.5 billion, and ¥
    235.0 million for the value attributable to below-market
    leases, in-place leases, and lease origination costs,
    respectively, which are included in buildings and improvements
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Real Estate Impairment Losses.

Carrying values
    for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on
    a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    When the carrying value of a property is greater than its
    estimated fair value, based on the intended use and holding
    period, an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the
    excess over its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The
    intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the
    long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured.
    If an asset is intended to be held for the long term, the
    impairment analysis is based on a two-step test. The first test
    measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding
    period, including a residual value (undiscounted and without
    interest charges), against the carrying value of the property.
    If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is
    measured against the lower of cost (net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization) or the present value of expected
    cash flows over the expected hold period. An impairment charge
    to earnings is recognized for the excess of the asset’s
    carrying value over the lower of cost (net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization) or the present value of expected
    cash flows over the expected hold period. If an asset is
    intended to be sold, impairment is determined using the
    estimated fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of
    expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and
    relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and
    market conditions and the availability of capital. The
    management of the Fund determines estimated fair values based on
    its assumptions regarding rental rates,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices. The management of the
    Fund believes that there were no impairments of the carrying
    values of its investments in real estate as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    reserves required to be held pursuant to agreements with Chuo
    Mitsui Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., JP Morgan
    Trust Bank, Ltd. (“JP Morgan”), Sumitomo Mitsui
    Banking Corporation, Shinsei Bank, Limited, and Mitsubishi UFJ
    Lease, Finance Company Limited, GE Real Estate

AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Corporation Japan and PK Airfinance Japan Limited, as well as
    cash held in escrow under the terms of the loan agreement with
    JP Morgan. Pursuant to these agreements, minimum levels of cash
    are required to be held as reserves for operating expenses, real
    estate taxes and insurance reserves, security deposits,
    maintenance reserves and periodic withholding of collections for
    debt servicing.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related debt. As of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, deferred financing costs were ¥ 689.5 million
    and ¥ 798.9 million, respectively, net of accumulated
    amortization.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities.

Based on
    the Fund’s policies of accounting for derivatives and
    hedging activities, the Fund records all derivatives on the
    balance sheet at fair value. All of the Fund’s derivatives
    are designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to
    variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of
    forecasted transactions, and are considered cash flow hedges.
    Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the
    timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument
    with the recognition of the earnings effect of the hedged
    forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The Fund
    reports other comprehensive income (loss) in its consolidated
    statements of partners’ capital and noncontrolling
    interests. Other comprehensive loss was ¥ 66.3 million
    and ¥ 580.3 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Mortgage and Bond Premiums.

Mortgage and bond
    premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt over the
    principal value of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions.
    The mortgage and bond premiums are being amortized into interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the unamortized mortgage and bond premiums were
    approximately ¥ 16.9 million and ¥
    30.4 million, respectively.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent a 19.19 percent indirect equity
    interest in the Properties held by AMB Singapore. Such
    investments are consolidated because the Fund owns a majority
    interest and exercises significant control through the ability
    to control major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Fund are allocated to each of the partners in accordance
    with the Fund’s partnership agreement. Partner
    distributions are expected to be made when distributable
    proceeds are available after taking into account the Fund’s
    cash needs. Distributions, other than priority distributions
    (Note 9), are made to each of the partners in accordance
    with their respective ownership interests at the time of the
    distribution.

Rental Revenues.

The Fund, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. In addition, the Fund nets its bad debt expense
    against rental income for financial reporting purposes. During
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund
    recorded bad debt expense of ¥ 249.0 million and
    ¥ 93.5 million, respectively. The ¥
    249.0 million consists of ¥ 220.0 million for
    base rent and utilities, ¥ 18.7 million for punitive
    rent, and ¥ 10.3 million for termination compensation
    and restoration. The Fund recorded ¥ 137.9 million and
    ¥ 163.0 million of revenue related to the amortization
    of lease intangibles for the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. The lease intangibles are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Deferred tax assets and valuation
    allowance.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future
    income tax effects of temporary differences between the Fund
    financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
    using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the
    years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
    recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recognized, based
    on historical and projected financial information of the Fund
    along with any positive or negative evidence, when it is
    more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred
    tax asset will not be realized.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Fund in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Fund’s ability to lease space and on
    the level of rent that can be achieved. The Fund had five
    tenants that accounted for 40.5 percent of rental revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Fund’s financial instruments include mortgage loans
    payable, bonds payable and an unsecured loan payable. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Fund at December 31, 2009,
    the estimated fair value of the financial instruments was ¥
    75.0 billion.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Fund adopted policies related to
    accounting for business combinations, which changes the
    accounting for business combinations including the measurement
    of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business
    combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the
    accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
    accounting for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals,
    the treatment of acquisition-related transaction costs and the
    recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax
    valuation allowance. This adoption did not have a material
    effect on the Fund’s financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Fund adopted policies
    related to accounting for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as capital in
    the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
    adoption, the Fund has retroactively renamed the minority
    interests as noncontrolling interests and has reclassified these
    balances to the capital section of the consolidated balance
    sheets. In addition, on the consolidated statements of
    operations, the presentation of net income retroactively
    includes the portion of income attributable to noncontrolling
    interests.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Fund adopted policies
    related to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
    activities

,

which provides enhanced disclosures about
    (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments,
    (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for, and (c) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. This adoption did not have
    a material effect on the Fund’s financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance related to
    accounting for fair value measurements which define fair value
    and establish a framework for measuring fair value in order to
    meet disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Fair
    value is defined as the exchange price that would be received
    for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
    the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    on the measurement date. This guidance also establishes a fair
    value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels
    of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated
    balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the
    valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
    liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative
    contracts that are traded in an active exchange market.

Level 2.

Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities
    include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less
    frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative
    contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with
    inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This
    category generally includes certain corporate debt securities
    and derivative contracts.

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as

instruments for which the determination of fair value requires

During the year ended December 31, 2009, neither

    financial assets nor impairment charges were recorded following
    the review for impairment. This adoption had no material impact
    on the Fund’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Effective June 2009, the Fund adopted a policy related to
    disclosures of subsequent events which involves accounting for
    and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
    but before financial statements are issued or are available to
    be issued. This adoption did not have any impact on the
    Fund’s financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (Codification) which identifies the sources of
    accounting principles and the framework for selecting the
    principles used in the preparation of its financial statements
    that are presented in conformity with GAAP. Effective September
    2009, the Fund has adopted the Codification, which did not have
    a material impact on the Fund’s financial statements.

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Fund acquired
    an 80.81 percent equity interest in one entity that
    indirectly owned one operating property aggregating
    981,162 square feet (unaudited) from AMB Japan. AMB
    Singapore retained 19.19 percent of the equity interest in
    the same entity. The total aggregate investment cost was
    approximately ¥ 16.6 billion.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund acquired
    an 80.81 percent equity interest in two entities that
    indirectly owned two operating properties aggregating
    891,596 square feet (unaudited) from AMB Japan. AMB
    Singapore retained 19.19 percent of the equity interest in
    the same entities. The total aggregate investment cost was
    approximately ¥ 18.7 billion which includes
    approximately ¥ 23.3 million in closing costs related
    to these acquisitions. As of December 31, 2008, the Fund
    owed AMB Japan ¥ 163.0 million, which represents the
    unpaid portion of the purchase price related to the
    acquisitions, and is included in net payables to affiliates in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Fund paid this
    unpaid portion of purchase price to AMB Japan in 2009.

DEBT

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund had five and
    four mortgage loans payable totaling ¥ 24.5 billion
    and ¥ 16.7 billion, respectively. Of the ¥
    24.5 billion mortgage loans payable, ¥
    21.8 billion bears interest at a rate per annum equal to
    three-month Yen TIBOR or three-month Yen LIBOR plus a margin
    ranging from 130 to 200 basis points, ¥
    10.4 billion matures in September 2010, ¥
    3.6 billion matures in August 2011 and ¥
    7.8 billion matures in November 2011. To hedge the cash
    flows of these floating rate borrowings, the Fund purchased
    interest swaps and interest rate caps, which have fixed the
    interest rates payable on principal amounts totaling ¥
    21.8 billion as of December 31, 2009 at rates ranging
    from 1.05 percent to 1.50 percent per annum, excluding
    margins. Including the interest rate swaps and interest rate
    caps, the effective borrowings cost for the ¥
    21.8 billion mortgage loans payable as of December 31,
    2009 is 2.45 percent. Of the ¥ 21.8 billion
    mortgage loans payable, ¥ 14.0 billion is
    collateralized by a first priority security interest in, and to
    all of certain TMKs’ right, title and interest in and to
    twelve buildings, and severally but not jointly guaranteed by
    the Fund and AMB Singapore, the indirect owners of the TMKs. The
    remaining ¥ 7.8 billion is collateralized by a first
    priority security interest in certain TMK’s right, title
    and interest in one building.

Of the remainder of the ¥ 24.5 billion, ¥
    2.7 billion as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008, not
    including unamortized mortgage premiums of approximately ¥
    7.5 million and ¥ 13.5 million, respectively,
    bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures
    in 2011. The mortgage loan payable is collateralized by two
    buildings and requires interest only payments to be made
    quarterly until maturity in 2011. In addition, the mortgage loan
    payable has various covenants. Management of the Fund believes
    that the Fund was in compliance with these covenants at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund had one
    collateralized bond payable, totaling ¥ 3.2 billion
    and ¥ 3.3 billion, respectively, not including an
    unamortized bond premium of ¥ 9.4 million and ¥
    16.9 million, respectively. The bond bears interest at a
    fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures in 2011. Principal
    amortization on the bond started in June 2007.

If at any such time the principal outstanding on the ¥
    3.2 billion bond payable reaches the balance of the
    principal outstanding on the ¥ 2.7 billion mortgage
    loan payable, amortization of principal would then be applied on
    a pro rata basis of 50.0 percent to the bond payable and
    50.0 percent to the mortgage loan payable.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund had eight and
    seven collateralized specified bonds payable, respectively,
    totaling ¥ 49.7 billion and ¥ 50.3 billion,
    respectively. Of the ¥ 49.7 billion bonds payable,
    ¥ 40.6 billion bears interest at rates per annum

    LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to 200 basis points and

DERIVATIVES
    AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Risk
    Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Fund is exposed to certain risk arising from both its
    business operations and economic conditions. The Fund
    principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business
    and operational risks through management of its core business
    activities. The Fund manages economic risks, including interest
    rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the
    amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of
    derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Fund enters
    into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that
    arise from business activities that result in the payment of
    future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are
    determined by interest rates. The Fund’s derivative
    financial instruments are used to manage differences in the
    amount, timing, and duration of the Fund’s known or
    expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments
    principally related to the Fund’s borrowings. The
    Fund’s derivative financial instruments in effect at
    December 31, 2009 were six interest rate swaps hedging cash
    flows of variable rate borrowings based on Yen TIBOR, two
    interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of variable rate
    borrowings based on Yen LIBOR and two interest rate caps hedging
    the cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on Yen LIBOR.

Cash
    Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Fund’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives
    are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its
    exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this
    objective, the Fund primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps
    as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest
    rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of
    variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the
    Fund making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements
    without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest
    rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of
    variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise
    above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront
    premium.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
    derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is
    recorded in other comprehensive income and is subsequently
    reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged
    forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, such derivatives were used to hedge the
    variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate
    borrowings.

Amounts reported in other comprehensive loss related to
    derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest
    payments are made on the Fund’s variable-rate borrowings.

Credit-risk-related
    Contingent Features

In order to limit the financial risks associated with derivative
    applications, the Fund adheres to the Fund’s Derivative
    policy to minimize counterparty risk. The derivative contracts
    are executed by the subsidiary of the Fund that is the borrower
    of the debt being hedged. With the exception of the two interest
    rate caps, the derivative counterparty is the same entity as, or
    an affiliate of, the lender of the applicable borrowings.
    Certain of the derivative contracts provide that if the
    borrower’s counterparty is downgraded below BBB- by
    S&P it can constitute an additional termination event.

Some of the Fund’s subsidiaries’ agreements with their
    derivative counterparties also include a provision that an
    occurrence of an Event of Default under the applicable borrowing
    being hedged would constitute an Event of Default under the
    applicable derivative contract. Some of the borrowing agreements
    of the Fund’s subsidiaries also contain a provision that a
    default under a derivative contract by the entity could, if it
    continues without waiver or cure, constitute an Event of Default
    under the borrowing agreements.

INCOME
    AND WITHHOLDING TAXES

The Fund is exempt from all forms of taxation in the Cayman
    Islands, including income, capital gains, and withholding tax.
    The foreign countries where the Fund has operations may impose
    income, withholding, and other direct and indirect taxes under
    their respective laws. Generally, the foreign countries impose a
    withholding tax rate on dividends or interest between countries
    based on various treaty rates. The Japanese Yugen Kaisha
    (“YK”) entities are also subject to a 40.69% statutory
    rate. Accordingly, the Fund recognizes income taxes for these
    jurisdictions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as necessary.
    As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund has accrued a
    current tax liability of ¥ 209.8 million and ¥
    264.4 million, respectively, representing future
    withholding taxes on distributions from operations and other
    local income taxes in Japan and Singapore. The Fund also accrued
    a deferred tax asset of ¥ 27.7 million and ¥
    49.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The accrued tax liability and the deferred tax
    asset are included in accounts payable and other liabilities and
    accounts receivable and other assets, respectively, in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The tax consequences for each partner of the Fund of acquiring,
    holding, or disposing of partnership interests will depend upon
    the relevant laws of any jurisdiction to which the partner is
    subject.

Effectively January 1, 2008, the Fund adopted policies
    related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which
    clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
    positions, and such adoption did not have a material impact on
    the Fund.

    acquisition fees are capitalized and included in investments in
    real estate in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
    Pursuant to the Fund’s adoption of policies related to
    accounting for business combinations, acquisition costs are now

    loans) contributed to each PTE by the Fund and AMB Singapore.
    For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the PTEs
    recorded management service fees of approximately ¥
    76.2 million and ¥ 61.1 million, respectively,

    aggregate capital commitments made to the Fund from the
    effective date of the agreement through the Supplemental Capital
    Call Date (as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement).
    Pursuant to the Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated
    Limited Partnership Agreement of the Limited Partnership, for
    the period from July 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007,
    the asset management priority distribution base changed from
    100.0 percent to 90.0 percent of the aggregate capital
    commitments to the Fund; for the period from April 1, 2007
    through March 31, 2008, the asset management priority
    distribution base changed from 90.0 percent to
    80.0 percent of the aggregate capital commitments to the
    Fund; for the period from April 1, 2008 through the
    Supplementary Capital Call Date, the asset management priority
    distribution base changed from 80.0 percent to

    Fund until the Triggering Event Date (as defined in the Limited
    Partnership Agreement) which is the earlier of the date the
    unfunded capital commitments is less than 35.0 percent or
    the Supplemental Capital Call Date. Subsequently, AMB Japan
    receives asset management priority distribution equal to
    1.5 percent per annum, payable on a quarterly basis, of the
    unreturned capital contributions. The amounts referred to above
    are reduced by amounts paid or accrued to AMB Singapore for
    management service fees pursuant to the Management Services
    Agreement and asset management fees paid or accrued to AMB
    Property Japan, pursuant to the Agreement Regarding Asset
    Management Fees.

    capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent of the
    unreturned capital contributions. The recalculated asset
    management priority distribution was greater than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Second

    incentive distributions equal to 20.0 percent of the amount
    over a 10.0 percent net nominal internal rate of return
    (“IRR”) accruing to the limited partners. The

    such, the Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance
    expense incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund recorded insurance
    expense of approximately ¥ 239.0 million and ¥
    222.4 million, respectively.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. Management of the Fund believes that the
    policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate
    and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk
    of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Fund’s properties are located in
    areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Fund has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although the Fund has
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that management of the Fund
    believes are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the
    Fund will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Fund.
