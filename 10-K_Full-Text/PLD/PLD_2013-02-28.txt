EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 of Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to
“Prologis, Inc.” mean Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries; and references to “Prologis, L.P.” or the “Operating Partnership” mean Prologis, L.P., and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms “the
Company”, “Prologis”, “we,” “our” or “us” means Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership collectively.

Prologis, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (a “REIT”) and the general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2012, Prologis, Inc. owned an approximate
99.59% common general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and 100% of the preferred units in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximate 0.41% common limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated
investors and certain current and former directors and officers of Prologis, Inc. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Prologis, Inc. has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management
and control of the Operating Partnership.

We operate Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management of
Prologis, Inc. consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. These members are officers of Prologis, Inc. and employees of the Operating Partnership or one of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. As general partner
with control of the Operating Partnership, Prologis, Inc. consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and Prologis, Inc. does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore,
the assets and liabilities of Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.

We believe
combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits:

•

enhances investors’ understanding of Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the
same manner as management views and operates the business;

•

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the Company’s
disclosure applies to both Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership; and

•

creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

We believe it is important to understand the few differences between Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as an
interrelated consolidated company. Prologis, Inc.’s only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests in the Operating Partnership. As a result, Prologis, Inc. does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general
partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing public equity from time to time. Prologis, Inc. itself does not issue any indebtedness, but guarantees the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially
all the assets of the business, directly or indirectly, and holds the ownership interests in the Company’s investment in certain entities. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with
no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by Prologis, Inc., which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the
business through the Operating Partnership’s operations, its incurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of partnership units to third parties.

Noncontrolling interests, stockholders’ equity and partners’ capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of Prologis, Inc. and those of the Operating
Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership’s financial statements include the interests in consolidated entities not owned by the Operating Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in Prologis, Inc.’s financial
statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level, as well as the common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, which are accounted for as partners’ capital by the Operating
Partnership.

In order to highlight the differences between Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, there are separate sections in this
report, as applicable, that separately discuss Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership including separate financial statements, controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine
disclosure of Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of Prologis.





The statements in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the
industry and markets in which we operate, management’s beliefs and assumptions made by management. Such statements involve uncertainties that could significantly impact our financial results. Words such as “expects,”
“anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, which
generally are not historical in nature. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to rent and occupancy growth, development
activity and changes in sales or contribution volume of properties, disposition activity, general conditions in the geographic areas where we operate, our debt and financial position, our ability to form new co-investment ventures and the
availability of capital in existing or new co-investment ventures — are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to
predict. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained and therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ
materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may affect outcomes and results include, but are not limited to: (i) national, international, regional and local economic climates,
(ii) changes in financial markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, (iii) increased or unanticipated competition for our properties, (iv) risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions and development of
properties, (v) maintenance of REIT status and tax structuring, (vi) availability of financing and capital, the levels of debt that we maintain and our credit ratings, (vii) risks related to our investments in our co-investment
ventures, including our ability to establish new co-investment ventures, (viii) risks of doing business internationally, including currency risks, (ix) environmental uncertainties, including risks of natural disasters, and (x) those
additional factors discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements appearing in this report except as may be required by law.

PART I

ITEM 1. Business

The Company

We are the leading global owner, operator and
developer of industrial real estate, focused on global and regional markets across the Americas, Europe and Asia. As of December 31, 2012, on an owned and managed basis, we had properties and development projects totaling 554 million
square feet (51.5 million square meters) in 21 countries. These properties are leased to approximately 4,500 customers, including third-party logistics providers, manufacturers, retailers, transportation companies, and other enterprises.

Of the 554 million square feet of our owned and managed portfolio as of December 31, 2012:

•

522 million square feet were in our operating portfolio with a gross book value of $40.1 billion that were 94.0% occupied;

•

22 million square feet were in our development portfolio with a total expected investment of $2.1 billion that were 50.8% leased;

•

10 million square feet consisted of properties in which we have an ownership interest but do not manage and other properties we own, including
assets held for sale; and

•

the largest customer and 25 largest customers accounted for 2.0% and 18.7%, respectively, of the annualized base rent.

Prologis, Inc. commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997, elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (“Internal Revenue Code”), and believes the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. The Operating Partnership was also formed in 1997.

We have investments in entities through a variety of ventures. We co-invest in entities that own multiple properties with private capital investors and
provide asset and property management services to these entities. We refer to these entities as co-investment ventures. Our ownership interest in these entities generally ranges from 15-50%. These entities may be consolidated or unconsolidated,
depending on the structure, our partner’s participating and other rights and our level of control of the entity. The co-investment ventures may have one or more investors. We also have investments in joint ventures, generally with one partner
and that we do not manage. We refer to our investments in the entities accounted for on the equity method, both unconsolidated co-investment ventures and joint ventures, as unconsolidated entities.

Our global headquarters are located at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111 and our global operational headquarters are located at 4545 Airport
Way, Denver, Colorado 80239. Our other principal office locations are in Amsterdam, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Mexico City, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo.

Our Internet website address is www.prologis.com. All reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) are available or may be accessed free of charge through
the Investor Relations section of our Internet website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The common stock of Prologis, Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(“NYSE”) under the ticker “PLD” and is a component of the S&P 500.

Merger of AMB and ProLogis and Acquisition of
PEPR

On June 3, 2011, AMB Property Corporation (“AMB”) completed a merger with ProLogis, a Maryland REIT
(“ProLogis”) in which ProLogis shareholders received 0.4464 of a share of common stock of AMB for each outstanding common share of beneficial interest in ProLogis (the “Merger”). In the Merger, AMB was the legal acquirer and
ProLogis was the accounting acquirer. Following the Merger, AMB changed its



name to Prologis, Inc. In May 2011, we also acquired a controlling interest in and began consolidating ProLogis European Properties (“PEPR”) (the “PEPR Acquisition”). Our
results for 2011 reflect approximately seven months of the impact of the Merger and the PEPR Acquisition. Therefore, period to period comparisons may not be meaningful. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more
information relating to both the Merger and PEPR Acquisition.

Investment Strategy

We believe that gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth and growth in global trade are important drivers of demand for our product. Trade and GDP
are correlated as higher levels of investment, production and consumption within a globalized economy are consistent with increased levels of imports and exports. As the world produces and consumes more, we believe that the volume of global trade
will continue to increase at a rate in excess of growth in global GDP. Significant supply chain reconfiguration, obsolescence and customers’ preference to lease, rather than own, facilities also drive demand for quality distribution space.

Our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and
depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain to support global trade. We have a deep global presence with assets under management of $43.1 billion spanning 21 countries on four continents. Our properties are primarily
located in two main market categories, global markets and regional markets. Global markets comprise approximately 30 of the largest markets tied to global trade. These markets feature large population centers with high per-capita consumption rates
and are located near major airports, seaports and ground transportation systems. Similar to global markets, regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain and are often less supply
constrained. We intend to primarily hold only the highest quality class-A product in global and regional markets. As of December 31, 2012, global and regional markets represented approximately 83% and 12%, respectively of our overall owned and
managed platform (based on our share of net operating income of the properties). We also own a small number of assets in other markets, which account for approximately 5% of our owned and managed platform, and from which we generally plan to exit
from in an orderly fashion in the next few years, although we may continue to opportunistically invest in other markets. Our portfolio allows us to have local market knowledge, construction expertise and a commitment to sustainable design. We are
supported by a broad and diverse customer base, comprising relationships with multinational corporations that result in repeatable business.

Business Strategy

Our business strategy includes two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Private Capital. We generate revenue, earnings, net operating income (calculated as rental income less rental expenses),
funds from operations (or FFO as defined in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) and cash flows through our segments primarily through three lines of business, as
follows:

Real Estate Operations Segment

Rental Operations

- This represents the primary source of our core revenue, earnings and FFO. We collect rent from our customers under operating leases, including reimbursements for the vast
majority of our operating costs. We seek to generate long-term internal growth in rental income by maintaining a high occupancy rate at our properties, by controlling expenses and through contractual rent increases on existing space and renewals on
rollover space, thus capitalizing on the economies of scale inherent in owning, operating and growing a large global portfolio. Our rental income is diversified due to both our global presence and our broad customer base. We expect to generate
long-term internal growth in rents by increasing our occupancy rate and through rent increases on existing space and renewals on rollovers. We believe that our property management and leasing teams, regular maintenance programs, capital expenditure
programs, energy management and sustainability programs create cost efficiencies, allowing us to leverage our global platform and provide flexible solutions for our customers as well as for us.

Capital Deployment Activities -

Our development and re-development activities support our rental operations and are therefore
included with that line of business for segment reporting. We develop and re-develop industrial properties primarily in global and regional markets to meet our customers’ needs. Within this line of business, we provide additional value creation
by utilizing: (i) the land that we currently own in global and regional markets; (ii) the development expertise of our local personnel; (iii) our global customer relationships; and (iv) the demand for high quality distribution
facilities in key markets. We seek to increase our rental income and the net asset value of the Company through the leasing of newly developed space, as well as through the acquisition of new properties. Depending on several factors, we may develop
properties directly or in co-investment ventures for long-term hold, for contribution into one of our co-investment ventures, or for sale to third parties. Properties that we choose to contribute or sell may result in the recognition of gains or
losses. Generally, in the United States, Europe and Japan we are developing directly while in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and Mexico we are developing with our private capital partners in a variety of co-investment ventures.

Private Capital Segment

-

We co-invest in properties with private capital investors through a variety of co-investment ventures. We have a
direct and long-standing relationship with a significant number of institutional investors. We tailor industrial portfolios to investors’ specific needs and deploy capital in both close-ended and open-ended venture structures and other joint
ventures, while providing complete portfolio management and financial reporting services. We generally own 15-50% in these ventures. We believe our co-investment in each of our ventures provides a strong alignment of interests with our co-investment
partners’ interests. We generate revenues from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures by providing asset management and property management services. We may also earn revenues through additional services provided such as leasing,
acquisition, construction, development, disposition, legal and tax services. Depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners, we may also earn revenues through incentive returns or promotes. We believe our
co-investment program with private capital investors will continue to serve as a source of capital for new investments and provide revenues for



our stockholders, as well as mitigate risk associated with our foreign currency exposure. We expect to grow this business with the formation of new ventures, such as the two ventures discussed
below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and by raising additional third-party capital in our existing ventures.

Our Operating Segments

As discussed above, our current business strategy includes two operating segments: Real Estate Operations, which includes our Capital Deployment activities, and Private Capital. Please see
“Item 1A Risk Factors”, our property information and market presence as presented in “Item 2. Properties”, a discussion of our segment results in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and our segment footnote – Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information with regard to the investments and results of operations of our segments.

Competition

The existence of
competitively priced distribution space available in any market could have a material impact on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can charge, which impacts both of our operating segments. To the extent we wish to acquire land for
future development of properties in our Real Estate Operations segment or dispose of land, we may compete with local, regional, and national developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our Private
Capital segment.

We believe we have competitive advantages due to (i) our ability to respond quickly to customers’ needs for
high-quality distribution space in key global distribution markets; (ii) our established relationships with key customers served by our local personnel; (iii) our ability to leverage our organizational structure to provide a single point
of contact for our global customers through our Global Customer Solutions team; (iv) our property management and leasing expertise; (v) our relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in our private capital
business; (vi) our global experience in the development and management of industrial properties; (vii) the strategic locations of our land that we expect to develop; and (viii) our personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement
process.

Customers

We have
developed a customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international, national, regional and local distribution space users. At December 31, 2012, in our Real Estate Operations segment,
we had 3,832 customers occupying 296.5 million square feet of distribution space. In the unconsolidated properties we manage, we had 2,703 customers occupying 195.9 million square feet of distribution space. In our Real Estate Operations
segment, our largest customer and 25 largest customers accounted for 1.6% and 18.7%, respectively, of our annualized base rent at December 31, 2012.

Within our Global Customer Solutions team, we develop long-term relationships with our customers and understand their business and needs, serving as their strategic partner for real estate on a global
basis. Keeping in close contact with customers and focusing on exceptional customer service sets us apart from other real estate providers as much more than a landlord. We believe that what we offer in terms of scope, scale and quality of assets is
unique. Our in-depth knowledge of our markets helps us stay ahead of trends and create forward-thinking solutions for their distribution networks. This depth of customer knowledge results in greater retention and expanded service, which garners
additional business from the same customer across multiple geographies. In our Real Estate Operations segment, approximately 50.0% of our annual base rent is derived from customers who lease from us in more than one location and more than one
country.

In our Private Capital segment, we consider our private capital investors to be our customers. As of December 31, 2012, we
partnered with 107 investors, several of which invest in multiple ventures.

Employees

We employ 1,445 persons in our entire organization. Our employees work in four countries in the Americas (875 persons), in 15 countries in Europe (385
persons) and in three countries in Asia (185 persons). Of the total, we have assigned 885 employees to our Real Estate Operations segment and 100 employees to our Private Capital segment. We have 460 employees who work in corporate and support
positions who are not assigned to a segment who may assist with segment activities. We believe our relationships with our employees are good. Our employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, although some of our employees in
Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and benefit from applicable labor agreements.

Management’s Overview

At the time of the Merger, we established our key strategic priorities to guide our path through the end of 2013. These priorities were:

•

to align our portfolio with our investment strategy while serving the needs of our customers;

•

to strengthen our financial position and build one of the top balance sheets in the REIT industry;

•

to streamline our private capital business and position it for substantial growth;

•

to improve the utilization of our low yielding assets; and

•

to build the most effective and efficient organization in the REIT industry and to become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in
real estate as a career.



Align our Portfolio with our Investment Strategy

As discussed above, we have categorized our portfolio into three main segments – global, regional and other markets. By segmenting our markets in
this manner, we were able to construct a plan that includes culling the portfolio for buildings and potentially submarkets that are no longer a strategic fit. We expect to use the proceeds from dispositions to pay down debt that is secured by the
disposed assets, if any, repay other debt and to recycle capital into new development projects and/or strategic acquisitions.

Strengthen
our Financial Position

We intend to further strengthen our financial position by lowering our financial risk and currency exposure and
building one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry. We expect to lower our financial risk by reducing leverage and maintaining staggered debt maturities, which will increase our financial flexibility and provide for continued access
to capital markets. This financial flexibility will position us to capitalize on market opportunities across the entire business cycle as they arise. We expect to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations by borrowing in local
currency where appropriate, and utilizing derivative contracts to hedge our foreign denominated equity and swap U.S. dollar–denominated debt into obligations denominated in foreign currencies. We expect to also lower our foreign currency risk
by holding assets outside the United States primarily in co-investment ventures in which we maintain an ownership interest and provide services generating private capital revenue. We will accomplish this through contributions and sales to our
existing and newly formed co-investment ventures, including the new ventures in Europe and Japan discussed below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. In addition, we
expect that new development projects, particularly in those emerging markets such as Brazil, China and Mexico, will be done in conjunction with our private capital partners.

Streamline Private Capital Business

We are working with our private capital investors to
rationalize certain of our co-investment ventures. Some of our legacy co-investment ventures have fee structures that do not adequately compensate us for the services we provide. Therefore, we have terminated or restructured certain of these
co-investment ventures. In other cases, we may combine some co-investment ventures to gain operational efficiencies. In every case, however, we have and will continue to work very closely with our partners and venture investors who have been and
will be active participants in these decisions. We expect to continue with these activities during 2013. We plan to grow our private capital business with the deployment of the private capital commitments we have already raised, formation of new
co-investment ventures, including the new ventures in Europe and Japan, and raising incremental capital for our existing co-investment ventures.

Improve the Utilization of Our Low Yielding Assets

We plan to increase the value of our low yielding assets by stabilizing our operating portfolio to 95% leased, completing the build-out and lease-up of our development projects as well as monetizing our
land through development or sale to third parties.

Build the most effective and efficient organization in the REIT industry and become the
employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career

We realized more than $115 million of cost synergies on
an annualized basis, compared to the combined expenses of AMB and ProLogis on a pre-Merger basis. These synergies included gross general and administrative savings, reduced global line of credit facility fees and lower amortization of non real
estate assets. We will continue to look for and achieve additional savings opportunities. In addition, we implemented a new enterprise wide system that includes a property management/billing system (implemented in April 2012), a human resources
system (implemented in July 2012), a general ledger and accounting system and a data warehouse (implemented in January 2013). In connection with this implementation, we are striving to utilize the most effective global business processes with the
enhanced system functionality, and have also implemented several analytical tools to further empower and assist our regional and local teams. In early 2012, we implemented two new compensation plans that we believe will better align employees’
compensation to our company performance. We believe these efforts and others will help us with the attainment of this objective.

See
“Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our 2012 results and progress attaining the objectives outlined above.

Code of Ethics and Business Conduct

We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our Board of Directors (“Board”) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal
financial officer and the principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website, www.prologis.com. In addition to being accessible through our website,
copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, or the principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will
be disclosed on our website.

Environmental Matters

We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we subjected a majority of the
properties we have acquired, including land, to environmental reviews. While



some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.

Insurance Coverage

We carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties
and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood, earthquake
and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self insurance and through a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. We believe that our
insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. However, an uninsured loss could result in loss of
capital investment and anticipated revenues and earnings. See further discussion in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, distributable cash flow and value of our securities. These risks include, among others:

General

Disruptions in the Global Capital and Credit Markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Global market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth in most major economies
during the last few years. Although signs of recovery are emerging, there are continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, the availability and cost of credit, a lagging real estate market and geopolitical issues that contribute to
increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy. To the extent there is turmoil in the financial markets, it has the potential to materially affect the value of our properties and investments in our unconsolidated
entities, the availability or the terms of financing that we and our unconsolidated entities have or may anticipate utilizing, our ability and that of our unconsolidated entities to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance any
outstanding debt when due and may impact the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases.

The market volatility over the last several years has made the valuation of our properties and those of our unconsolidated entities more difficult. There may be significant uncertainty in the valuation,
or in the stability of the value, of our properties and those we invest in through unconsolidated entities, that could result in a decrease in the value of our properties and our investments in unconsolidated entities. As a result, we may not be
able to recover the current carrying amount of our investments in real estate properties, including our unconsolidated entities, which may require us to recognize an impairment charge in earnings where it is known in addition to the charges we
previously recognized.

Any additional, continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities.

As a global company, we are subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in many countries.

We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States. During 2012, we generated approximately 41.8% or $838.6 million of our revenue from
operations outside the United States. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow include, but are not limited to, the
following factors:

•

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations in certain regions;

•

differing employment practices and labor issues;

•

local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices;

•

volatility in currencies;

•

currency restrictions, which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the United States;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and other laws;

•

potentially adverse tax consequences;

•

the responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, e.g., with respect to corrupt practices, employment and licensing;



•

the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;

•

political instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of
terrorist or gang activities (particularly with respect to our operations in Mexico);

•

foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries; and

•

access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations.

Our global growth also subjects us to certain risks, including risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and
establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and similar laws.

Although we have committed substantial resources to expand our global platform, if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our
global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.

In addition, our international operations and, specifically, the ability of our non-United States subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash
among our subsidiaries, including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt, may be affected by currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other things.

The depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our
results of operations and financial position.

We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, growth opportunities in international
markets where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency. At December 31, 2012, approximately 40.6% or $11.1 billion of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling,
euro and Japanese yen. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more
countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, debt covenant ratios, results of operations and cash flow. Although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt
agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts, there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful. Hedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties
may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency. The funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement
of foreign currency. The failure to hedge effectively against exchange rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.

Real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets, which may reduce economic returns to investors.

Real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition,
significant expenditures associated with real estate investments, such as secured mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments. Like other
companies qualifying as REITs under the Internal Revenue Code, we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable REIT subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of
such property. While we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment in order to generate liquidity, if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain
from the sale, we may not pursue such sales.

In the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations or
available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting ourselves of properties, whether or not they
otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term, at less than optimal terms, incurring debt, entering into leases with our customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing
customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover. There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us. Additionally, taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely
affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities.

Risks Related to our Business

General economic conditions and other events or
occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated, may impact financial results.

We are exposed to
general economic conditions, local, regional, national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties. Our operating performance is further impacted by the economic
conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties.



As of December 31, 2012, approximately 25.1% of our consolidated operating properties or $5.7 billion
(based on investment before depreciation) are located in California, which represented 20.5% of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 23.1% of our annualized base rent. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties
located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and
other factors may adversely impact California’s economic climate. Because of the number of properties we have located in California, a downturn in California’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities.

In addition to California, we also have significant holdings (defined as more than 3% of total investment before depreciation) in operating properties in certain global and regional markets located in
Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, France, Japan, Mexico, New Jersey/New York City, South Florida and the United Kingdom. Our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a
concentration of properties. Conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space, among other factors, may impact operating conditions. Any material oversupply of distribution space or material
reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations, distributable cash flow and the value of our securities.

In addition, the unconsolidated entities in which we invest have concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above, as well as in markets in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Seattle are
subject to the economic conditions in those markets.

A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to
earthquake activity. United States properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Seattle. International properties located in active seismic areas include Japan and Mexico. We generally
carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage
annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis. We have elected not to carry earthquake
insurance for wholly owned assets in Japan based on this analysis.

Further, a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to
be subject to hurricane and/or flood risk. We carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is
commercially reasonable. We evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants.

Our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses.

We and our
unconsolidated entities currently carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood,
earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance, as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and
insured limits customarily carried for similar properties, business activities and markets. We believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated entities are adequately insured. However, there are certain losses, including losses from
floods, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots, that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. If an uninsured loss or a loss
in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt
associated with the property.

Furthermore, we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with
sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us
in the event of an insured loss, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt
or other financial obligations related to the properties. Any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security
holders and the market price of our securities.

Investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect
our business.

Investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk. While we seek to minimize these risks
through geographic diversification of our portfolio, market research and our property management capabilities, these risks cannot be eliminated. Some of the factors that may affect real estate values include:

•

local conditions, such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space in an area;

•

the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers;

•

competition from other available properties;



•

increasing costs of rehabilitating, repositioning, renovating and making improvements to our properties;

•

our ability to provide adequate maintenance of, and insurance on, our properties;

•

our ability to control rents and variable operating costs;

•

governmental regulations, including zoning, usage and tax laws and changes in these laws; and

•

potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning and other laws.

Our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that
sector.

Our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector. This concentration may
expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified.

Our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers and we may be unable to
lease vacant space or renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire.

Our operating results and distributable cash
flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations. We are also subject to the risk that, upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties, leases may not be renewed
by existing customers, the space may not be re-leased to new customers or the terms of renewal or re-leasing (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers) may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Our
competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge
in order to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire. In the event of default by a significant number of customers, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord, and may be unable to
re-lease spaces. A customer may experience a downturn in its business, which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition, resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a
restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease. In addition, a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause
a reduction in our available cash flow.

If we decide to contribute or sell properties to an unconsolidated entity or third parties to
generate proceeds, we may not be successful.

We may contribute or sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated entities or third
parties on a case-by-case basis. Our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties; market conditions, including the capitalization rates
applicable to our properties; and other factors beyond our control. If our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets and/or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets, we may be unable to divest
our assets at favorable pricing or on favorable terms or at all. The unconsolidated entity or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital, in the private and public markets, in order to acquire
properties from us. Should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms, then dispositions could be delayed. If we are unable to generate proceeds through property sales we may have to delay our deleveraging plans, which may result
in adverse effects on our liquidity, distributable cash flow, debt covenant ratio, and the market price of our securities.

We may
acquire properties, which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities.

We may
acquire industrial properties. The acquisition of properties involves risks, including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements
identified in the pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates. When we acquire properties, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the
area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. Additionally, there is, and it is expected there will continue to be, significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with
obtaining financing for acquisition activities.

Our real estate development strategies may not be successful.

Our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through sales to third parties, development of industrial properties to
hold for long-term investment or contribution or sale to an unconsolidated entity, depending on market conditions, our liquidity needs and other factors. We may expand investment in our development, renovation and redevelopment business and we will
complete the build-out and leasing of our development platform. We may also develop, renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed development co-investment ventures. The real estate development, renovation and redevelopment
business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities, which include
the following risks:

•

we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all;

•

we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits
and authorizations;



•

we may seek to sell certain land parcels and not be able to find a third party to acquire such land or the sales price will not allow us to recover our
investment, resulting in additional impairment charges;

•

development opportunities that we explore may be abandoned and the related investment impaired;

•

the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts;

•

we may not be able to lease properties on favorable terms or at all;

•

construction costs, total investment amounts and our share of remaining funding may exceed our estimates and projects may not be completed, delivered
or stabilized as planned;

•

we may not be able to attract third party investment in new development co-investment ventures or sufficient customer demand for our product;

•

we may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced value created by our redevelopment projects on expected timetables or at all;

•

we may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if there is public or government opposition to our activities; and

•

substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of
management’s time and attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day operations.

We are exposed to
various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner, developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain
hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of
such hazardous substances. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental
contamination.

Environmental laws in some countries, including the United States, also require that owners or operators of buildings
containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed
during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury
associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties are known to contain asbestos-containing building materials.

In addition, some of
our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or
toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or
may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities
associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or
monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.

We cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not
arise in the future. The presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may have an adverse effect on our
distributable cash flow.

We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming co-investment ventures, investing in new or
existing co-investment ventures, attracting third party investment and investing in and managing properties through co-investment ventures.

As of December 31, 2012, we had an investment in real estate containing approximately 214.5 million square feet held through unconsolidated entities. Our organizational documents do not limit
the amount of available funds that we may invest in unconsolidated entities, and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through co-investment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances.
However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new co-investment ventures, attract third party investment or make additional investments in new or existing co-investment ventures, successfully develop or acquire properties through
unconsolidated entities, or realize value from such unconsolidated entities. Our inability to do so may have an adverse effect on our growth, our earnings and the market price of our securities.



Our partners in our unconsolidated investments may share certain approval rights over major decisions and
some partners may manage the properties in the unconsolidated entities. Our unconsolidated investments involve certain risks, including:

•

if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions, then we may choose to contribute such capital;

•

our partners might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our
ability to operate the property;

•

the venture or other governing agreements often restrict the transfer of an interest in the co-investment venture or may otherwise restrict our ability
to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms;

•

our relationships with our partners are generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in
such event, we may not continue to manage or invest in the assets underlying such relationships resulting in reduced fee revenue or causing a need to purchase such interest to continue ownership; and

•

disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors
from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable co-investment venture to additional risk.

We generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our unconsolidated entities to permit us to achieve our business objectives; however, we may not be able to do so. We have formed publicly traded
investment vehicles, like our publicly traded REIT in Japan, for which we serve as sponsor and/or manager. We have contributed, and may continue to contribute, assets into such vehicles. As with any of our publicly traded entities or
funds, there is a risk that we may not be able to continue to manage such entities and their assets in the event that our managerial relationship is terminated.

The occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security
holders and the market price of our securities.

Contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition.

We have acquired and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited
recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect
our cash flow. Contingent or unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

losses in excess of our insured coverage;

•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business;

•

tax, legal and regulatory liabilities; and

•

claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of our properties.

Risks Related to Financing and Capital

We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities, including refinancing and interest rate risks, and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely
affected if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt.

We are subject to risks normally
associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness, that such
refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness, or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness. If we are unable to
refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and, if the maturing debt is secured, the lender may foreclose on the property
securing such indebtedness. Our Global Senior Credit Agreement, Japanese yen-based credit agreement and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements. From
time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap or cap agreements. Such hedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. The funds required to settle
any swap breakage arrangements, if any, could be significant depending on the size of underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of breakage. The failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially
adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In addition, our unconsolidated entities may be unable to refinance indebtedness or meet payment obligations, which may impact our distributable cash flow and our financial condition
and/or we may be required to recognize impairment charges of our investments.



Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could
adversely affect our financial condition.

The terms of our various credit agreements, including our Global Senior Credit Agreement and
Japanese yen-based credit agreement, the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements, require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios,
fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the
applicable indebtedness. If we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default, refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition could be adversely
affected.

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity.

The credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall
financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade
in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital
market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth, our financial condition, the market price of our securities, and our development and acquisition activity.

We are dependent on external sources of capital

.

In order to qualify as a REIT, we
are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and we may be subject to tax to the extent our income
is not fully distributed. While historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property,
including, in limited circumstances, our own stock. For distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2012, and in some cases declared as late as December 31, 2013, the REIT can satisfy up to 90% of the
distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs,
including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on third-party sources of capital. Further, in order to maintain our REIT status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes, we may
need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing
between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access debt and
equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors, including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the
market price of our securities.

Our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock.

Any additional future issuance of common stock will reduce the percentage of our common stock owned by investors. In most circumstances, stockholders will
not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock. In addition, depending on the terms and pricing of an additional offering of our common stock and the value of the properties, our stockholders may experience dilution in
both book value and fair value of their common stock.

Federal Income Tax Risks

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences.

We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We believe we have operated so as to qualify as
a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, it is
possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on
an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, Prologis must derive at least 95% of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to our
stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. The provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations regarding qualification as a REIT are more complicated in our case because we hold assets through the Operating Partnership.



If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax
(including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year in which we lost the qualification. If we lost our REIT status, our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved.

Furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary REITs which elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. Provided that each subsidiary
REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interest in such subsidiary REIT will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT will generally be treated
as income that qualifies for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. To qualify as a REIT, the subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements. If such subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and
certain relief provisions did not apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to United States federal income tax. In addition, a failure of the subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT would have an
adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT.

Certain
property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction.

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including by contributing properties to our co-investment ventures.
Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty
tax. We do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that
depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Code may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are
prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Code would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue Code were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition, or contribution of property constituted a
prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for
qualification as a REIT.

Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us.

In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax taws applicable to investments in
REITs and similar entities. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future, and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders.

Other Risks

Risks Associated with our Dependence on Key Personnel.

We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may
change. In connection with the completion of the Merger, there were changes to our personnel and their roles. While we believe that we have retained our key talent and have found suitable employees to meet our personnel needs, the loss of key
personnel, any change in their roles, or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of
our securities. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our performance and competitive position could be materially
adversely affected.

Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result
in substantial costs.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements
related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available to make distributions and payments to our security holders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various
federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life-safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are
currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of
operations.

We are subject to governmental regulations and actions that affect operating results and financial condition.

Many laws, including tax laws, and governmental regulations apply to us, our unconsolidated entities and our properties. Changes in
these laws and governmental regulations, or their interpretation by agencies or the courts, could occur, which might affect our ability to conduct business.

Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.

The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors,
misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures



and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the
time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in the
price of our securities, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

We are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate change related risks.

We consider that we are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Our distribution facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms
and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase.

We do
not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change, as our operations do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. However, we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by
potential impacts to the supply chain and/or stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings.

ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

ITEM 2. Properties

We are invested in real estate properties that are primarily generic industrial properties. In Japan, our industrial properties are generally multi-level
centers, which is common in Japan due to the high cost and limited availability of land. Our properties are typically used for distribution, storage, packaging, assembly and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products. Based on the
square footage of the operating properties included in our Real Estate Operations segment at December 31, 2012 (and discussed below), all of our properties are industrial properties; consisting of 92.8% used for bulk distribution, 4.7% used for
light manufacturing and assembly, 1.0% used for flex industrial, 0.9% used for on-tarmac and 0.6% used for other purposes.

Geographic Distribution

Our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses
are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain. Our properties are primarily located in two main market types, global markets and regional markets. Global markets account for 84.7% of our
consolidated operating properties (based on investment balance) and comprise approximately 30 of the largest and most liquid markets tied to global trade. These markets feature large population centers with high per-capita consumption rates and
close proximity to airports, seaports and ground transportation systems. Regional markets account for 11.6% of our consolidated operating properties. Similar to global markets, regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are
not as tied to the global supply chain and are often less supply constrained.



The information in the following tables is as of December 31, 2012 for our consolidated operating
properties, properties in our development portfolio and land, including 157 buildings owned by entities we consolidate but of which we own less than 100%. All of these assets are included in our Real Estate Operations segment. This includes our
portfolio of operating properties we developed or are currently developing. No individual property or group of properties operating as a single business unit amounted to 10% or more of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2012 or
generated income equal to 10% or more of our consolidated gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012. These tables do not include properties that are owned by unconsolidated entities.



The following is a summary of our investment in consolidated real estate properties at December 31, 2012:

(1)

Represents the percentage occupied for our operating properties and the percentage leased for the properties in the development portfolio at December 31, 2012.
Operating properties at December 31, 2012 include development properties completed more than one year ago that may be in the initial lease-up phase, which reduces the overall leased percentage.



(2)

Certain properties are pledged as security under our secured mortgage debt and assessment bonds at December 31, 2012. For purposes of this table, the total
principal balance of a debt issuance that is secured by a pool of properties is allocated among the properties in the pool based on each property’s investment balance. In addition to the amounts reflected here, we also have a $44.3 million of
encumbrances related to other real estate properties not included in the Real Estate Operations segment. See Schedule III — Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
additional identification of the properties pledged.

(3)

Represents the total expected investment when the property under development is completed and leased. This includes the cost of land, development and leasing costs.

(4)

Included in other investments are: (i) certain non-industrial real estate; (ii) our corporate office buildings; (iii) land parcels that are ground leased
to third parties; (iv) certain infrastructure costs related to projects we are developing on behalf of others; (v) restricted funds that are held in escrow pending the completion of tax-deferred exchange transactions involving operating
properties; (vi) costs related to future development projects, including purchase options on land; and (vii) earnest money deposits associated with potential acquisitions.

In December 2012 and February 2013, we announced the formation of two new co-investment ventures in Europe and Japan, respectively. We have 207 operating
properties aggregating approximately $5.0 billion that we have contributed or expect to contribute these two entities in 2013. See further discussion below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.”

Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures

At December 31, 2012, we had investments in real estate properties, primarily industrial properties that we also manage, through our equity
investments in unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These investments include 1,163 properties aggregating 208.8 million square feet and a total gross book value of operating buildings of $17.6 billion. See further discussion in Note 6
to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we and our unconsolidated entities are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe
that, with respect to any such matters that we are currently a party to, the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

Dividends

In
order to comply with the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, we are generally required to make common and preferred stock dividends (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders in amounts that together at least equal
(i) the sum of (a) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains and (b) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus
(ii) certain excess non-cash income. Our common stock distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow that ensures that we will meet the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and that allows us to also retain
cash to meet other needs, such as capital improvements and other investment activities.

In 2012, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28
per common share. Our future common stock dividends may vary and will be determined by our Board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating results and REIT distribution requirements, and may be
adjusted at the discretion of the Board during the year.

In addition to common stock, at December 31, 2012, we had seven series of
preferred stock outstanding (“Series L Preferred Stock”, “Series M Preferred Stock”, “Series O Preferred Stock”, “Series P Preferred Stock”, “Series Q Preferred Stock”,
“Series R Preferred Stock” and “Series S Preferred Stock”).



Holders of each series of preferred stock outstanding have limited voting rights,
subject to certain conditions, and are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends based upon each series’ respective liquidation preference. Dividends for Series Q, R and S are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of March,
June, September and December. Dividends for Series L, M, O and P are payable quarterly in arrears on the 15

th

day of April, July, October and January. Dividends on preferred
stock are payable when, and if, they have been declared by the Board, out of funds legally available for payment of dividends. After the respective redemption dates, each series of preferred stock can be redeemed at our option. With respect to the
payment of dividends, each series of preferred stock ranks on parity with our other series of preferred stock. The following table sets forth the Company’s dividends paid or payable per share for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:

(1)

The dividends are different than the amounts disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The difference is due to the distinction between legal
and accounting acquirer. The pre-Merger information presented above is historical AMB amounts as it was the legal acquirer. The Series Q, R and S Preferred Stock was issued in connection with the Merger in 2011 and exchanged for the outstanding C, F
and G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of beneficial interest in ProLogis, respectively. Amounts reflect actual dividends paid or payable during 2011 subsequent to the Merger.

Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until
all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.

For more information regarding our dividends, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report and the matters
described under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.

Management’s Overview

At the time of the Merger, we established our key strategic priorities to guide our path through the end of 2013. These priorities were:

•

to align our portfolio with our investment strategy while serving the needs of our customers;

•

to strengthen our financial position and build one of the top balance sheets in the REIT industry;

•

to streamline our private capital business and position it for substantial growth;

•

to improve the utilization of our low yielding assets; and

•

to build the most effective and efficient organization in the REIT industry and to become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in
real estate as a career.

Align our Portfolio with our Investment Strategy

We have categorized our portfolio into three main segments – global, regional and other markets. By segmenting our markets in this manner, we were
able to construct a plan that includes culling the portfolio for buildings and potentially submarkets that are no longer a strategic fit. We expect to use the proceeds from dispositions to pay down debt that is secured by the disposed assets, if
any, repay other debt and to recycle capital into new development projects and/or strategic acquisitions.

Strengthen our Financial Position

We intend to further strengthen our financial position by lowering our financial risk and currency exposure and building one of the
strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry. We expect to lower our financial risk by reducing leverage and maintaining staggered debt maturities, which will increase our financial flexibility and provide for continued access to capital
markets. This financial flexibility will position us to capitalize on market opportunities across the entire business cycle as they arise. We expect to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations by borrowing in local
currency where appropriate, and utilizing derivative contracts to hedge our foreign denominated equity and swap U.S. dollar–denominated debt into obligations denominated in foreign currencies. We expect to also lower our foreign currency risk
by holding assets outside the United States primarily in co-investment ventures in which we maintain an ownership interest and provide services generating private capital revenue. We will accomplish this through contributions and sales to our
existing and newly formed co-investment ventures, including the new ventures in Europe and Japan discussed below. In addition, we expect that new development projects, particularly in those emerging markets such as Brazil, China and Mexico, will be
done in conjunction with our private capital partners.

Streamline Private Capital Business

We are working with our private capital investors to rationalize certain of our co-investment ventures. Some of our legacy co-investment ventures have fee
structures that do not adequately compensate us for the services we provide. Therefore, we have terminated or restructured certain of these co-investment ventures. In other cases, we may combine some co-investment ventures to gain operational
efficiencies. In every case, however, we have and will continue to work very closely with our partners and venture investors who have been and will be active participants in these decisions. We expect to continue with these activities during 2013.
We plan to grow our private capital business with the deployment of the private capital commitments we have already raised, formation of new co-investment ventures, including the new ventures in Europe and Japan, and raising incremental capital for
our existing co-investment ventures.



Improve the Utilization of Our Low Yielding Assets

We plan to increase the value of our low yielding assets by stabilizing our operating portfolio to 95% leased, completing the build-out and lease-up of
our development projects as well as monetizing our land through development or sale to third parties.

Build the most effective and
efficient organization in the REIT industry and become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career

We realized more than $115 million of cost synergies on an annualized basis, compared to the combined expenses of AMB and ProLogis on a pre-Merger basis.
These synergies included gross general and administrative savings, reduced global line of credit facility fees and lower amortization of non real estate assets. We will continue to look for and achieve additional savings opportunities. In addition,
we implemented a new enterprise wide system that includes a property management/billing system (implemented in April 2012), a human resources system (implemented in July 2012), a general ledger and accounting system and a data warehouse (implemented
in January 2013). In connection with this implementation, we are striving to utilize the most effective global business processes with the enhanced system functionality, and have also implemented several analytical tools to further empower and
assist our regional and local teams. In early 2012, we implemented two new compensation plans that we believe will better align employees’ compensation to our company performance. We believe these efforts and others will help us with the
attainment of this objective.

Summary of 2012

•

In support of our objective to streamline our private capital co-investment ventures, we successfully concluded five co-investment ventures (six since
the Merger) and one other unconsolidated joint venture (further discussed in Notes 3 and 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), as follows:

•

During the third quarter, we completed the delisting of PEPR from two European stock exchanges and we acquired 100% of its assets and liabilities. We
plan to contribute the majority of these properties to a new co-investment venture as discussed below.

•

During the first quarter, we acquired our partner’s interest in Prologis North America Fund II (“NAIF II”) and dissolved Prologis
California and divided the portfolio equally with our partner. In the fourth quarter, we dissolved Prologis North America Properties Fund I (“Fund I”) and divided the portfolio according to the ownership of each partner. These three
transactions increased our investment in real estate by $2.2 billion and our debt by $1.4 billion. We recognized net gains on acquisitions of real estate properties of $294.2 million as a result of adjusting our equity investment to fair value at
the time of consolidation. We refer to these transactions collectively as “Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions”.

•

We concluded Prologis North American Properties Fund XI by disposing of the remaining asset in the co-investment venture during the third quarter.

•

In the fourth quarter, we dissolved one of our other unconsolidated joint ventures and divided the portfolio according to the ownership of the
partners.

•

In December 2012, we announced our plan to form two new ventures in Japan and Europe:

•

On December 12, we announced the approval from our Board to sponsor a Japanese REIT (“J-REIT”) to serve as the long-term investment
vehicle for our properties developed in Japan. In early 2013, we launched the initial public offering for Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. (“NPR”). On February 14, 2013, NPR was listed on the Japan Stock Exchange and commenced trading.
At that time, NPR acquired a portfolio of 12 properties from us for an aggregate purchase price of ¥173 billion ($1.9 billion), resulting in ¥153 billion ($1.7 billion at February 14, 2013) in net cash proceeds. We will retain at least
a 15% equity ownership interest in NPR and will provide pipeline, operational and personnel assistance under a support agreement. As a result of this transaction, in the first quarter we will recognize a gain of approximately $300 million
after the deferral of the gain related to our ongoing investment. We intend to use the proceeds primarily for the repayment of debt and future investment in Japan.

•

On December 20, we signed a definitive agreement to form a euro-denominated co-investment venture, Prologis European Logistics Partners Sarl
(“PELP”). Our partner is Norges Bank Investment Management, which is the manager of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global. PELP will be structured as a 50/50 joint venture. The venture has an initial term of 15 years, which may
be extended for additional 15-year periods. We will have the ability to reduce our ownership to 20% following the second anniversary of closing. The venture will acquire a portfolio of high-quality properties currently owned by us in 11 target
European global markets. We expect to contribute 195 properties for total estimated proceeds of approximately of €2.3 billion ($3.1 billion at December 31, 2012). As the expected proceeds were less than our carrying cost at
December 31, 2012, we recognized an impairment charge of $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the expected contribution in March 2013. This charge represented the loss on the entire portfolio of properties and was driven
primarily by properties that we had developed during 2008 and 2009 at peak values.



•

Although our strategic objective is to further improve our credit metrics, we temporarily increased our total debt to $11.8 billion at
December 31, 2012 from $11.4 billion at December 31, 2011. Our significant debt activity during the year was as follows:

•

We increased our debt by $1.4 billion in connection with the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions, as discussed above.

•

We issued secured property-level debt on assets in Japan (known as TMK bonds) or increased existing TMK bonds for a combined amount of ¥49.0
billion ($569.0 million as of December 31, 2012).

•

We entered into a €487.5 million ($648.5 million as of December 31, 2012) multi-currency senior term loan agreement and used the
proceeds to pay off two outstanding term loans with the remainder used to pay down our credit facilities.

•

We repaid $1.9 billion of debt with the proceeds from dispositions and contributions of properties. In 2013, we plan to significantly reduce debt with
the proceeds received from contributions to the two co-investment ventures discussed above, along with other dispositions and contributions of properties as we align our portfolio with our investment strategy.

•

In order to reduce our exposure to the risk of movements in exchange rates, we entered into derivative contracts with an aggregate notional amount of
€1.0 billion to hedge our euro denominated net investment. These hedges qualify for hedge accounting. We plan to further reduce our currency risk by completing the contribution of real estate properties to co-investment ventures in Japan and
Europe in which we maintain an ownership interest (as discussed above).

•

We generated aggregate proceeds of $2.0 billion from the disposition of land, land subject to ground leases and 200 operating buildings to third
parties and the contribution of 25 operating buildings to three unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We used the proceeds primarily to reduce our outstanding debt, acquire real estate properties and fund our development activities. We recognized
net gains of $19.3 million in continuing operations and $65.9 million in discontinued operations as a result of these transactions.

•

We commenced construction of 40 projects on an owned and managed basis aggregating 16.9 million square feet with a total expected investment of
$1.6 billion (our share was $1.4 billion), including 20 projects (or 57% of the total expected investment) that were 100% leased prior to the start of development. We used $384.2 million of land we already owned for these projects. This represents
an increase in development activity that we expect to further increase in 2013.

•

We leased a total of 145.3 million square feet in our owned and managed portfolio and increased the occupancy of the total operating portfolio to
94.0% and 94.5% leased at December 31, 2012 as compared to 92.2% occupied and 92.5% leased at December 31, 2011.

•

We increased the percentage of our total owned and managed portfolio that is in global markets to 84.5% (based on gross investment balance).

Operational Outlook

The recovery in industrial real estate markets continues around the world. We believe all signals point to a positive outlook for our sector. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting global trade
growth at 3.8% for 2013 and approximately 5% for 2014. Improving industrial production and new goods orders also indicate strengthening economic growth. According to the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, inventories in the United
States have now been growing for the last 11 out of 12 quarters, and are almost back to their pre-crisis levels. We expect further rebuilding of inventories this year to levels that will surpass the previous peak. This increase in
inventories is driven primarily by the fact that the United States population has grown by 12 million during that same timeframe.

Total
net absorption during the fourth quarter was 56 million square feet according to CBRE, Inc., the strongest single quarter since 2006. The availability rate continues to fall (12.8% at December 31, 2012) and supply remains at historically
low levels. Further, as the recovery broadens throughout the United States, demand should increase across more of the major tenant business sectors, further reducing vacancy spaces smaller than 100,000 square feet. This segment is closely tied to
the recovery in the housing market and we expect demand to increase in the future. Thus, overall conditions in the United States industrial market should continue to improve and as such we are forecasting 150 million square feet of net
absorption in 2013.

In Europe, net absorption continues to be positive, and has been, since we began collecting the data series, in the first
quarter of 2011. The supply of class-A distribution space remains constrained in both Japan and China. We expect the supply chain reconfiguration in Japan and growing consumption in China to continue to drive demand for our product in the long-term.
Demand for class-A facilities remains strong in Latin America. Brazil continues to be an underserved logistics market as growing GDP and increasing consumption is driving high levels of new requirements into the market. Demand momentum has been
similarly positive in Mexico, benefitting from the economic recovery in the U.S. and increasingly frequent instances of ‘near-shoring’ of production activities. Net absorption has been positive for several years and market occupancy rates
increased 80 basis points to 91.5 percent during 2012 across the six largest markets.

In our total owned and managed operating portfolio, we
leased a record 145.3 million square feet of space in 2012. We ended the year with 94.0% occupancy in our owned and managed operating portfolio, up 180 basis points over year end 2011. The effective rental rates on leases signed during the
fourth quarter of 2012 in our same store portfolio (as defined below) decreased by 2.4% when compared with the rental



rates on the previous leases on that same space. The decline was primarily attributed to regional markets in Europe where leases were signed at the high point of the prior cycle. Rent change is
continuing its upward trend in our portfolio and we expect positive rollover in 2013. Tenant retention in the fourth quarter was 87.3%.

Due to
the lack of supply of class-A facilities, high space utilization rates and decreasing vacancy rates, we expect development volume to increase in our markets. Our development business comprises speculative development, build-to-suit development,
value-added conversions and redevelopment. We expect to develop directly and within our co-investment structures depending on location, market conditions, submarkets or building sites and availability of capital. In response to this increasing
demand, we are actively pursuing various development opportunities, and we commenced development of 40 properties in our owned and managed portfolio during 2012.

Results of Operations

Summary

The following table illustrates the net operating income for each of our segments, along with the reconciling items to

Loss from Continuing Operations

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):

See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our segments and
a reconciliation of net operating income to

Loss Before Income Taxes

.

Real Estate Operations Segment

The net operating income of the Real Estate Operations segment consisted of rental income and rental expenses from industrial properties that we own and
consolidate and is impacted by our capital deployment activities. This segment excludes amounts presented as

Discontinued Operations

in our Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods. The size and percentage of occupancy of our
consolidated operating portfolio fluctuates due to the timing of acquisitions, development activity and contributions. Such fluctuations affect the net operating income we recognize in this segment in a particular period. Also included in this
segment is revenue from land we own and lease to customers under ground leases and development management and other income, offset by acquisition, disposition and land holding costs. The net operating income from the Real Estate Operations segment
for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in thousands):

The increase in rental income and rental expense in 2012 from 2011 was due primarily to the impact of the Merger and the
PEPR Acquisition in the second quarter of 2011, the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions and other acquisitions in 2012 and increased occupancy in our consolidated operating properties (from 91.4% at December 31, 2011 to 93.7% at
December 31, 2012), including the completion and stabilization of new development properties. The results for 2012 included rental income and expenses from properties acquired through the Merger and PEPR Acquisition of $834.0 million and $228.9
million, respectively, while 2011 included approximately seven months of rental income and expense of properties acquired through the Merger and PEPR Acquisition of $524.7 million and $142.5 million, respectively. In our consolidated portfolio, we
leased 88.5 million square feet in 2012 compared to 63.4 million square feet in 2011.

over 2010 was due primarily to the impact of the Merger and the PEPR Acquisition in the second quarter of 2011, increased occupancy in our consolidated operating properties (from 85.9% at December 2010 to 91.4% at December 2011) and the completion
and stabilization of new development properties.



We calculate the change in effective rental rates on leases signed during the quarter as compared to the
previous rent on that same space in our same store portfolio (as defined below). During 2012 (over the four quarters), the percentage change in rental rates ranged from a decrease of 3.9% to a decrease of 1.1%. During 2011 (over the four quarters),
the percentage change in rental rates ranged from a decrease of 8.9% to a decrease of 4.5%. A decline in rental rates was due to: (i) leases turning that were put in place when market rents were at or near peak and (ii) decreased market
rents.

Under the terms of our lease agreements, we are able to recover the majority of our rental expenses from customers. Rental expense
recoveries, included in both rental income and rental expenses, were 74.0%, 73.7% and 75.6% of total rental expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Our consolidated operating properties as of December 31 were as follows (square feet in thousands):

(1)

The amount at December 31, 2011 included 848 properties with 126.3 million square feet that were acquired through the Merger and PEPR Acquisition.

As discussed earlier, we have 207 operating properties aggregating approximately $5.0 billion that we have contributed in 2013
or expect to contribute to NPR and PELP. As a result, we expect to have decreased rental income and rental expenses in 2013 in this segment. We will account for our continuing ownership in the properties through our equity ownership in the ventures
by recognizing our share of the net income or loss of the ventures. We will also recognize additional revenue in our Private Capital segment from the property management and asset management services we will provide.

Private Capital Segment

The net
operating income of the Private Capital segment consisted of fees and incentives earned for services performed for our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and certain joint ventures and third parties, reduced by our direct costs of
managing these entities and the properties they own.

The direct costs associated with our Private Capital segment totaled $63.8 million, $55.0
million and $40.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in the line item

Private Capital Expenses

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These expenses include the direct
expenses associated with the asset management of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures provided by our employees who are assigned to our Private Capital segment. In addition, in order to achieve efficiencies and economies of scale, all of our
property management functions are provided by a team of professionals who are assigned to our Real Estate Operations segment. These individuals perform the property-level management of the properties in our owned and managed portfolio including
properties we consolidate and the properties we manage that are owned by the unconsolidated entities. We allocate the costs of our property management function to the properties we consolidate (reported in

Rental Expenses

) and the properties
owned by the unconsolidated entities (included in

Private Capital Expenses

), by using the square feet owned by the respective portfolios. The increase in Private Capital Expenses in 2012 is due to the increased private capital platform and
infrastructure that was part of the Merger, offset partially with a decline in the portion of our property management expenses that are allocated to this segment due to the consolidation of PEPR in June 2011 and the Co-Investment Venture
Acquisitions in 2012.

The net operating income from the Private Capital segment, representing fees earned reduced by private capital expenses,
for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in thousands):

(1)

Represents the fees earned by us from several unconsolidated entities. The decrease in net operating income in 2012 is due to the successful conclusion of four
co-investment ventures in the United States during the year. As of December 31, 2012, we had six co-investment ventures (three in the United States, two in Mexico and one in Brazil). In 2011, the net operating income increased as a result of
three new ventures acquired as part of the Merger, offset with a decrease due to the sale of properties in three ventures. In 2010, we had ten co-investment ventures and sold our interests in three of these ventures in December 2010.



(2)

Represents the fees earned by us from several unconsolidated entities. In 2012, we had three co-investment ventures. In 2011, we had one co-investment venture during
the entire year, we included PEPR up to the date we began consolidating at the end of May 2011, and added two co-investment ventures acquired through the Merger. In 2010 we had two co-investment ventures.

(3)

Represents the fees earned by us from several unconsolidated entities. In 2012, we had two co-investment ventures. In 2011, we acquired an investment in an
unconsolidated co-investment venture in each of Japan and China in connection with the Merger, and sold our investment in the South Korea co-investment venture during the third quarter. In 2010, we only had one co-investment venture, which was in
South Korea.

We expect the net operating income of this segment to increase in 2013 due to NPR and PELP and from the
contributions of properties to existing co-investment ventures, offset slightly by the decrease in revenue from some other co-investment ventures as they are concluded.

See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information on our unconsolidated entities.

Other Components of Income

General and Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses

G&A expenses for the years ended December 31 consisted of the following (in thousands):

The increase in G&A expenses and the various components from 2011 to 2012 and from 2010 to 2011 was due principally to
the larger infrastructure associated with the combined company following the Merger and the PEPR Acquisition. The increase in capitalized G&A is due to our increased development and leasing activities since the Merger.

We capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities. Capitalized G&A expenses included salaries and related costs,
as well as other general and administrative costs. The capitalized G&A costs for the years ended December 31, was as follows (in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the capitalized salaries and related costs represented 19.1%,
19.3% and 16.1%, respectively, of our total capitalizable salaries and related costs. In addition, in 2012, we capitalized $1.2 million of salaries and related costs related to internally developed software that were included as

Merger,
Acquisition and Other Integration Expenses

. Salaries and related costs are comprised primarily of wages, other compensation and employee-related expenses. In 2012, we began consolidated development projects with a total expected investment of
$1.3 billion ($0.6 billion in the fourth quarter) as compared to $0.8 billion in 2011. As discussed earlier, we expect our development activity to continue to increase in 2013.

Merger, Acquisition and Other Integration Expenses

In connection with the Merger and other
related activities, we incurred significant transaction, integration and transitional costs of $80.7 million and $140.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We believe the majority of these costs have been
realized as of December 31, 2012 and any additional costs incurred in 2013 will be included in

G&A Expenses

. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more detail on these expenses.

Impairment of Real Estate Properties

During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized impairment charges of real estate properties in continuing operations of $252.9 million, $21.2 million and
$736.6 million, respectively, due to our change of intent to no longer hold these assets for long-term investment. In 2012, these impairment charges related to our planned contribution of properties to PELP ($135.3 million), land parcels that
we expected to sell to third parties ($88.9 million) and operating buildings we expected to contribute or sell ($28.7 million). In 2010, the charges primarily included land as a result of our change in strategy. Changes in economic and operating
conditions and our ultimate intent with regard to our



investments in real estate that occur in the future may result in additional impairment charges or gains at the time of sale. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
for more detail on the process we took to value these assets and the related impairment charges recognized.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization was $740.0 million, $552.8 million and $294.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011
and 2010, respectively. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is due to additional depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the assets (including intangible assets) acquired in the Merger and PEPR Acquisition during the second quarter of 2011
and the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions in 2012, as well as completed and leased development properties and additional leasing and capital improvements in our operating properties. The increase from 2010 to 2011 is primarily due to additional
depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the properties acquired through the Merger and PEPR Acquisition, completed and leased development properties and increased leasing activity.

Earnings from Unconsolidated Entities, Net

We recognized net earnings of $31.7 million, $59.9 million and $23.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
These earnings relate to our investment in unconsolidated entities that are accounted for on the equity method. The earnings decreased in 2012 from 2011 due to the consolidation of PEPR and the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions, as such ventures
were previously accounted for under the equity method. This decrease was partially offset by earnings from investments acquired through the Merger. In 2012, we recorded a loss of $9.3 million for our share of a loss on the early extinguishment of
debt in Prologis North American Industrial Fund III. The primary reason for the increase in 2011 over 2010 is due to the investments we acquired through the Merger, partially offset by the consolidation of PEPR. The earnings we recognize are
impacted by: (i) variances in revenues and expenses of the entity; (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by the entity; (iii) our ownership interest in the entity; and (iv) fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to U.S. dollars, if applicable. We manage the majority of the properties in which we have an ownership interest as part of our total owned and managed portfolio. See discussion of
our portfolio results in the section, “Portfolio Information”. See also Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.

We expect increases in earnings from unconsolidated entities in 2013 due to our share of net earnings from NPR and PELP that we expect to recognize after
contributions made in 2013.

Interest Expense

Interest expense from continuing operations included the following components (in thousands) for the years ended December 31:

Gross interest expense increased in 2012 and 2011 from the previous year primarily due to higher debt levels as a result
of the Merger, the PEPR Acquisition and the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions in 2012, partially offset by lower effective borrowing costs and replacement of debt at lower rates.

Although our strategic objective is to reduce our debt and leverage with proceeds from property dispositions, we temporarily increased our debt in 2012 by $1.4 billion from the Co-Investment Venture
Acquisitions. We plan to pay down debt with the proceeds from the contribution of properties in early 2013 and disposition of properties in 2013. As a result of the Merger and PEPR Acquisition, we added approximately $5.9 billion of debt at fair
value at the beginning of June 2011 and approximately seven months of related interest expense in 2011, which increased our debt balance as of December 31, 2011 to $11.4 billion. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 and Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs.

Our weighted average effective
borrowing cost was 4.6%, 5.6% and 6.5% for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our future interest expense, both gross interest and the portion capitalized, will vary depending on, among other things, our effective
borrowing rate and the level of our development activities.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Assets

Based on our review of goodwill in 2010, we recognized an impairment charge of $368.5 million related to goodwill allocated to the Real Estate Operations
segment in the Americas and Europe reporting units. The review of goodwill was triggered by the strategic decision we made in the fourth quarter of 2010 to significantly downsize our development platform and, as a result, to sell to third parties
certain other assets, some of which were acquired in the acquisitions that originally created the goodwill.



In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded impairment charges of $16.1 million, $126.4 million and $44.3
million, respectively, on certain of our investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities, notes receivable and other assets, as we did not believe these amounts to be recoverable based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows
associated with these assets, including estimated sales proceeds, or we believed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary.

See
Notes 2 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information on our process with regard to analyzing the recoverability of goodwill and other assets.

Gains on Acquisitions and Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net

In 2012, we
recognized net gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of $305.6 million, which included $294.2 million of gains related to the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions and $11.4 million of gains
principally related to contribution activity. We received proceeds of $381.9 million from the contribution of 25 properties aggregating 4.8 million square feet.

During 2011, we recognized net gains on acquisitions and dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of $111.7 million. This included gains recognized in the second quarter related
to the PEPR Acquisition ($85.9 million) and the acquisition of our partner’s interest in one of our other unconsolidated joint ventures in Japan ($13.5 million). The gains represent the adjustment to fair value of our equity investments at the
time we gained control and consolidated the entities. The contribution activity in 2011 resulted in cash proceeds of $590.8 million and net gains of $12.3 million.

During 2010, we recognized net gains on dispositions of investments in real estate in continuing operations of $28.5 million, which related to the contribution of land and operating properties to
unconsolidated entities ($58.3 million gain), additional proceeds from contributions we made to PEPF II in 2009 based on valuations received as of December 31, 2010 and our contribution agreement with the venture ($27.4 million gain) and the
sale of land parcels to third parties ($7.4 million gain), offset by a loss of $64.6 million related to the sale of certain unconsolidated entities.

The 2010 contribution activity resulted in cash proceeds of $469.7 million related to the contribution of development properties aggregating 2.1 million square feet and land to unconsolidated
entities, and the sale of 90% of two development properties in Japan aggregating 1.3 million square feet. We continue to own 10% of the Japan properties, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and we continue to manage
the properties.

If we realize a gain on contribution or sale of a property to an unconsolidated entity, we recognize the portion attributable
to the third party ownership in the entity. If we realize a loss on contribution, we recognize the full amount as soon as it is known. Due to our continuing involvement through our ownership in the unconsolidated entity, these dispositions are not
included in discontinued operations.

Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses), Net

We and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries may have intercompany or third party debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional
currency. When the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity, a gain or loss may result. To mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure, we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate.
Certain of our intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in

Foreign Currency Translation Loss, Net

in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). This
treatment is applicable to intercompany debt that is deemed to be long-term in nature.

If the intercompany debt is deemed short-term in
nature, when the debt is remeasured, we recognize a gain or loss in earnings. We recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $7.4 million in 2012, and losses of $5.9 million and $11.5 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to the
remeasurement of debt. Predominantly the gains or losses recognized in earnings relate to the remeasurement of intercompany loans between the United States parent and certain consolidated subsidiaries in Japan and Europe and result from
fluctuations in the exchange rates of U.S. dollar to the euro, Japanese yen and British pound sterling. In addition, we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $5.6 million, and gains of $2.1 million and $0.4 million from the
settlement of transactions with third parties during December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

We recognized an unrealized loss of
$22.3 million in 2012 and an unrealized gain of $45.0 million in 2011 on the derivative instrument (exchange feature) related to our exchangeable senior notes, which became exchangeable at the time of the Merger.

Gains (Losses) on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net

During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we purchased portions of several series of senior notes, senior exchangeable notes and Eurobonds outstanding and extinguished some secured
mortgage debt prior to maturity, which resulted in the recognition of losses of $14.1 million in 2012, gains of $0.3 million in 2011, and losses of $201.5 million in 2010. The gains or losses represent the difference between the recorded debt (net
of premiums and discounts and including related debt issuance costs) and the consideration we paid to retire the debt, including fees. Included in this amount in 2012 are losses that were included in

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

in our
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to hedge transactions and were deemed unrecoverable in the fourth quarter of 2012. These hedges were associated with debt that is expected to be repaid before maturity in Europe with the
proceeds from the contributions to PELP in early 2013. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information regarding our debt repurchases.



Income Tax Benefit (Expense)

During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, our current income tax expense was $17.9 million, $21.6 million and $21.7 million, respectively. We recognize current income tax expense for
income taxes incurred by our taxable REIT subsidiaries and in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as certain state taxes. We also include in current income tax expense the interest associated with our liability for uncertain tax positions. Our
current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income and changes in tax and interest rates.

In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized a net deferred tax benefit of $14.3 million, $19.8 million and $52.2 million, respectively. Deferred income tax expense is generally a function of the
period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in certain of our taxable subsidiaries operating in the United States or
in foreign jurisdictions. The deferred tax benefit recorded during 2010 is primarily due to impairment charges recorded to the book basis of real estate properties and investments in unconsolidated entities, net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryforwards recorded for certain jurisdictions, and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to built-in-gains. In addition, during the second quarter of 2010, we recognized a deferred income tax benefit of approximately $27.5 million
resulting from the conversion of two of our European management companies to taxable entities. This conversion was approved by the applicable tax authorities in June 2010 and created an asset for tax purposes that will be utilized against future
taxable income as it is amortized. The deferred tax benefit was partially offset by an increase to the valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions because we could not sustain a conclusion that it was more likely than not that we could realize the
deferred tax assets and NOL carryforwards.

Our income taxes are discussed in more detail in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations represent a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be
eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction. The results of operations
that have been classified as discontinued operations are reported separately in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

During
2012, 2011 and 2010, we disposed of land subject to ground leases and 200, 94 and 205 operating properties, respectively, to third parties that met the requirements to be classified as discontinued operations. We recognized aggregate net gains on
these transactions, net of impairment charges, of $35.1 million, $58.6 million and $234.6 million during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The results of operations of these properties for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $27.6 million, $50.6 million and
$96.5 million, respectively.

See Notes 4 and 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – Foreign Currency Translation Losses, Net

For our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries’ financial
statements. Generally, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments, due to the fluctuations in exchange rates from the beginning of the period to the end of
the period, are included in

Foreign Currency Translation Losses, Net

in our

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)

.

During 2012, we recorded unrealized net losses of $79.0 million as the Japanese yen rates weakened to the U.S. dollar by 10.1% from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012, offset slightly by the
euro and British pound sterling slightly strengthening against the U.S. dollar during the same period. During 2011, we recorded unrealized net losses of $192.6 million as the euro and British pound sterling remained relatively flat from
December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, but both weakened to the U.S. dollar from the Merger and PEPR Acquisition date to December 31, 2011. These losses were offset slightly by the strengthening of the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar
during 2011. During 2010, we recognized unrealized net losses of $45.2 million mainly as a result of the weakening of the euro and British pound sterling to the U.S. dollar, offset by the Japanese yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar, from the
beginning of the year to December 31, 2010.

Portfolio Information

Our total owned and managed properties includes operating industrial properties but not properties under development, properties held for sale or
non-industrial properties and was as follows as of December 31 (square feet in thousands):



Same Store Analysis

We evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period,
thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures. We include properties from our consolidated portfolio, and properties owned by the co-investment ventures (accounted for on the equity method)
that are managed by us (referred to as “unconsolidated entities”), including those owned and managed by AMB prior to the Merger, in our same store analysis. We have defined the same store portfolio, for the three months ended
December 31, 2012, as those properties that were in operation at January 1, 2011 and have been in operation throughout the same three-month periods in both 2012 and 2011. We have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third
party or were classified as held for sale from the population for both periods. We believe the factors that impact rental income, rental expenses and net operating income in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total portfolio.
In order to derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the current exchange rate to translate from local currency into U.S. dollars, for
both periods. The same store portfolio, for the three months ended December 31, 2012, included 502.0 million of aggregated square feet.

The following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental income, rental expenses and net operating income (calculated as rental income and recoveries less rental expenses) for the full year, as
included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in Item 8, to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis (dollars in thousands).



(1)

As discussed above, our same store portfolio includes industrial properties from our consolidated portfolio and owned by the unconsolidated entities (accounted for on
the equity method) that are managed by us. During the periods presented, certain properties owned by us were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio on an aggregate basis. Neither our consolidated results
nor those of the unconsolidated entities, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis due to the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (for example, the results of a contributed property
are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the unconsolidated entities subsequent to the contribution date).

(2)

We exclude the net termination and renegotiation fees from our same store rental income to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property’s rental
income without regard to items that are not indicative of the property’s recurring operating performance. Net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease,
offset by the write-off of the asset recognized due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. The adjustments to remove these items are included as “effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other” in the
tables above.

(3)

These amounts include activity of both our consolidated industrial properties and those owned by our unconsolidated entities (accounted for on the equity method) and
managed by us.

(4)

Rental expenses in the same store portfolio include the direct operating expenses of the property such as property taxes, insurance, utilities, etc. In
addition, we include an allocation of the property management expenses for our direct-owned properties based on the property management fee that is provided for in the individual management agreements under which our wholly owned management
companies provide property management services to each property (generally, the fee is based on a percentage of revenues). On consolidation, the management fee income earned by the management companies and the management fee expense recognized by
the



properties are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expenses. These expenses fluctuate based on the level of
properties included in the same store portfolio and any adjustment is included as “effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other” in the above table.

Environmental Matters

A majority of the properties acquired by
us were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we
believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We record a liability for the
estimated costs of environmental remediation to be incurred in connection with certain operating properties we acquire, as well as certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the planned development of the land. The liability is established
to cover the environmental remediation costs, including cleanup costs, consulting fees for studies and investigations, monitoring costs and legal costs relating to cleanup, litigation defense, and the pursuit of responsible third parties. We
purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

We consider our ability to
generate cash from operating activities, dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements.

Near-Term Principal Cash Sources and Uses

In addition to dividends to the common and preferred stockholders of Prologis, Inc. and distributions to the limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership, we expect our primary cash needs will
consist of the following:

•

repayment of debt including payments on our credit facilities and scheduled principal payments in 2013 of $1.5 billion;

•

completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio (

a

);

•

development of new properties for long-term investment, including the acquisition of land in certain markets;

•

capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio;

•

additional investments in current unconsolidated entities or new investments in future unconsolidated entities;

•

depending on market and other conditions, acquisition of operating properties and/or portfolios of operating properties in global or regional markets
for direct, long-term investment (this might include acquisitions from our co-investment ventures); and

•

depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, we may repurchase our outstanding
debt or equity securities through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise.

(a)

As of December 31, 2012, we had 45 properties in our development portfolio that were 57.4% leased with a current investment of $959.6 million and a total
expected investment of $1.7 billion when completed and leased, leaving $759.3 million remaining to be spent.

We expect to fund
our cash needs principally from the following sources, all subject to market conditions:

•

available unrestricted cash balances ($100.8 million at December 31, 2012);

•

property operations;

•

fees and incentives earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures and distributions received from the co-investment ventures;

•

proceeds from the disposition of properties, land parcels or other investments to third parties;

•

proceeds from the contributions or sales of properties to current or future co-investment ventures, including our planned contributions to NPR and
PELP;

•

borrowing capacity under our current credit facility arrangements discussed below ($1.2 billion available as of December 31, 2012), other
facilities or borrowing arrangements;



•

proceeds from the issuance of equity securities; and

•

proceeds from the issuance of debt securities, including secured mortgage debt.

Debt

As of December 31, 2012, we
had $11.8 billion of debt. During 2012 we temporarily increased our debt by $1.4 billion as part of the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions and the issuance of $493.1 million of new debt, offset partially by repayments of debt.

As of December 31, 2012, we had credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $2.1 billion, of which $1.2 billion was available remaining
capacity.

As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. These covenants include customary financial
covenants for total debt ratios, encumbered debt ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios.

In February 2013, we entered into a $500 million
bridge loan under which we can borrow in U.S. dollar, euro or yen. We borrowed ¥20 billion under the bridge loan to make our initial cash investment in NPR. As discussed earlier, on February 14, 2013 we closed on the contribution of
properties to NPR and received ¥153 billion ($1.7 billion) in net cash proceeds, which were used to pay down existing secured mortgage debt on the properties being contributed, the borrowings outstanding on this bridge loan and the remainder
will be used to repay the outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities.

In connection with the PELP contribution, we expect to use the
proceeds to further reduce debt and to fund our development and acquisition activities.

See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 for further information on our debt.

Equity Commitments Related to Certain Co-Investment Ventures

Certain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. We may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of
properties or cash. Our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. We are committed to offer to contribute certain properties that we develop and stabilize in select markets in Europe, Mexico and Japan to certain co-investment
ventures. These ventures are committed to acquire such properties, subject to certain exceptions, including that the properties meet certain specified leasing and other criteria, and that the ventures have available capital. Generally the venture
obtains financing for the properties and therefore the equity commitment is less than the acquisition price of the real estate. We are not obligated to contribute properties at a loss. Depending on market conditions, the investment objectives of the
ventures, our liquidity needs and other factors, we may make contributions of properties to these ventures through the remaining commitment period.

The following table is a summary of remaining equity commitments as of December 31, 2012 (in millions):



(1)

We secured $295.5 million in commitments from third parties in 2012 in order to fund future acquisitions from us and third parties that meet the venture’s
investment strategy, or to pay down existing debt. During 2012, the venture called capital of $265.5 million from these investors primarily to fund third party acquisitions.

(2)

These equity commitments will be called only if needed to pay outstanding debt of the venture. The relevant debt was due in 2012, which was automatically extended until
the third quarter of 2013. There is also an option to extend until the third quarter of 2014.

(3)

Equity commitments are denominated in euro and reported above in U.S. dollar. During 2012, this venture acquired two buildings from third parties with capital
previously called. Also during 2012, this venture called capital of €136.0 million ($178.6 million) of which €20.4 million ($26.8 million) represented our share to fund the contribution of nine buildings from us and the
acquisition of one building from a third party.

our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $463.5 million, $207.1 million and $240.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, cash provided by operating activities was less than the cash dividends paid on common and preferred stock by $104.3 million, $207.0 million and $65.3 million, respectively. We used proceeds from the disposition
of real estate properties ($2.0 billion in 2012, $1.6 billion in both 2011 and 2010) to fund dividends on common and preferred stock not covered by cash flows from operating activities.

Cash Investing and Cash Financing Activities

For the years ended December 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010, investing activities provided net cash of $529.6 million, used net cash of $233.1 million and provided net cash of $733.3 million, respectively. The following are the significant activities for all periods presented:

•

We generated cash from contributions and dispositions of properties and land parcels of $2.0 billion in 2012 and $1.6 billion in both 2011 and 2010. In
2012, we disposed of land, land subject to ground leases and 200 operating properties and contributed 25 operating properties to unconsolidated entities. We have a stated objective to reduce debt that we expect to achieve in part with proceeds
received from sales and contributions of properties and, therefore, expect this activity to continue. In 2011, we disposed of land, land subject to ground leases and 94 operating properties that included the majority of our non-industrial assets and
contributed 57 operating properties to unconsolidated entities. In 2010, we disposed of land and 205 operating properties and contributed 9 operating properties to unconsolidated entities.

•

In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we invested $793.3 million, $811.0 million and $324.5 million, respectively, in real estate development and leasing costs for
first generation leases. We have 30 properties under development and 15 properties that are completed but not stabilized as of December 31, 2012 and we expect to continue to develop new properties as the opportunities arise.

•

We invested $214.2 million, $144.1 million and $85.8 million in our operating properties during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which included
recurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions on existing operating properties that were previously leased. The increase in 2012 is primarily a result of our larger portfolio from the Merger, PEPR Acquisition and
Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions and our significant leasing activity.

•

In 2012, we acquired 1,537 acres of land and 12 operating properties aggregating 1.6 million square feet for a combined total of $254.4 million.
In 2011, we acquired 78 acres of land and 8 operating properties aggregating 1.5 million square feet for a combined total of $214.8 million. In 2010, we acquired 33 acres of land and 10 operating properties aggregating 2.4 million square
feet for a combined total of $133.7 million.

•

In connection with the acquisition of NAIF II in 2012, we repaid the loan from NAIF II to our partner for a total of $336.1 million. Also in 2012, we
paid $47.8 million in connection with the acquisition of two of our unconsolidated entities.

•

In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we invested cash of $165.0 million, $37.8 million and $335.4 million, respectively, in unconsolidated entities net of repayment
of advances by the entities. Our investment in 2012 primarily relates to an increase in our unconsolidated joint ventures in Brazil.

•

We received distributions from unconsolidated entities as a return of investment of $291.7 million, $170.2 million and $220.2 million during 2012, 2011
and 2010, respectively. We received $95.0 million during 2012, which represented a return of capital, from one of our other joint ventures that held a note receivable that was repaid during the year.

•

In 2012 we received a full redemption of a $55.0 million note receivable that was issued in 2011 through the sale of non-industrial assets. In 2010, we
invested $188.0 million in a preferred equity interest in a subsidiary of a buyer of a portfolio of assets and we purchased an $81.0 million loan to NAIF II from the lender.

•

In connection with the Merger in 2011, we acquired $234.0 million in cash.



•

During the second quarter of 2011, we used $1.0 billion of cash to purchase units in PEPR. The acquisition was funded with borrowings on a new
€500 million bridge facility (“PEPR Bridge Facility”), put in place for the acquisition, and borrowings under our other credit facilities that were subsequently paid from our equity offering (see below for more detail).

For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, financing activities used net cash of $1.1 billion, provided net
cash of $163.3 million and used net cash of $1.0 billion, respectively. The following are the significant activities for all periods presented:

•

In 2012, we repurchased and extinguished exchangeable senior notes, secured mortgage debt, senior term loans, and secured mortgage and other debt of
consolidated entities for $1.7 billion. In 2011 and 2010, we repurchased and extinguished senior notes, exchangeable senior notes and secured mortgage debt for $894.2 million and $3.1 billion, respectively.

•

In 2012, we incurred $1.4 billion of debt, principally secured mortgage debt and senior term loan debt. We used the proceeds from the senior term loan
to pay off the two outstanding term loans assumed in connection with the Merger and the remainder to pay down borrowings on our credit facilities. In 2011, we incurred $577.9 million in secured mortgage debt and borrowed $721.0 million on the PEPR
Bridge Facility. In 2010, we issued $1.1 billion of senior notes due 2017 and 2020 and $460.0 million of exchangeable senior notes due 2015. The proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our credit facilities. We also incurred $300.3 million in
secured mortgage debt.

•

We received net proceeds on our credit facilities of $9.1 million in 2012 and borrowed a net $37.6 million and $246.3 million in 2011 and 2010,
respectively. In connection with the Merger in 2011, we repaid the outstanding balance under our existing global line of credit and entered into new credit facilities.

•

We made net payments of $196.7 million, $975.5 million and $257.5 million on regularly scheduled debt principal and maturity payments during 2012, 2011
and 2010, respectively. In 2011, we used $711.8 million in proceeds from our equity offering to repay the amounts borrowed under the PEPR Bridge Facility. Additionally, 2011 activity included the repayment of €101.3 million ($146.8
million) of the euro notes that matured in April 2011.

•

We generated proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our incentive stock plans, principally stock options, of $31.0 million in 2012. We had
minimal activity in 2011. We generated proceeds from the sale and issuance of common stock under our various common share plans of $30.8 million during 2010, primarily from our at-the-market equity issuance program. The at-the-market equity program
was terminated in connection with the Merger.

•

We paid distributions of $520.3 million, $387.1 million and $280.7 million to our common stockholders during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We paid
dividends on our preferred stock of $47.6 million, $27.0 million and $25.4 million during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

•

As part of the liquidation of PEPR, we made payments of $117.3 million in 2012 to purchase additional units of PEPR. Also in 2012, we purchased shares
in Prologis Institutional Alliance Fund II for $14.1 million and our partner’s interest in certain properties in the Brazil Fund of $4.4 million and redeemed units of our limited partners in the Operating Partnership for cash of $5.8 million.

•

In 2012 and 2011, noncontrolling interest partners made contributions of $70.8 million and $123.9 million, respectively, primarily for the purchase of
real estate properties by our consolidated co-investment venture, Mexico Fondo Logistico. In addition, we distributed $44.1 million and $17.4 million to various noncontrolling interests in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

•

In June 2011, we completed an equity offering and issued 34.5 million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $1.1
billion. The proceeds were used to repay the PEPR Bridge Facility completely and the remainder was used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities. In 2010, we received net proceeds of $1.1 billion from the issuance
of 41.1 million common shares.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures Debt

We had investments in and advances to certain unconsolidated co-investment ventures at December 31, 2012 of $2.0 billion. These unconsolidated
ventures had total third party debt of $7.2 billion (in the aggregate, not our proportionate share) at December 31, 2012. This debt is primarily secured or collateralized by properties within the venture and is non-recourse to Prologis or the
other investors in the co-investment ventures and matures as follows (in millions):

(1)

As of December 31, 2012, we had guaranteed $30.4 million of the third party debt of the co-investment ventures. In our role as the manager, we work with the
co-investment ventures to refinance their maturing debt. There can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. If the ventures are unable
to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. Certain of the ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered
properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds. Generally, the co-investment ventures issue long-term debt and utilize the proceeds to repay borrowings under the credit facilities.

(2)

This venture is working with the lender to extend the maturity of this debt and may also sell properties and use the proceeds to repay debt.

(3)

This venture expects to pay 2013 maturities through asset sales, equity contributions and the issuance of new debt.

(4)

This venture expects to sell certain properties in 2013 and use the proceeds to repay debt.

Contractual Obligations

Long-Term Contractual Obligations

We had long-term contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 as follows (in millions):

(1)

We had properties in our development portfolio (completed and under development) at December 31, 2012 with a total expected investment of $1.7 billion. The
unfunded commitments presented include not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under construction contracts, but all costs necessary to place the property into service, including the estimated costs of tenant improvements, marketing and
leasing costs that we will incur as the property is leased.



Other Commitments

On a continuing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition and/or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties.

Distribution and Dividend Requirements

Our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure we will meet the dividend requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code, relative to maintaining our REIT status, while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities.

In 2012, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per common share. A cash dividend of $0.28 for the first quarter of 2013 was declared on February 27, 2013. This dividend will be paid on
March 29, 2013 to holders of common shares on March 12, 2013. Our future common stock dividends may vary and will be determined by our Board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating
results and REIT distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the Board during the year.

At December 31, 2012, we
had seven series of preferred stock outstanding. The annual dividend rates on preferred stock are 6.5% per Series L share, 6.75% per Series M share, 7.0% per Series O share, 6.85% per Series P share, 8.54% per Series Q
share, 6.75% per Series R share and 6.75% per Series S share. The dividends on preferred stock are payable quarterly in arrears.

Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until
all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock has been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.

Critical Accounting Policies

A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally,
the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and
expectations for the future. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of
operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Of the accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, those
presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill

We assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.

Recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying
amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our
intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change, as well as other factors, especially in the current global economic environment. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques; including
discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property, quoted market values and third party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions
that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow
basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We perform an annual impairment test for goodwill at the
reporting unit level. The annual review is performed during the fourth quarter for all our reporting units. Additionally, we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of
goodwill may not be fully recoverable.

In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting
standard update that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to
perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. We utilized the qualitative assessment for our 2012 annual impairment test.

Assumptions and
estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent
to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties and/or goodwill.

Other than Temporary Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

When circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If we determine there is a loss in value
that is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the



investment at fair value. The use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value, the determination of when a loss is other than temporary, and the calculation of the amount of
the loss, is complex and subjective. Use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions. Changes in economic and operating conditions, as well as changes in our intent with regard to our investment, that occur subsequent to
our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments.

Revenue Recognition –
Gains on Disposition of Real Estate

We recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets, generally at the time the
title is transferred, consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold. In many of our transactions, an entity in which we have an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from
us. We make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that
acquires the assets. We also make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives based on when they are earned, fixed and determinable.

Business Combinations

We acquire individual properties, as well as portfolios of
properties, or businesses. When we acquire a business or individual operating properties, with the intention to hold the investment for the long-term, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair
value of each component. The components typically include land, building, debt, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, value of costs to obtain tenants, deferred tax liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities in the
case of an acquisition of a business. In an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often times is
based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. The fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay
for a portfolio of properties. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price
allocation are made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year.

Consolidation

We consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which
we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which
enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Investments in
entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method. Investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do
not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, as appropriate. Our ability to correctly assess our influence and/or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated
financial statements.

Capitalization of Costs and Depreciation

We capitalize costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating, and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate
assets are expensed as incurred. During the land development and construction periods, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development, renovations, and
rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets. We also capitalize costs incurred to
successfully originate a lease that result directly from, and are essential to, the acquisition of that lease. Leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of other assets.

We estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense. Our ability to estimate
the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets. Any change to the assets to be
depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to estimate our
income tax liability, the liability associated with open tax years that are under review and our compliance with REIT requirements. Our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws. We estimate our actual current income tax due and assess
temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. These estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized.
Adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain non-routine transactions, changes due to audit adjustments by
federal and state tax authorities, our inability to qualify as a REIT, the potential for built-in-gain recognition, changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable REIT subsidiaries and changes in tax laws. Adjustments required
in any given period are included within income tax expense. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is “more-likely-than-not” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.



Derivative Financial Instruments

All derivatives are recognized at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets within the line items

Other Assets

or

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses

, as applicable. We do not net our
derivative position by counterparty for purposes of balance sheet presentation and disclosure. The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives are
designated as, and qualify as, hedging instruments. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

For derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments in accordance with the accounting standards, we formally designate and document, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a
specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, we formally assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging
transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. Any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instrument’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in
earnings. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and may be used to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and variable interest rates but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations
are recorded in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative
instruments will generally be offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are
immediately recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, we reclassify changes in the fair value of derivatives into the applicable line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period
that the underlying hedged items affect earnings.

New Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Funds from Operations (“FFO”)

FFO is a non-GAAP
measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings. Although the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) has published a definition of FFO,
modifications to the NAREIT calculation of FFO are common among REITs, as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business.

FFO is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present, nor do we intend it to present, a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance.
We believe net earnings computed under GAAP remains the primary measure of performance and that FFO is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP. Further, we believe our consolidated financial statements,
prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance.

NAREIT’s
FFO measure adjusts net earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We agree that these NAREIT adjustments are useful
to investors for the following reasons:

(i)

historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes, through depreciation charges, that the value of real estate assets diminishes
predictably over time. NAREIT stated in its White Paper on FFO “since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate
companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.” Consequently, NAREIT’s definition of FFO reflects the fact that real estate, as an asset class, generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges
required by GAAP do not reflect the underlying economic realities.

(ii)

REITs were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the
business of long-term ownership and management of real estate. The exclusion, in NAREIT’s definition of FFO, of gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows
investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT’s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. We include the gains and losses from dispositions
and impairment charges of land and development properties, as well as our proportionate share of the gains and losses from dispositions and impairment charges recognized by our unconsolidated entities, in our definition of FFO.

Our FFO Measures

At the same time that NAREIT created and defined its FFO measure for the REIT industry, it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to
publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community.” We believe stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined FFO measure



that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under GAAP in addition to those included in the NAREIT defined measure of FFO. Our FFO measures are used by management in analyzing our
business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses.

We use these FFO measures, including by segment and region, to: (i) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods,
relative to resource allocation decisions; (ii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (iv) assess our performance as compared to similar real
estate companies and the industry in general; and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. Because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long-term outlook, we believe it is appropriate
to remove the effects of short-term items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long-term performance of the properties. The long-term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income. While not infrequent or unusual,
these additional items we exclude in calculating

FFO, as defined by Prologis

, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent
and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.

We use our FFO measures as supplemental financial measures of
operating performance. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed
under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.

FFO, as defined by Prologis

To arrive at

FFO, as defined by Prologis

, we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude:

(i)

deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;

(ii)

current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset
with a deferred income tax benefit in GAAP earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure;

(iii)

foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated
entities;

(iv)

foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement (based on current foreign currency exchange rates) of certain third party debt of our foreign
consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities; and

(v)

mark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments.

We calculate

FFO, as defined by Prologis

for our unconsolidated entities on the same basis as we calculate our

FFO, as defined by Prologis

.

We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating
results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy.

Core FFO

In addition to

FFO, as defined by Prologis,

we also use Core FFO

.

To arrive at

Core FFO,

we adjust

FFO, as defined by
Prologis

, to exclude the following recurring and non-recurring items that we recognized directly or our share recognized by our unconsolidated entities to the extent they are included in

FFO, as defined by Prologis

:

(i)

gains or losses from acquisition, contribution or sale of land or development properties;

(ii)

income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate;

(iii)

impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate (either directly or through our investments in unconsolidated entities) generally as a result of
our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;

(iv)

impairment charges of goodwill and other assets;

(v)

gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt;

(vi)

merger, acquisition and other integration expenses; and

(vii)

expenses related to natural disasters.

We
believe it is appropriate to further adjust our

FFO, as defined by Prologis

for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets, rather than factors specific
to the on-going operating performance of our properties or investments. The impairment charges we recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate, which had declined due to market conditions, that we no longer expected to hold for
long-term investment. We currently have and have had over the past several years a stated priority to strengthen our financial position. We expect to accomplish this by reducing our debt, our investment in certain low yielding assets, such as land
that we decide not to develop and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. As a result, we have sold to third parties or contributed to unconsolidated entities real estate properties that, depending on market conditions, might result
in a gain or loss. The impairment charges related to goodwill and other assets that we have recognized were similarly caused by the decline in the real estate markets. Also in connection with our stated priority to reduce debt and extend debt
maturities, we have purchased portions of our debt securities. As a result, we recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time.

We have also adjusted for some non-recurring items. The merger, acquisition and other integration expenses include costs we incurred in 2011 and 2012
associated with the Merger and PEPR Acquisition and the integration of our systems and processes. We have not adjusted for the



acquisition costs that we have incurred as a result of routine acquisitions but only the costs associated with significant business combinations that we would expect to be infrequent in nature.
Similarly, the expenses related to the natural disaster in Japan that we recognized in 2011 are a rare occurrence but we may incur similar expenses again in the future.

We analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental income of our real estate and the revenue driven by our private capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This
income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities. As a result, although these items have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial
statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long-term.

We use

Core FFO

, including by segment and region, to: (i) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods,
relative to resource allocation decisions; (ii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (iv) provide guidance to the financial markets to
understand our expected operating performance; (v) assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future
results. Because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long-term outlook, we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long-term performance of the properties we own. As
noted above, we believe the long-term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income. We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of
our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy.

Limitations on Use of
our FFO Measures

While we believe our defined FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT’s nor our measures of
FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, they are two of many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some
of these limitations are:

•

The current income tax expenses that are excluded from our defined FFO measures represent the taxes that are payable.

•

Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash
requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Further, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of industrial properties are not reflected in
FFO.

•

Gains or losses from property acquisitions and dispositions or impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in the value of
the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of acquired or disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.

•

The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our defined FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset
or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our defined FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.

•

The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our defined FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign
currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period
changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.

•

The impairment charges of goodwill and other assets that we exclude from Core FFO, have been or may be realized as a loss in the future upon the
ultimate disposition of the related investments or other assets through the form of lower cash proceeds.

•

The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our debt at
less or more than our future obligation.

•

The Merger, acquisition and other integration expenses and the natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred.



We compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed
under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our defined FFO measures to our
net earnings computed under GAAP for the years ended December 31 as follows (in thousands).

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign-exchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments. We have
used certain derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency put option and forward contracts, to reduce our foreign currency market risk, as we deem appropriate. We have also used interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest
rate market risk. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with established policies and procedures.

We monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year
end interest rates. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below. The sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value. As a result, our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period, hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates. The failure to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rate
changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.

Interest Rate Risk

Our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. To achieve this objective, we
primarily borrow on a fixed rate basis for longer-term debt issuances. As of December 31, 2012, we had a total of $3.3 billion of variable rate debt outstanding, of which $0.9 billion was outstanding on our credit facilities, $0.6 billion was
outstanding under a multi-currency senior term loan and $1.8 billion was outstanding secured mortgage debt. As of December 31, 2012, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix $1.3 billion of our variable rate secured mortgage
debt.

Our primary interest rate risk not subject to interest rate swap agreements is created by the variable rate credit facilities, senior
term loan and selected secured mortgage debt. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of $1.2 billion on our variable rate debt not subject to interest rate swap agreements. Based on the
results of a sensitivity analysis assuming a 10% adverse change in interest rates based on our outstanding balances during the period, the impact was $2.0 million, which equates to a change in interest rates of 17 basis points.



Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to the translation of the net income and net investment of our foreign subsidiaries into
U.S. dollar, principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen, especially to the extent we wish to repatriate funds to the United States. To mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure, we borrow in the functional currency of the
borrowing entity, when appropriate. We also may use foreign currency put option contracts or other forms of hedging instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income or net equity of our
foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities. Hedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of
the foreign currency. The funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of foreign currency. The failure to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rate changes may
materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We may experience fluctuations in our earnings as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In fourth quarter 2012, we entered into foreign currency
forward contracts that expire in April 2013 with an aggregate notional amount of €1.0 billion ($1.3 billion using the forward rate of 1.30) to further hedge a portion of our investment in Europe at a fixed euro rate in U.S. dollars. Based on a
sensitivity analysis, a strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro by 10% would result in a $130.0 million positive or negative change, respectively, in our cash flows upon settlement of the forward contract. These derivatives
were designated and qualify as hedging instruments and therefore the changes in fair value of these derivatives will be recorded in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We may enter into similar agreements
in the future to further hedge our investment in Europe or other jurisdictions.

We also have some exposure to movements in exchange rates
related to certain intercompany loans we issue from time to time and we may use foreign currency forward contracts to manage these risks. At December 31, 2012, we had no forward contracts outstanding and, therefore, we may experience
fluctuations in our earnings from the remeasurement of these intercompany loans due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures

Controls and Procedures (Prologis, Inc.)

Prologis, Inc. carried out an evaluation under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as
of December 31, 2012. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Subsequent to December 31, 2012, there were no significant changes in the
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal
control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2012, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting was conducted as of December 31, 2012 based on the criteria described in “Internal Control — Integrated
Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2012, the internal control over financial reporting was effective.



Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.

Limitations of the
Effectiveness of Controls

Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of the internal control over financial
reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. The internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We have audited Prologis, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting

Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Prologis, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Description of Business

On June 3, 2011, AMB Property Corporation (“AMB”) and AMB Property, L.P. completed the merger contemplated by the
Agreement and Plan of Merger with ProLogis, a Maryland real estate investment trust (“ProLogis”) and its subsidiaries (the “Merger”). Following the Merger, AMB changed its name to Prologis, Inc. (the “REIT”). As a
result of the Merger, each outstanding common share of beneficial interest of ProLogis was converted into 0.4464 of a newly issued share of common stock of the REIT. As further discussed in Note 3, AMB was the legal acquirer and ProLogis was the
accounting acquirer. As such, in the Consolidated Financial Statements the historical results of ProLogis were included for the pre-Merger period and the combined results were included subsequent to the Merger. See Note 3 for further discussion on
the Merger.

Prologis, Inc. commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997, elected to be taxed as a real estate
investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Internal Revenue Code”), and believes the current organization and method of operation will enable the REIT to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust.
The REIT is the general partner of Prologis, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”). Through our controlling interest in the Operating Partnership, we are engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development and operation of industrial
properties in global, regional and other distribution markets throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our current business strategy includes two reportable business segments: Real Estate Operations and Private Capital. Our Real Estate Operations
segment represents the long-term ownership of industrial properties. Our Private Capital segment represents the long-term management of co-investment ventures and other unconsolidated entities. See Note 22 for further discussion of our business
segments. Unless otherwise indicated, the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both the REIT and the Operating Partnership. The terms “the Company,” “Prologis,” “we,” “our” or “us”
means the REIT and Operating Partnership collectively.

As of December 31, 2012, the REIT owned an approximate 99.59% general partnership
interest in the Operating Partnership, and 100% of the preferred units. The remaining approximate 0.41% common limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of the REIT. As
the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the REIT has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Operating Partnership. We operate the REIT and the Operating Partnership
as one enterprise. The management of the REIT consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. These members are officers of the REIT and employees of the Operating Partnership or one of its direct or indirect
subsidiaries. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the REIT consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the REIT does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating
Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the REIT and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in our
reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. All material intercompany transactions with consolidated entities have been eliminated.

We
consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the
entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts
the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity.

For
entities that are not defined as variable interest entities, we first consider whether Prologis is the general partner or the limited partner (or the equivalent in such investments which are not structured as partnerships). We consolidate entities
in which we are the general partner and the limited partners in such investments do not have rights which would preclude control. For entities in which we are the general partner but do not control the entity as the other partners hold substantive
participating rights and/or kick-out rights, the equity method of accounting is applied. For joint ventures for which we are the limited partner, we consider factors such as ownership interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and
contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners to determine if the presumption that the general partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances where the factors indicate that we control the joint venture, we consolidate the
entity.

Adjustments and Reclassifications.

Rental recoveries, included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and
cash used for real estate acquisition investing activities, included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2011 and 2010 have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 financial statement presentation. In addition, certain other amounts
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for 2011 and 2010 have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 financial statement presentation.

Use of Estimates.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). GAAP
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we made are reasonable and appropriate, as discussed in the applicable sections throughout these Consolidated Financial
Statements, different



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported results. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions and
future changes in market conditions could impact our future operating results.

Foreign Operations.

The U.S. dollar is
the functional currency for our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities operating in the United States and Mexico and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries that operate as holding companies for foreign investments. The functional
currency for our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities operating in countries other than the United States and Mexico is the principal currency in which the entity’s assets, liabilities, income and expenses are denominated,
which may be different from the local currency of the country of incorporation or the country where the entity conducts its operations.

The
functional currencies of our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities generally include the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, and Singapore dollar. We are parties to business
transactions denominated in these and other currencies.

For our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
U.S. dollar, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries’ financial statements. Generally, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the
balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are included in the

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain balance sheet items, primarily equity and capital-related accounts, are reflected
at the historical exchange rate. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period and income statement accounts that represent significant non-recurring transactions are translated at the rate in effect as of
the date of the transaction. We translate our share of the net earnings or losses of our unconsolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar at the average exchange rate for the period.

We and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany and third party debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional currency.
When the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity, a gain or loss can result. The resulting adjustment is reflected in results of operations, unless it is intercompany debt that is deemed to be long-term in nature and then
the adjustment is reflected in equity. The remeasurement results in the recognition of a cumulative translation adjustment in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

.

We are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between certain foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of the foreign
currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment would have an effect on our reported results of operations and financial position. Although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements
denominated in the same functional currency as the investment and, on occasion and when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative contracts, there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful.

Business Combinations.

When we acquire a business, which includes an operating property, we record the acquisition at
“full fair value”. Transaction costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred. The transaction costs related to the acquisition of land and equity method investments continue to be capitalized, as these are not
considered to be business combinations.

When we acquire a business or individual operating properties, with the intention to hold the
investment for the long-term

,

we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on
management’s preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one
year. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. A gain may be recognized to the extent the purchase price is less than the fair value of net
tangible and intangible assets acquired.

When we obtain control of an unconsolidated entity, we account for the acquisition of the entity in
accordance with the guidance for a business combination achieved in stages. We measure our previously held interest in the unconsolidated entity at its acquisition-date fair value and recognize the resulting gain or loss, if any, in earnings at the
acquisition date.

We allocate the purchase price using primarily level 2 and level 3 inputs (further defined in Fair Value Measurements) as
follows:

Investments in Real Estate Properties.

Industrial operating properties are valued as if vacant

.

We estimate fair value
generally by applying an income approach methodology using a discounted cash flow analysis. Key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis include origination costs and discount and capitalization rates. Discount and capitalization rates are
determined by market based on recent appraisals, transactions, and other market data. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are
currently being offered on the market for sale.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities.

We estimate the fair value of the entity by
using similar valuation methods as those used for consolidated real estate properties and debt. We multiply the estimated net asset value of the entity by our ownership percentage to estimate the fair value of our investment.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Intangible Assets.

We determine the portion of the purchase price related to intangible assets,
as follows:

•

In Place Leases.

The fair value of in place leases is calculated based upon our estimate of the costs to obtain tenants, primarily leasing
commissions, in each of the applicable markets. The value is recorded in other assets and amortized over the average remaining estimated life of the lease to amortization expense.

•

Above and Below Market Leases.

An asset or liability is recognized for acquired leases with favorable or unfavorable rents based on our estimate
of current market rents in each of the applicable markets. The value is recorded in either other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, and is amortized over the average remaining estimated life of the lease and charged to rental income.

•

Management Contracts.

The recognition of value of existing investment management agreements is calculated by discounting future expected cash
flows under the agreements. The value is recorded in other assets and amortized over the remaining term of the contract to amortization expense.

Debt.

The fair value of debt is estimated based on contractual future cash flows discounted using borrowing spreads and market interest rates that would be available to us for the issuance of debt
with similar terms and remaining maturities. In the case of publicly traded debt, the fair value is estimated based on available market data. Any discount or premium to the principal amount is included in the carrying value and amortized over the
remaining term of the related debt using the effective interest method to interest expense.

Noncontrolling Interest.

We estimate the
portion of the fair value of the net assets owned by third parties based on the fair value of the consolidated real estate properties and debt.

Working Capital

. The fair value of all other assumed assets and liabilities is based on the best information available.

Fair Value Measurements.

The objective of fair value is to determine the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). We estimate fair value using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these
purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that we would realize upon disposition. The fair value hierarchy consists
of three broad levels:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the
assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

Long-Lived Assets.

Real Estate Assets.

Real estate assets are carried
at depreciated cost. Costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets are capitalized as part of the investment basis of the real estate assets. Costs incurred in acquiring real estate properties and making
repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred.

During the land development and construction periods of qualifying
projects, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and general and administrative costs of the personnel performing the development, renovation, and rehabilitation; if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific
activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets. When a municipal district finances costs we incur for public infrastructure improvements, we record the costs in real
estate until we are reimbursed or we credit the reimbursement to our tenants through real estate taxes. We capitalize costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that results directly from and are essential to acquire that lease, including
internal costs that are incremental and identifiable as leasing activities. Leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of other assets.

The depreciable portions of real estate assets are charged to depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Depreciation commences at the earlier of
stabilization (defined as 90% occupied) or one year after completion of construction. We generally use the following useful lives: 5 to 7 years for capital improvements, 10 years for standard tenant improvements, 25 years for
depreciable land improvements on developed buildings, 30 years for operating properties acquired and 40 years for operating properties we develop. Investments that are located on tarmac, which is land owned by federal, state or local
airport authorities, and subject to ground leases are depreciated over the shorter of the investment life or the contractual term of the underlying ground lease. Capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the estimated remaining lease term. Our
weighted average lease term based on square feet for all leases in effect at December 31, 2012 was seven years.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

We assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of the assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to
review our assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques; including discounted cash flow
models; quoted market values; and third party appraisals, where considered necessary. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge
for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.

We estimate the future
undiscounted cash flows based on our intent as follows:

(i)

for real estate properties that we intend to hold long-term; including land held for development, properties currently under development and operating buildings;
recoverability is assessed based on the estimated future net rental income from operating the property and the terminal value;

(ii)

for land parcels we intend to sell, recoverability is assessed based on estimated fair value;

(iii)

for real estate properties currently under development and operating buildings we intend to sell, recoverability is assessed based on proceeds from disposition that are
estimated based on future net rental income of the property and expected market capitalization rates; and

(iv)

for costs incurred related to the potential acquisition of land or development of a real estate property, recoverability is assessed based on the probability that the
acquisition or development is likely to occur as of the measurement date.

The use of projected future cash flows is based on
assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. However, assumptions and estimates about future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are
complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions and our ultimate investment intent that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties or
the recognition of a gain or loss at time of disposal.

Goodwill.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We perform an annual impairment test for goodwill at the reporting unit level. We have $25.3 million of goodwill associated with our Private Capital segment in
Europe. We perform an annual review of recoverability during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.

Discontinued operations represent a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the
operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the
component after the disposal transaction. The results of operations of a component of our business or properties that have been classified as discontinued operations are also reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. We classify
a component of our business or property as held for sale when certain criteria are met, which are in accordance with GAAP. At such time, the respective assets and liabilities are presented separately on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and
depreciation is no longer recognized. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value less the costs to sell the assets.

Assets held for sale and properties disposed of are considered discontinued operations if sold to a third party. Properties contributed or sold to entities in which we maintain an ownership interest, act
as manager or account for under the equity method are not considered discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement with the properties.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities.

Our investments in certain entities are presented under the equity method. The equity method is used when we have the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies of the venture but do not have control of the entity. Under the equity method, these investments (including advances) are initially recognized in the balance sheet at our cost and are
subsequently adjusted to reflect our proportionate share of net earnings or losses, distributions received, deferred gains from the contribution of properties and certain other adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there may have
been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If we conclude it is other than temporary we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at fair value.

Notes Receivable Backed by Real Estate.

We hold certain investments in debt securities that are backed by real estate assets. We
regularly review the creditworthiness of the entities with which we hold the note agreements and reduce the notes receivable balance by estimating an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The notes are also evaluated
individually for impairment. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

We consider all cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions, and short-term highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are financial instruments



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We invest our cash with high-credit quality institutions. Cash balances may be invested in money market accounts that are not insured. We have
not realized any losses in such cash investments or accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk.

Restricted Cash

.

Restricted cash consists primarily of escrows under secured mortgage agreements for taxes, insurance and certain
other reserve requirements relating to the underlying collateral. In certain circumstances, the lender retains control over cash received for rental income for a period of three to six months prior to releasing it to us.

Financial Instruments.

We may use certain types of derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing certain foreign
currency exchange rate and interest rate risk. We reflect our derivative financial instruments at fair value and record changes in the fair value of these derivatives each period in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. To
qualify for hedge accounting treatment, generally the derivative instruments used for risk management purposes must effectively reduce the risk exposure that they are designed to hedge (primarily interest rate swaps and net investment hedges) and,
if a derivative instrument is utilized to hedge an anticipated transaction, the anticipated transaction must be probable of occurring. Derivative instruments meeting these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the
contract or at the redesignation process, if applicable.

The unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of an effective
hedge are recorded in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

for the REIT and

Partners’ Capital

for the Operating Partnership. For hedges related to debt, these amounts are amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the hedged
items. Changes in fair value of a net investment hedge remain in equity until the investment is substantially liquidated. The ineffective portion of a hedge, if any, is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of the
derivative instrument does not perfectly offset the change in value of the item being hedged. We estimate the fair value of our financial instruments through a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing
at each balance sheet date. Primarily, we use quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments. These values represent a general approximation of possible value and may never actually be realized.

Exchangeable Debt.

For the convertible notes we issued in 2008 and 2007, we were required to separate the accounting for
the debt and equity components as we have the ability to settle the conversion of the debt and conversion spread, at our option, in cash, common stock, or a combination of cash and stock. The liability and equity components of convertible debt are
accounted for separately. The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value at the date of issuance of a similar bond without the conversion feature, which results in the debt being recorded at a discount. The resulting debt
discount is amortized over the estimated remaining life of the debt as additional non-cash interest expense. The carrying amount of the equity component is determined by deducting the fair value of the debt component from the initial proceeds of the
convertible debt instrument as a whole. Under the terms of the issuance of the 2010 convertible notes, we were required to settle the conversion by issuance of common shares and therefore this accounting did not apply to these notes.

In connection with the Merger and the debt exchange offer in June 2011, all issuances of our convertible notes became exchangeable notes issued by the
Operating Partnership that are exchangeable into common stock of the REIT. As a result, the accounting for the exchangeable senior notes now requires us to separate the fair value of the derivative instrument (exchange feature) from the debt
instrument and account for it separately as a derivative. At each reporting period, we adjust the derivative instrument to fair value with the adjustment being recorded in earnings as

Foreign Currency Exchange and Derivative Gains (Losses),
Net

. We continue to amortize the discount over the remaining term of the exchangeable notes.

Noncontrolling
Interests.

We recognize the noncontrolling interests in entities that we consolidate but of which we do not own 100% by using each noncontrolling holder’s respective share of the estimated fair value of the net assets as of the
date of formation or acquisition. Noncontrolling interest that was created or assumed as a part of a business combination is recognized at fair value as of the date of the transaction. Noncontrolling interest is subsequently adjusted for additional
contributions, distributions to noncontrolling holders and the noncontrolling holders’ proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each respective entity.

Certain limited partnership interests issued by us in connection with the formation of a real estate partnership and as consideration in a business combination are exchangeable into our common stock.
Common stock issued upon exchange of a holder’s noncontrolling interest is accounted for at our carrying value of the surrendered noncontrolling interest.

Costs of Raising Capital.

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of both common stock and preferred stock are treated as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Costs
incurred in connection with the issuance or renewal of debt are capitalized in other assets, and amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

. For the REIT, we include

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. For the Operating Partnership,

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

is included in partners’ capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any reference to

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

in this document is
referring to the component of stockholders’ equity for the REIT and partners’ capital for the Operating Partnership.

Revenue
Recognition.

Rental Income.

We lease our operating properties to customers under agreements that are classified as
operating leases. We recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, under the terms of our leases,



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

the majority of our rental expenses are recovered from our customers. We reflect amounts recovered from customers as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses are incurred. A provision
for possible loss is made if the collection of a receivable balance is considered doubtful.

Private Capital Revenue.

Private capital
revenue includes revenues we earn from the management services we provide to unconsolidated entities and certain third parties. These fees are recognized as earned and in accordance with the terms specific to each arrangement and may include
property and asset management fees or transactional fees for leasing, acquisition, construction, financing, legal and tax services provided. We may also earn promote payments based on third party investor returns over time. We recognize these fees
when earned, fixed and determinable.

Gains on Disposition of Real Estate.

Gains on the disposition of real estate are recorded
when the recognition criteria have been met, generally at the time the risks and rewards and title have transferred and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold. Losses from the disposition of real estate are
recognized when known.

When we contribute or sell a property to an unconsolidated entity in which we have an ownership interest, we do not
recognize a portion of the gain realized. If a loss is realized it is recognized when known. The amount of gain not recognized, based on our ownership interest in the entity acquiring the property, is deferred by recognizing a reduction to our
investment in the applicable unconsolidated entity. We adjust our proportionate share of net earnings or losses recognized in future periods to reflect the entities’ recorded depreciation expense as if it were computed on our lower basis in the
contributed properties rather than on the entity’s basis.

When a property that we originally contributed to an unconsolidated entity is
disposed of to a third party, we recognize the amount of the gain we had previously deferred, along with our proportionate share of the gain recognized by the entity. During periods when our ownership interest in an unconsolidated entity decreases
and the decrease is expected to be permanent, we recognize the amounts relating to previously deferred gains to coincide with our new ownership interest.

Rental Expenses.

Rental expenses primarily include the cost of our property management personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, property insurance and real estate taxes.

Private Capital Expenses.

These costs include the property management expenses associated with the property-level
management of the properties owned by our unconsolidated entities and the direct expenses associated with the asset management of the unconsolidated entities.

Stock-Based Compensation.

We account for stock-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the fair
value of the award on the grant date. We recognize the cost of the entire award on a straight-lined basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, generally the vesting period.

Income Taxes.

Prologis, Inc. commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997, elected to be taxed as a real
estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, and believes the current organization and method of operation will enable the REIT to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust. Under the Internal Revenue Code, real estate
investment trusts are generally not required to pay federal income taxes if they distribute 100% of their taxable income and meet certain income, asset and stockholder tests. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable
year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a real estate investment trust for the four subsequent taxable years. Even as a real estate
investment trust, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our own income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.

We have elected taxable real estate investment trust subsidiary (“TRS”) status for some of our consolidated subsidiaries. This allows us to provide services that would otherwise be considered
impermissible for real estate investment trusts. Many of the foreign countries in which we have operations do not recognize real estate investment trusts or do not accord real estate investment trust status under their respective tax laws to our
entities that operate in their jurisdiction. In the United States, we are taxed in certain states in which we operate. Accordingly, we recognize income tax expense for the federal and state income taxes incurred by our TRSs, taxes incurred in
certain states and foreign jurisdictions, and interest and penalties associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities.

We evaluate tax
positions taken in the financial statements on a quarterly basis under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is
“more-likely-than-not” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.

Deferred income taxes are
recognized in certain taxable entities. Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes) and the utilization of tax net
operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets. A valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets is provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not
be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances that causes a change in the estimated realizability of the related deferred income tax asset is included in deferred tax expense.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Environmental Costs.

We incur certain environmental remediation costs, including
cleanup costs, consulting fees for environmental studies and investigations, monitoring costs, and legal costs relating to cleanup, litigation defense, and the pursuit of responsible third parties. Costs incurred in connection with operating
properties and properties previously sold are expensed. Costs related to undeveloped land are capitalized as development costs. Costs incurred for properties to be disposed are included in the cost of the properties upon disposition. We maintain a
liability for the estimated costs of environmental remediation expected to be incurred in connection with undeveloped land, operating properties and properties previously sold that we adjust as appropriate as information becomes available.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards.

In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to amend and simplify
the rules related to testing goodwill for impairment. The update allows an entity to make an initial qualitative evaluation, based on the entity’s events and circumstances, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of
a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The results of this qualitative assessment determine whether it is necessary to perform the currently required two-step impairment test. The new guidance was effective for us on January 1, 2012
for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed. We adopted this standard and it did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as part of the changes in stockholders’
equity, and requires the presentation of components of net income and other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2012 and it was
effective on a retrospective basis. As this standard is for presentation purposes only, it had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to amend the requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in order to achieve
further convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2012. See Note 20 for additional disclosures.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards.

In February 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires disclosure of the effect of significant reclassifications out of
accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income. The disclosure requirements are effective for us on January 1, 2013, and we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In January 2013, a final consensus was reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) and ratified by the FASB on
the accounting for currency translation adjustment (“CTA”) when a parent sells or transfers part of its ownership interest in a foreign subsidiary. When a company sells a subsidiary or group of assets that constitute a business while
maintaining ownership of the foreign entity in which those assets or subsidiary reside, a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity is required in order for a parent entity to release CTA to earnings. However, for a
company that sells all or part of its ownership interest in a foreign entity, CTA is released upon the loss of a controlling financial interest in a consolidated foreign entity or partial sale of an equity method investment in a foreign entity. The
guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2014, and we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires disclosures about offsetting and related arrangements to enable financial statements users to evaluate the effect or potential
effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position, including rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the guidance applies only to
derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transaction that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria under GAAP or subject to a master netting arrangement or
similar agreement. The disclosure requirements are effective for us on January 1, 2013, and we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to clarify the scope of current U.S. GAAP. The update clarifies that the real estate sales
guidance applies to the derecognition of in-substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary’s nonrecourse debt. That is, even if the reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest under the consolidation
guidance, the reporting entity would continue to include the real estate, debt, and the results of the subsidiary’s operations in its consolidated financial statements until legal title to the real estate is transferred to legally satisfy the
debt. This accounting standard update is effective for us on January 1, 2013, and we do not expect the guidance to impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Combinations

Merger of AMB and ProLogis

As discussed in Note 1, we completed the Merger on June 3, 2011. After consideration of all applicable factors pursuant to the business combination accounting rules, the Merger resulted in a reverse
acquisition in which AMB was the “legal acquirer” because AMB issued its common stock to ProLogis shareholders and ProLogis was the “accounting acquirer” due to various factors, including the fact that ProLogis shareholders held
the largest portion of the voting rights in the merged entity and ProLogis appointees represented the majority of the Board of Directors (“Board”). In our Consolidated Financial Statements, the period ended December 31, 2011 includes
the historical results of ProLogis for the entire period presented, and the results of the merged company are included subsequent to the Merger.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

As ProLogis was the accounting acquirer, the calculation of the purchase price for accounting purposes
is based on the price of ProLogis common shares and common shares ProLogis would have had to issue to achieve a similar ownership split between AMB stockholders and ProLogis shareholders. We estimated the fair value of the pre-combination portion of
AMB’s share-based payment awards based on market data and, in the case of stock options, we used a Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of these awards as of the Merger date. An adjustment was made to equity for the vested portion
while the unvested portion will be expensed over the remaining service period. The purchase price allocation reflects aggregate consideration of approximately $5.9 billion, as calculated below (in millions, except price per share):

The allocation of the purchase price requires a significant amount of judgment. The allocation was based on our valuation,
estimates and assumptions of the acquisition date fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. The purchase price allocation is complete and adjustments recorded during the one year measurement period were not
considered to be material to our financial position or results of operations. The allocation of the purchase price was as follows (in millions):

Acquisition of ProLogis European Properties

During the second quarter of 2011, we increased our ownership of ProLogis European Properties (“PEPR”) through open market purchases and a mandatory tender offer. In May 2011, we settled our
mandatory tender offer that resulted in the acquisition of an additional 96.5 million ordinary units and 2.7 million convertible preferred units of PEPR. During all of the second quarter of 2011, we made aggregate cash purchases totaling
€715.8 million ($1.0 billion). We funded the purchases through borrowings under our global line of credit and a new €500 million bridge facility, which was subsequently repaid with proceeds from an equity offering in June 2011.

Upon completion of the tender offer, we met the requirements to consolidate PEPR. In accordance with the accounting rules for business
combinations, we marked our equity investment in PEPR from its carrying value to fair value of approximately €486 million, which resulted in the recognition of a gain of €59.6 million ($85.9 million). We refer to this transaction
as the “PEPR Acquisition”. The fair value was based on the trading price for our previously owned units and our acquisition price for the PEPR units purchased during the tender offer period.

We have allocated the aggregate purchase price, representing the share of PEPR we owned at the time of consolidation of €1.1 billion ($1.6 billion).
The allocation of the purchase price required a significant amount of judgment and was based on our valuation, estimates and assumptions of the acquisition date fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. The purchase

Pro forma Information (unaudited)

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents our results as though the Merger and the PEPR Acquisition, as well as the equity offering in June 2011 that was used, in part, to repay the
loans used to fund the PEPR Acquisition, had been consummated as of January 1, 2010. The pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the actual results of operations had the transactions been consummated at the beginning of the period
indicated nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results. The pro forma information does not give effect to any cost synergies or other operating efficiencies that have resulted or could result from the Merger and also does not include
any merger and integration expenses. The results for the year ended December 31, 2011 included approximately seven months of actual results for both the Merger and PEPR Acquisition, and pro forma adjustments for five months. Actual results in
2011 include rental income and rental expenses of the properties acquired through the Merger and PEPR Acquisition of $575.2 million and $154.4 million, respectively, of which $50.5 million of rental income and $11.9 million of rental expenses are
included in discontinued operations.

These results include certain adjustments, primarily decreased revenues resulting from the amortization of the net asset
from the acquired leases with favorable or unfavorable rents relative to estimated market rents, increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the adjustment of real estate assets to estimated fair value and recognition of
intangible assets related to in-place leases and acquired management contracts and lower interest expense due to the accretion of the fair value adjustment of debt.

Acquisitions of Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures

On February 3, 2012, we
acquired our partner’s 63% interest in and now own 100% of our previously unconsolidated co-investment venture Prologis North American Industrial Fund II (“NAIF II”) and we repaid the loan from NAIF II to our partner for a total of
$336.1 million. The assets and liabilities of this venture, as well as the activity since the acquisition date, have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with the accounting rules for business combinations, we marked
our equity investment in NAIF II from its carrying value to the estimated fair value. The fair value was determined and allocated based on our valuation, estimates, and assumptions of the acquisition date fair value of the tangible and intangible
assets and liabilities. The preliminary allocation of net assets acquired is approximately $1.6 billion in real estate assets, $27.3 million of net other assets and $875.4 million in debt. We have not recorded a gain or loss with this transaction,
as the carrying value of our investment was equal to the estimated fair value. While the current allocation of the purchase price is substantially complete, the valuation of the real estate properties is being finalized. We do not expect future
revisions, if any, to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

On February 22, 2012, we dissolved
the unconsolidated co-investment venture Prologis California and divided the portfolio equally with our partner. The net value of the assets and liabilities distributed represented the fair value of our ownership interest in the co-investment
venture on that date. In accordance with the accounting rules for business combinations, we marked our equity investment in Prologis California from its carrying value to the estimated fair value which resulted in a gain of $273.0 million. The gain
is recorded in

Gains on Acquisitions and Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net

in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value was determined and allocated based on our valuation, estimates, and assumptions of the
acquisition date fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. The preliminary allocation of net assets acquired is approximately $496.3 million in real estate assets, $17.7 million of net other assets and $150.0 million in debt.
While the current allocation of the purchase price is substantially complete, the valuation of the real estate properties is being finalized. We do not expect future revisions, if any, to have a significant impact on our financial position or
results of operations.

On November 30, 2012, Prologis North American Properties Fund 1 (“Fund 1”) distributed real estate
properties based on fair value to our partner. We acquired the remaining interest in Fund 1 for total consideration of $33.2 million. In accordance with the accounting rules for business combinations, we marked our equity investment in Fund 1 from
its carrying value to the estimated fair value which resulted in a gain of $21.2 million. The gain is recorded in

Gains on Acquisitions and Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair
value was determined and allocated based on our valuation, estimates, and assumptions of the acquisition date fair value, which consisted primarily of real estate and intangible assets of $117.0 million. While the current allocation of the purchase
price is substantially complete, the valuation of the real estate properties is being finalized. We do not expect future revisions, if any, to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

We refer to these three transactions collectively as “Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions”. Our results for 2012 include rental income and rental
expenses of the properties acquired in the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions of $170.6 million and $42.5 million, respectively, of which $4.9 million of rental income and $0.9 million of rental expenses are included in discontinued operations.

Dispositions

During 2012, we disposed of land, land subject to ground leases and 200 operating properties to third parties aggregating
27.2 million square feet, resulting in net proceeds of $1.7 billion and net gains of $83.2 million ($17.3 million in continuing operations and $65.9 million in discontinued operations).

mixed-use projects with related land and development agreements, two residential development joint ventures, a railway station and certain ground leases. In 2010, we recognized an impairment charge of $168.8 million related to this transaction and a
gain of $4.4 million in 2011 when the sale of these assets was completed.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we sold a portfolio of industrial
properties and several equity method investments for gross proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion resulting in a net gain of $203.1 million ($66.1 million loss in continuing operations and $269.2 million gain in discontinued operations). The
industrial portfolio included 182 properties aggregating 23 million square feet and the equity method investments included our 20% ownership interest in three co-investment ventures (ProLogis North American Properties Fund VI-VIII) and an
investment in one of our other unconsolidated joint ventures that owned a hotel property.

(4)

We have one partner in each of these co-investment ventures.

(5)

We have an ownership interest in this co-investment venture along with numerous third party investors. During 2012, this venture disposed of nine properties for a gain

On December 20, 2012 we announced the signing of a definitive agreement for the formation of Prologis European Logistics Partners (“PELP”) with
Norges Bank Investment Management (“NBIM”). We will have a 50% ownership interest in PELP that we will account for under the equity method of accounting. NBIM will have equity commitments of €1.2 billion ($1.6 billion). The venture
has an initial term of 15 years, which may be extended for an additional 15 year period. Prologis will have the ability to reduce its ownership to 20% following the second anniversary of closing. Upon the closing of PELP (which is expected to be in
the first quarter of 2013), the venture will acquire 195 operating properties from us. In connection with the signing of the transaction, NBIM received a warrant to acquire six million shares of Prologis common stock with a strike price of $35.64,
which we expect to become exercisable upon closing of the transaction.

On February 14, 2013, we formed a new co-investment venture in Japan in
which we contributed twelve properties for an aggregate purchase price of ¥173 billion ($1.9 billion). See Note 25 for more details.

The
following is summarized financial information of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures and our investment (dollars in millions). The co-investment venture information represents 100% of Prologis’ stepped up basis, not our proportionate
share, and may not be comparable to values reflected in the entities’ stand alone financial statements calculated on a different basis.

(1)

During 2012, we concluded three of our co-investment ventures in the Americas whose results are included in both periods through the transaction date
(see Note 3 for further details). Amounts presented for 2011 reflect the acquisition of seven ventures in the Merger,



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

offset by PEPR, which is now consolidated. Amounts include approximately seven months of activity in 2011 from the investments acquired through the Merger and five months of activity for PEPR.

(2)

In 2012, five ventures in the Americas recorded net gains of $9.4 million from the disposition of 38 properties. During 2012, Prologis NAIII wrote off accumulated other
comprehensive loss due to the settlement of debt before maturity by transferring the secured properties to the lender in lieu of payment for $25.1 million (Prologis share was $5.0 million) and the settlement of interest rate swap agreements in which
the related debt is no longer expected to reach maturity for $21.5 million (Prologis share was $4.3 million).

Included in 2011 net earnings (loss) in Americas is a net gain of $17.1 million from the disposition of 21 properties by two ventures.
Also included in net earnings (loss) in Americas is a loss of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to the impairment of two operating buildings in two of the ventures. Included in the net earnings (loss) in Europe is a gain of
$6.4 million from the acquisition of a property by one of our co-investment ventures.

(3)

As of December 31, 2012, we had one note receivable from Prologis SGP Mexico of $19.7 million. As of December 31, 2011, we had notes receivable aggregating
$41.2 million from Prologis NAIII ($21.4 million) and Prologis SGP Mexico ($19.8 million). In February 2012, the note receivable to us and loan from Prologis North American Industrial Fund III payable to our partner were restructured into equity
according to our ownership percentages. The remaining amounts represent current balances from services provided by us to the venture.

(4)

As discussed in Note 3, debt was reduced by $1.4 billion related to the conclusion of three unconsolidated co-investment ventures during 2012. As of December 31,
2012 and 2011, we guaranteed $30.4 million and $28.0 million, respectively, of the third party debt of certain unconsolidated ventures. As of December 31, 2011, we had pledged properties included in our Real Estate Operations segment with
an undepreciated cost of approximately $277.0 million, to serve as additional collateral for the secured mortgage loan of NAIF II payable to an affiliate of our venture partner. In connection with the acquisition of our partner’s interest in
February 2012, we repaid this loan, and these assets are no longer pledged.

(5)

Represents our weighted average ownership interest in all co-investment ventures based on each entity’s contribution to total assets, before depreciation, net of
other liabilities.

(6)

The difference between our ownership interest of the venture’s equity and our investment balance results principally from three types of transactions:
(i) deferring a portion of the gains we recognize from a contribution of one of our properties to the venture (see next sub-footnote); (ii) recording additional costs associated with our investment in the venture; and (iii) advances
to the venture.

(7)

This amount is recorded as a reduction to our investment and represents the gains that were deferred when we contributed a property to a venture due to our continuing
ownership in the property.

Equity Commitments Related to Certain Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures

Certain unconsolidated co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. We may fulfill our equity commitment through
contributions of properties or cash. Our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. We are committed to offer to contribute certain properties that we develop and stabilize in select markets in Europe and Mexico to certain ventures.
These ventures are committed to acquire such properties, subject to certain exceptions, including that the properties meet certain specified leasing and other criteria, and that the ventures have available capital. We are not obligated to contribute
properties at a loss. Depending on market conditions, the investment objectives of the ventures and other factors, we may make contributions of properties to these ventures through the remaining commitment period.

The following table is a summary of remaining equity commitments as of December 31, 2012 (in millions):



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(1)

We secured $295.5 million in commitments from third parties in 2012 in order to fund future acquisitions from us and third parties that meet the venture’s
investment strategy, or to pay down existing debt. During 2012, the venture called capital of $265.5 million from these investors primarily to fund third party acquisitions.

(2)

These equity commitments will be called only if needed to pay outstanding debt of the venture. The relevant debt was due in 2012, which was automatically extended until
the third quarter of 2013. There is also an option to extend until the third quarter of 2014.

(3)

Equity commitments are denominated in euro and reported above in U.S. dollar. During 2012, this venture acquired two buildings from third parties with capital
previously called. Also during 2012, this venture called capital of €136.0 million ($178.6 million) of which €20.4 million ($26.8 million) represented our share to fund the contribution of nine buildings from us and the
acquisition of one building from a third party.

To the extent an unconsolidated entity acquires properties from a third party or
requires cash to retire debt or has other cash needs, we may be required or agree to contribute our proportionate share of the equity component in cash to the unconsolidated entity.

Other joint ventures

We have acquired several investments in other unconsolidated joint
ventures that own real estate properties and/or perform development activity. We recognized our proportionate share of the earnings from our investments in these entities and have summarized this information for the years ended December 31 as
follows (in thousands):

Our investments in and advances to these entities as of December 31 was as follows (in thousands):

(1)

The balance represents an investment in a preferred equity interest made in 2010 through a sale of a portfolio of industrial properties. Based on the
terms of this instrument, the preferred equity interest meets the definition of an investment in a debt security from an accounting perspective. We earn a preferred return at an annual rate of 7% for the first three years, 8% for the fourth year and
10%

thereafter until redeemed. Partial or full redemption can occur at any time at the buyer’s discretion or after the five year anniversary at our discretion.

(2)

The balance as of December 31, 2011 represented an investment in a preferred equity interest made in 2011 through a sale of a portfolio of retail, mixed-use and
other non-core assets. Based on the terms of this instrument, the preferred equity interest met the definition of an investment in a debt security from an accounting perspective. We earned a preferred return at an annual rate of 7%. In the fourth
quarter of 2012, we received a repayment of the outstanding balance.

(3)

The balance as of December 31, 2011 represented a loan to NAIF II secured by 12 buildings. In February 2012, we purchased the remaining interest in NAIF II. As a
result, we began consolidating this entity and eliminated this note receivable. See Note 3 for more detail on this transaction.

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

We had five land parcels and one operating property that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2012.
The amounts included in held for sale as of December 31, 2012 represented real estate investment balances and the related assets and liabilities for each property.

The operations of the properties held for sale or disposed of to third parties and the aggregate net gains or losses recognized upon their disposition are presented as

Debt

All debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The REIT itself does not have any indebtedness, but guarantees
the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership. We generally do not guarantee the debt issued by non-wholly owned subsidiaries.

Our debt
consisted of the following as of December 31 (dollars in thousands):

(1)

The interest rates represent the effective interest rates (including amortization of the non-cash premiums or discount).

(2)

Included in the outstanding balances are borrowings denominated in non-U.S. dollars: euro ($1.8 billion), Japanese yen ($2.1 billion) and British pound sterling ($0.2
billion).

(3)

As discussed in Note 13 in connection with the liquidation of PEPR in 2012, we acquired the remaining interest in PEPR’s assets and liabilities. As such, $1.4
billion was reclassified from debt of consolidated entities to $538.7 million of senior notes and $852.2 million of secured mortgage debt. Also, as part of the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions, we assumed $1.0 billion of secured mortgage debt.

(4)

Notes are due January 2013 to July 2020 and interest rates range from 2.3% to 9.3%.

(5)

Interest rates range from 3.3% to 5.9% and include the impact of amortization of the non-cash discount related to these notes. The weighted average coupon interest rate
was 2.8% and 2.6% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. See below for more detail on these notes.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(6)

Debt is due January 2013 to May 2025 and interest rates range from 0.8% to 7.6%. The debt is secured by 402 real estate properties with an aggregate undepreciated cost
of $7.6 billion at December 31, 2012.

(7)

Debt is due January 2013 to December 2027 and interest rates range from 1.9% to 8.3%. The debt is secured by 107 real estate properties with an aggregate undepreciated
cost of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2012.

(8)

The debt includes $17.6 million of assessment bonds and $639.6 million of corporate term loans with varying interest rates from 1.6% to 7.9% that are due May 2013 to
September 2033. The assessment bonds are issued by municipalities and guaranteed by us as a means of financing infrastructure and secured by assessments (similar to property taxes) on various underlying real estate properties with an aggregate
undepreciated cost of $864.3 million at December 31, 2012.

During 2011 and 2010, we repurchased certain senior and
exchangeable senior notes outstanding, and also repaid certain secured mortgage debt in Japan. The original principal amount of the debt activity during 2011 and 2010 was $894.5 million and $3.0 billion, respectively, creating a gain of less than
$1.0 million and a loss of $201.5 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Credit Facilities

We have a global senior credit facility (“Global Facility”), from which funds may be drawn in U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound
sterling and Canadian dollar on a revolving basis. The loans cannot exceed $1.7 billion (subject to currency fluctuations). We may increase the Global Facility to $2.7 billion, subject to currency fluctuations and obtaining additional lender
commitments. The Global Facility is scheduled to mature on June 3, 2015, but we may, at our option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee, extend the maturity date to June 3, 2016. Pricing
under the Global Facility, including the spread over LIBOR, facility fees and letter of credit fees, varies based upon the public debt ratings of the Operating Partnership. The Global Facility contains customary representations, covenants and
defaults (including a cross-acceleration to other recourse indebtedness of more than $50 million).

We also have a ¥36.5 billion
(approximately $424.0 million at December 31, 2012) Japanese yen revolver (the “Revolver”). The Revolver matures on March 1, 2014, but we may, at our option and subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions and payment of
an extension fee, extend the maturity date to February 27, 2015. We may increase availability under the Revolver to an amount not exceeding ¥56.5 billion (approximately $656.0 million at December 31, 2012) subject to
obtaining additional lender commitments. Pricing under the Revolver is consistent with the Global Facility pricing. The Revolver contains certain customary representations, covenants and defaults that are substantially the same as the corresponding
provisions of the Global Facility.

We refer to the Global Facility and the Revolver, collectively, as our “Credit Facilities”.

Commitments and availability under our Credit Facilities were as follows (dollars in millions):

Senior Notes

The senior unsecured notes are issued by the Operating Partnership and guaranteed by the REIT. Our obligations under the senior notes are effectively subordinated in certain respects to any of our debt
that is secured by a lien on real property, to the extent of the value of such real property. The senior notes require interest payments be made quarterly, semi-annually or annually. All of the senior and other notes are redeemable at any time at
our option, subject to certain prepayment penalties. Such redemption and other terms are governed by the provisions of indenture agreements, various note purchase agreements and a trust deed.

Exchangeable Senior Notes

On March 16, 2010, we issued $460.0 million of 3.3%
exchangeable senior notes maturing in 2015 (“2010 Exchangeable Notes”). The 2010 Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable at any time by holders at an initial conversion rate of 25.8244 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to
an initial conversion price of approximately $38.72 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash at any time on or prior to the
maturity date upon a

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

change in control or a termination of trading (each as defined in the notes). Due to the terms of the 2010 Exchangeable Notes, including that a conversion must be settled in common stock, the
accounting for these notes is different than the exchangeable senior notes we issued in 2007 and 2008. The 2010 Exchangeable Notes are reflected at the issuance amount and interest is recognized based on the stated coupon rate and the amortization
of the cash discount.

We also issued three series of exchangeable senior notes in 2007 and 2008 and refer to them collectively as the
“2007 and 2008 Exchangeable Notes”. The 2007 and 2008 Exchangeable Notes are senior obligations of Prologis and are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, for cash, our common stock or a combination of cash and our common stock, at our
option, at a conversion rate per $1,000 of principal amount of the notes of 5.8752 shares for the March 2007 issuance, 5.4874 shares for the November 2007 issuance and 5.8569 shares for the May 2008 issuance. The initial conversion
price ($170.21 for the March 2007 issuance, $182.24 for the November 2007 issuance and $170.74 for the May 2008 issuance) represented a premium of approximately 20% over the closing price of our common stock at the date of first sale and is subject
to adjustment under certain circumstances. The 2007 and 2008 Exchangeable Notes are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 and 2013, respectively, for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and at any time prior to maturity to the
extent necessary to preserve our status as a real estate investment trust. Holders of the 2007 and 2008 Exchangeable Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash on specific dates approximately every five years beginning in
2012 and 2013, respectively, and at any time prior to their maturity upon certain limited circumstances. Therefore, we have reflected these amounts in 2013 in the schedule of debt maturities below based on the first put date and we amortized the
discount through these dates.

In April 2012, we redeemed $448.9 million of the exchangeable notes that were issued in March 2007, which was
when the holders had the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash. In January 2013, we redeemed $141.4 million of the exchangeable notes issued in November 2007.

Interest expense related to our 2007 and 2008 exchangeable notes for the years ended December 31 included the following components (in thousands):

The unamortized discount at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $4.2 million and $22.6 million, respectively. The carrying
amount of the equity component is determined by deducting the fair value of the debt component from the initial proceeds of the exchangeable debt instrument as a whole. Additional paid-in capital under the conversion option was $381.5 million at
December 31, 2012 and 2011.

While we have the legal right to settle the conversion in either cash or stock, we intend to settle the
principal balance of the 2007 and 2008 Exchangeable Notes in cash. As stated above, the 2010 Exchangeable Notes are required to be settled in common stock. Based on current conversion rates, 2.8 million and 11.9 million shares would be
required to settle the principal amount in stock for the 2007 and 2008 Exchangeable Notes and the 2010 Exchangeable Notes, respectively. The conversion of the exchangeable notes into stock, and the corresponding adjustment to interest expense, are
included in our computation of diluted earnings per share/unit, unless the impact is anti-dilutive. During 2012, 2011, and 2010, the impact of these notes was anti-dilutive.

The exchangeable senior notes are issued by the Operating Partnership and are exchangeable into common stock of the REIT. The accounting for the exchangeable senior notes requires us to separate the fair
value of the derivative instrument (exchange feature) from the debt instrument and account for it separately as a derivative contract. We have determined that the exchangeable notes issued in 2010 are the only exchangeable notes where the fair value
of the derivative is not zero at December 31, 2012. At each reporting period, we adjust the derivative instrument to fair value with the resulting adjustment being recorded in earnings as

Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses), Net.

The fair value of the derivative associated with our exchangeable notes was a liability of $39.8 million and $17.5 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. We recognized an unrealized loss of $22.3 million and
an unrealized gain of $45.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Secured Mortgage Debt

TMK bonds are a financing vehicle in Japan for special purpose companies known as TMKs. In 2012, we issued ¥36.6 billion ($424.5
million as of December 31, 2012) of new TMK bonds with maturity dates ranging from December 2013 to May 2019 with interest rates ranging from 0.8% to 1.4% and secured by nine properties with an undepreciated cost at December 31, 2012 of
$767.3 million.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

In addition, in 2012, we amended our existing TMK bonds, increasing amounts outstanding by ¥12.4
billion ($144.5 million as of December 31, 2012). As a result, the range of maturities on these bonds changed from 2012 to 2014 to a range of December 2014 to April 2018, and the interest rates were reduced from a range of 1.8% to 4.0% to a
range of 1.0% to 1.8%.

In connection with the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions in 2012, along with one other land acquisition, we assumed
secured mortgage debt of $1.0 billion that is secured by land and 107 properties with a total undepreciated cost of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2012.

Other Debt

On February 2, 2012, we entered into a senior term loan agreement where we
may obtain loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed €487.5 million ($648.5 million at December 31, 2012). The loans can be obtained in U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and British pound sterling. We may increase the borrowings to
approximately €987.5 million ($1.3 billion at December 31, 2012), subject to obtaining additional lender commitments. The loan agreement is scheduled to mature on February 2, 2014, but we may extend the maturity date three times
at our option, in each case up to one year, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee. We fully drew the senior term loan and used the proceeds to pay off two term loans assumed in connection with the Merger and
the remainder to pay down borrowings on our Credit Facilities.

Debt Covenants

We have approximately $6.1 billion of senior notes and exchangeable senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2012. The senior notes were issued under two separate indentures, as supplemented, and
are subject to certain financial covenants. The exchangeable senior notes, as well as approximately $180.7 million of notes that were not exchanged for Prologis senior notes at the time of the Merger, are not subject to financial covenants.

We are also subject to financial covenants under our Credit Facilities and certain secured mortgage debt.

As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.

Debt Maturities

Principal payments due on our consolidated debt during each of the years
in the ten-year period ending December 31, 2022 and thereafter are as follows (in millions):

(1)

Our consolidated entities have $14.3 million available to borrow under credit facilities.

(2)

We expect to repay the amounts maturing in 2013 related to our wholly owned debt with cash generated from operations, proceeds from the disposition of
wholly owned real estate properties and with borrowings on our Credit Facilities. The maturities in 2013 in our consolidated but not wholly owned subsidiaries principally include $79.2 million of secured mortgage debt, which we expect to extend,

or pay, through the issuance of new debt, with proceeds from asset sales, available cash, or equity contributions to our consolidated entities by us and our venture partners.

(3)

The maturities in 2013 and 2015 include the aggregate principal amounts of the exchangeable senior notes, as this is when the holders first have the right to require us
to repurchase their notes for cash.

Interest Expense

Interest expense from continuing operations included the following components for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):

The amount of interest paid in cash, net of amounts capitalized, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010
was $546.6 million, $467.4 million and $381.8 million, respectively.

Stockholders’ Equity of the REIT

Shares Authorized

At December 31, 2012, 1.1 billion shares were authorized to be issued by the REIT, of which 1.0 billion shares represent common stock. The Board may,
without stockholder approval, classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our stock from time to time by setting or changing the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications
and terms or conditions of redemption of such shares.

Common Stock

In 2011, in connection with the Merger, holders of ProLogis common shares received 0.4464 of a newly issued share of AMB common stock, ProLogis became a subsidiary of AMB and AMB changed its name to
Prologis, Inc. Because ProLogis was the accounting acquirer (as discussed in Note 3), the historical ProLogis shares outstanding were adjusted by the Merger exchange ratio and restated. As of the Merger date, 169.6 million shares were added to
reflect the outstanding shares of common stock of AMB. In addition, in late June 2011 we issued 34.5 million shares of common stock generating net proceeds of $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2012, we had 461.8 million shares of
common stock outstanding.

We have sold or issued shares of common stock under various common stock plans, including stock-based compensation
plans as follows:

•

The Incentive Plan and Outside Trustees Plan:

Certain of our employees and outside directors participate in stock-based compensation plans
that provide compensation, generally in the form of common stock. In 2012, the new 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan was approved, which replaced all prior active incentive plans. See Note 14 for additional information on these plans.

•

1999 Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan, as amended (the “1999 Dividend Reinvestment Plan”):

Allowed holders of common
stock to automatically reinvest distributions and certain holders and persons who are not holders of common stock to purchase a limited number of additional shares of common stock by making optional cash payments, without payment of any brokerage
commission or service charge. In 2011, in connection with the Merger, this program was terminated.

•

Controlled Offering Program:

We had an agreement with two designated agents to sell shares of common stock and earn a fee of up to 2% of
the gross proceeds. There have been no shares of common stock issued since March 2010. In 2011, in connection with the Merger, this program was terminated.

•

ProLogis Trust Employee Share Purchase Plan (the “Employee Share Plan”):

Certain of our employees were able to purchase common
stock, through payroll deductions only, at a discounted price of 85% of the market price of the common stock. In 2011, in connection with the Merger, this program was terminated.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Under the common stock plans discussed above, we received gross proceeds of $31.0 million, $0.7 million
and $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, adjusted by the Merger exchange ratio of 0.4464 and issued shares of common stock for the years ended December 31, as follows (in thousands):

Limited partnership units were redeemed for 0.1 million and 0.1 million common shares in 2012 and 2010,
respectively. We did not redeem any limited partnership units in 2011. See Note 13 for more details.

Preferred Stock

At December 31, 2012, we had seven series of preferred stock outstanding. Holders of each series of preferred stock have, subject to certain
conditions, limited voting rights and all holders are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends based upon each series’ respective liquidation preference. The dividends for Series Q, R and S are payable quarterly in arrears on the
last day of March, June, September, and December. The dividends for Series L, M, O and P are payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of April, July, October and January. Dividends on preferred stock are payable when, and if, they have been
declared by the Board, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. After the respective redemption dates, each series of preferred stock can be redeemed at our option. The cash redemption price (other than the portion consisting of
accrued and unpaid dividends) with respect to Series Q Preferred Stock is payable solely out of the cumulative sales proceeds of our other capital stock, which may include stock of other series of preferred stock. With respect to the payment of
dividends, each series of preferred stock ranks on parity with the other series of preferred stock.

We had the following preferred stock
issued and outstanding as of December 31 (in thousands):

Terms and conditions of our preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2012 was as follows (dollars and shares in

Ownership Restrictions

For us to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, five or fewer individuals may not own more than 50% of the value of our outstanding stock at any time during the last
half of our taxable year. Therefore, our charter restricts beneficial ownership (or ownership generally attributed to a person under the real estate investment trust tax rules (i) by a person, or persons acting as a group, of each of our issued
and outstanding common, series L preferred stock, series M preferred stock, series O preferred stock and series P preferred stock, or (ii) series Q preferred stock, series R preferred stock or series S
preferred stock that, together with all other capital stock owned or deemed owned by that person, would cause that person to own or be deemed to own more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our issued and
outstanding capital stock. Further, subject to certain exceptions, no person shall at any time directly or indirectly acquire ownership of more than 25% of any of the series Q preferred stock, series R preferred stock and series S
preferred stock. These provisions assist us in protecting and preserving our real estate investment trust status and protect the interests of stockholders in takeover transactions by preventing the acquisition of a substantial block of outstanding
shares of stock.

Shares of stock owned by a person or group of persons in excess of these limits are subject to redemption by us. The
provision does not apply where a majority of the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, waives such limit after determining that the status of us as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes will not be jeopardized or the
disqualification of us as a real estate investment trust is advantageous to our shareholders.

Dividends

In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we paid all of our dividends in cash. The following summarizes the taxability of our common and preferred stock dividends for the years ended December 31:

(4)

Upon completion of the Merger, each outstanding Series C, F and G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share of beneficial interest in ProLogis was exchanged for a newly
issued share of Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series Q, R and S, respectively.

In order to comply with the real estate
investment trust requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, we are generally required to make common stock distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders at least equal to (i) the sum of (a) 90% of our “REIT
taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains and (b) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (ii) certain excess non-cash income. Our common stock
dividend policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure we will meet the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, while allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs, such as capital improvements and other investment
activities.

Common stock dividends are characterized for federal income tax purposes as ordinary income, qualified dividend, capital gains,
non-taxable return of capital or a combination of the four. Common stock dividends that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits (calculated for tax purposes) constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend and generally reduce
the stockholder’s basis in the common stock. To the extent that a dividend exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder’s basis in the common stock, it will generally be treated as a gain from the sale or
exchange of that stockholder’s common stock. At the beginning of each year, we notify our stockholders of the taxability of the common stock dividends paid during the preceding year.

The payment of common stock dividends is dependent upon our financial condition, operating results and real estate investment trust distribution requirements and may be adjusted at the discretion of the
Board during the year. A cash dividend of $0.28 per common share for the first quarter of 2013 was declared on February 27, 2013. The dividend will be paid on March 29, 2013 to holders of common shares on March 12, 2013.

Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until
all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.

Our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2012 has not been filed. The taxability information presented for our dividends paid in 2012 is based
upon management’s estimate. Our tax returns for open tax years have not been examined by the Internal Revenue Service, other than those discussed in Note 17. Consequently, the taxability of dividends is subject to change.

12.

Partners’ Capital of the Operating Partnership

For each share of common stock or preferred stock the REIT issues, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding common or preferred
partnership unit, as applicable, to the REIT in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. In addition, other third parties own common limited partnership units that make up 0.41% of the common partnership units.

As of December 31, 2012, the Operating Partnership had outstanding 461.8 million common general partnership units, 1.9 million
common limited partnership units and 21.3 million preferred general partnership units.

Distributions paid to the common limited
partnership units and the taxability of the distributions are similar to the REIT’s common stock disclosed above.

13.

Noncontrolling Interests

Operating Partnership

We report noncontrolling interests related to several entities we consolidate but do not own 100% of the common equity. These entities include three real
estate partnerships that have issued limited partnership units to third parties. Depending on the specific partnership agreements, these limited partnership units are exchangeable into shares of our common stock (or cash), generally at a rate of one
share of common stock to one unit. We evaluated the noncontrolling interests with redemption provisions that permit the issuer to settle in either cash or common stock at the option of the issuer to determine whether temporary or permanent equity
classification on the balance sheet is appropriate, including the requirement to settle in unregistered shares, and determined that these units meet the requirements to qualify for presentation as permanent equity. We also consolidate several
entities in which we do not own 100% and the units of the entity are not exchangeable into our common stock.

If we contribute a property to a
consolidated co-investment venture, the property is still reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements, but due to our ownership of less than 100%, there is an increase in noncontrolling interest related to the contributed properties, which
represents the cash we receive from our partners.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

REIT

The noncontrolling interest of the REIT includes the noncontrolling interests presented in the Operating Partnership, as well as the common limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership that are
not owned by the REIT. As of December 31, 2012, the REIT owned 99.59% of the common partnership units of the Operating Partnership.

The
following is a summary of the noncontrolling interest and the consolidated entity’s total investment in real estate and debt at December 31 (dollars in thousands):

(1)

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were 1,173,571 and 1,302,238 limited partnership units, respectively, that were exchangeable into an equal number of shares of
the REIT’s common stock. In 2012, 16,926 limited partnership units were redeemed for cash and 111,741 limited partnership units were redeemed for an equal number of common shares. In 2011, no outstanding limited partnership units were redeemed.
The majority of the outstanding limited partnership units are entitled to quarterly cash distributions equal to the quarterly dividends paid on our common stock. In 2012, we recorded an additional purchase accounting adjustment of $32.8 million
associated with the Merger.

(2)

In the second quarter of 2012, we purchased an additional interest in this venture from one of our partners for $14.1 million that increased our ownership to 28.2%.

(3)

In the second quarter of 2012, we contributed four properties aggregating 0.8 million square feet to this entity for $40.6 million. As this entity is consolidated,
we did not record a gain on this transaction. Also in 2012, this entity purchased two properties from third parties aggregating 0.4 million square feet. As a result of these transactions, the noncontrolling interests increased $39.8 million,
which is primarily due to our partners’ investment in cash.

(4)

We have a 50% ownership interest in and consolidate the Brazil Fund that in turn has investments in several joint ventures that are accounted for on the equity method.
The Brazil Fund’s assets are investments in unconsolidated entities of $152.2 million. For additional information on our unconsolidated investment see Note 6.

(5)

In 2012, we recorded additional purchase accounting adjustments of $22.7 million associated with the Merger.

(6)

In June 2012, the unitholders of PEPR passed a resolution to wind-up the entity, pursuant to which we opted for in-kind distribution of assets with responsibility for
all liabilities of PEPR. In September 2012, PEPR completed its delisting from two European stock exchanges, completed a distribution to the remaining common and preferred unitholders, and we acquired the remaining assets and liabilities.

(7)

At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, 1,893,266 and 2,058,730 units were associated with the common limited partners in the Operating Partnership and
were exchangeable into an equal number of shares of the REIT’s common stock. During 2012, 165,464 units were redeemed for cash for $5.8 million. The majority of the outstanding limited partnership units are entitled to quarterly cash
distributions equal to the quarterly distributions paid on our common stock.

Long-Term Compensation

In May 2012, the stockholders of the REIT approved the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2012 LTIP”), which replaced all
prior active long term incentive plans (“Prior Plans”). After approval of the 2012 LTIP, no further awards could be made under the Prior Plans but outstanding awards previously granted under Prior Plans will remain outstanding in
accordance with their terms. The number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2012 LTIP is equal to 12.0 million plus the aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the Prior Plans at the time the 2012 LTIP was
approved, resulting in a total of 27.2 million shares that have been reserved for issuance under the 2012 LTIP. As of December 31, 2012, there were 25.9 million shares of common stock available for future issuance at December 31,
2012 of which 9.5 million are subject to outstanding awards.

Officers, directors and other employees, consultants, and independent
contractors of the REIT or its subsidiaries are eligible to become participants in the 2012 LTIP. Awards made under the 2012 LTIP can be in the form of stock options (non-qualified options and incentive stock options), stock appreciation rights
(“SAR”), full value awards (restricted stock units and performance based shares) and cash incentive awards. No participant can be granted more than 1.5 million shares in any one calendar year. Awards can be made under the 2012
LTIP until it is terminated by the Board or until the ten-year anniversary of the effective date of the plan.

In 2011, in connection with the
Merger, each outstanding award of ProLogis was converted into 0.4464 of a newly issued award of the REIT. Additionally, the exercise prices of stock options and the grant date fair values of full value awards have been adjusted to reflect the
conversion of the underlying award. Values of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units of AMB were adjusted to their current fair value pursuant to the Merger. The fair value adjustment related to vested awards was recognized as an
adjustment to paid-in capital and the portion of the adjustment related to unvested awards is being amortized to expense over their remaining service periods.

Performance Plans

In 2012, we granted performance-based cash incentive awards under two
performance compensation plans approved by the compensation committee of the Board. Under the approved performance plans, referred to as the Outperformance Plan and the Private Capital Plan, certain officers and employees may earn incentive
compensation in the form of cash incentive awards or stock awards. The plans are designed such that awards will be paid only as a result of extraordinary performance by the Company.

Outperformance Plan (“OPP”)

For plan year 2012, cash incentive awards were granted in
February 2012 with a three-year performance period that began on January 1, 2012 and will end on December 31, 2014. These awards will only be earned to the extent our total shareholder return (“TSR”) for the performance period
exceeds the TSR for the MSCI US REIT Index for the same period plus 100 basis points. If this outperformance hurdle is met, the compensation pool will be equal to 3% of the excess value created, subject to a maximum of the greater of $75 million or
0.5% of the our equity market capitalization at the start of the performance period. For 2012, each participant was allocated a percentage of the total compensation pool. Awards earned, if any, for the performance period beginning in 2012 will be
paid in cash. Awards earned at the end of the performance period cannot be paid to participants unless our absolute TSR, as defined in the plan, is positive for the performance period. If the absolute TSR is not positive, payment will be delayed
until such time as our absolute TSR becomes positive. If after seven years our absolute TSR has not become positive, the awards will be forfeited.

As the initial three-year performance period is payable in cash, the awards are liability-classified. The grant-date fair value of the award is measured at the beginning of the performance period and is
amortized over the performance period. On a quarterly basis from the date of grant through the end of the performance period, the fair value of the award is re-measured and the expense is adjusted. We measure the liability at fair value each
reporting period using the Monte Carlo simulation model. We recognized $9.0 million of compensation expense related to plan year 2012 based on the fair value of the liability of $27.1 million as of December 31, 2012.

Private Capital Plan (“PCP”)

Under
the PCP, we established a compensation pool equal to 40% of the aggregate incentive fees earned by Prologis under agreements with our co-investment ventures. Each participant was allocated a percentage of the total compensation pool in February
2012. For plan year 2012, any awards earned under the PCP would be payable in cash. We evaluate the likelihood that we will earn incentive fees from our co-investment ventures on a quarterly basis. We record an accrual when it becomes probable and
estimateable that we will earn these fees. At December 31, 2012, we determined that it was not probable that we would earn incentive fees from our co-investment ventures and therefore did not recognize any revenue or compensation costs
associated with the PCP in 2012.

Stock Options

We have granted various stock options to our employees and outside directors, subject to certain conditions. Each stock option is exercisable into one share of common stock. Stock options granted to
employees generally have graded vesting over a three or four year period and have an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of the grant. Stock options granted to outside directors generally vest immediately or within one year of the
grant. The maximum contractual term of the stock option is ten years. No stock options were granted in 2012, 2011 and 2010. The outstanding options are primarily AMB stock options that we fair valued as of the Merger date.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The activity for the year ended December 31, 2012, with respect to our stock options is presented
below:

Total remaining compensation cost related to unvested options as of December 31, 2012, is $2.2 million, prior to
adjustments for capitalized amounts due to our development and leasing activities. The remaining expense will be recognized through 2015, which equates to a weighted average period of 0.6 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of exercised options was
$21.3 million.

As discussed in Note 3, we estimated the fair value of the AMB stock options using the Black-Scholes pricing model as of the
Merger date. The fair value of the vested awards were included as part of the total Merger consideration. We used the following assumptions:

Expected volatility

25-55%

Weighted average volatility

44.6%

Expected dividends

3.73%

Expected term (in years)

1-6

Risk-free rate

0.19-1.92%

We use historical data to estimate dividend yield, expected term and employee departure behavior used in the Black-Scholes
pricing model. The risk-free interest for periods within the expected term of the share option is based on the United States treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the Merger. To calculate the expected volatility of Prologis we weighted the
historical volatility of ProLogis and AMB, as well as peer group data.

Full Value Awards

We have granted full value awards, generally in the form of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based awards (“PSAs”), to
certain employees, generally on an annual basis. We also grant deferred stock units (“DSUs”) to our outside directors. Full value awards each represent one share of common stock and generally vest over a continued service period. Full
value awards earn cash dividends or dividend equivalent units (“DEUs”) (at our common stock dividend rate) over the vesting period that are charged to retained earnings.

The fair value of the full value awards is generally based on the market price of our common stock on the date the award is granted and is charged to compensation expense over the vesting or service
period. For RSUs and PSAs the vesting period is generally three years. DSUs issued in 2011 and 2010 were fully vested at grant. DSUs granted in 2012 vest on the earlier of the date of the first annual stockholders meeting after the grant date or the
first anniversary of the grant date.

The weighted average fair value of the full value awards granted during the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010 was $32.60, $34.13 and $23.75, respectively.

We granted PSAs in 2011 and 2010, but none were granted in 2012. Employees
were granted a targeted number of PSAs, which were then earned, based on specified performance criteria over a one-year performance period. PSAs earned are then subject to an additional two-year vesting period. During the performance period, the
unearned PSAs accrue DEUs, which will be earned and vested according to the underlying award.

In 2011, we granted 280,525 PSAs and based on
the attainment of specified individual and company performance goals, a total of 326,475 were earned. In 2010, we granted 242,406 PSAs and based on the attainment of specified individual and company performance goals, a total of 225,943 were earned.

Summary of Activity of our RSUs and PSAs

The activity for the year ended December 31, 2012 with respect to our RSU and PSA awards was as follows:

Restricted Stock

Restricted stock awards are full value awards that were granted under the AMB’s Prior Plans until the 2012 LTIP was approved. Restricted stock awards
are valued based on the market price of common stock on the grant date. The vesting period for restricted stock is generally three to four years. We recognize the value of the restricted stock earned as compensation expense over the applicable
service period, which is generally the vesting period. Restricted stock has voting rights during the vesting period.

The activity for the year
ended December 31, 2012, with respect to our unvested restricted stock was as follows:

Compensation Expense

During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $49.6 million, $31.5 million and $25.1 million, respectively, of compensation expense including awards granted to our
outside directors and net of forfeited awards. These amounts include expense reported as

General and Administrative Expenses

and

Merger, Acquisition and Other Integrated Expenses

and are net of $8.8 million, $8.7 million and
$5.3 million, respectively, that was capitalized due to our development and leasing activities.

Total remaining compensation cost related
to unvested full value awards as of December 31, 2012 was $51.4 million, prior to adjustments for capitalized amounts due to our development and leasing activities. The remaining expense will be recognized through 2015, which equates to a
weighted average period of 1.4 years. The fair value of the full value awards which vested in 2012 was $60.3 million.

Other Plans

In 2011, we had two 401(k) Savings Plan and Trusts (“401(k) Plans”), one from ProLogis and one from AMB. Effective
January 1, 2012, the AMB 401(k) Plan merged into the ProLogis 401(k) Plan, with the Prologis Plan (the “Plan”) continuing on as the surviving plan. The new Plan provides for matching employer contributions of 50 cents for every dollar
contributed by an employee, up to 6% of the employee’s annual compensation (within the statutory compensation limit). In the Plan, vesting in the matching employer contributions is based on the employee’s years of service, with 100%
vesting at the completion of one year of service.

In 2011, the ProLogis 401(k) plan provided for matching employer contributions of 50 cents
for every dollar contributed by an employee, up to 6% of the employee’s annual compensation (within the statutory compensation limit). Vesting in the matching employer contributions was based on the employee’s years of service, with 20%
vesting each year of service, over a five-year period. In the AMB 401(k) plan, matching employer contributions vested in full after one year of service by the employee.

In 2011, we had two nonqualified savings plans to provide benefits for certain employees, one from ProLogis and one from AMB. The purpose of these plans was to allow highly compensated employees the
opportunity to defer the receipt and income taxation of a certain portion of their compensation in excess of the amount permitted under the 401(k) Plans. In the ProLogis deferred compensation plan, we matched the lesser of (a) 50% of the sum of
deferrals under both the 401(k) Plan and this plan, and (b) 3% of total compensation up to certain levels. These matching contributions vested in the same manner as the ProLogis 401(k) Plan. In the AMB deferred compensation plan, employer
matching was not offered. Effective as of January 1, 2012, a new deferred compensation plan for Prologis was established. Employer matching is not offered in the new plan.

On a combined basis for all plans, our contributions under the matching provisions were $1.8 million, $1.6 million and $1.3 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Merger, Acquisition and Other Integration Expenses

In connection with the Merger and other related activities, we incurred significant transaction, integration, and transitional costs in
2011 and 2012. These costs included investment banker advisory fees; legal, tax, accounting and valuation fees; termination and severance costs (both cash and stock based compensation awards) for terminated and transitional employees;
non-capitalized system conversion costs and other integration costs. Certain costs were obligations of AMB and expensed prior to the closing of the Merger by AMB. The following is a breakdown of

these costs incurred for the years ended
December 31 (in thousands):

The costs incurred during 2011 principally included transaction and transitional costs directly related to the Merger,
including severance, and transactional costs associated with the PEPR Acquisition. At the time of the Merger, we terminated our existing credit facilities and wrote-off the remaining unamortized deferred loan costs associated with such facilities,
which is included in these costs

.

The costs in 2012 were related principally to severance in connection with the Merger; system implementation costs, as portions of the project move into the phase when the costs are expensed (i.e., training
and data conversion); additional costs due to the liquidation of PEPR and severance and related costs due to organizational changes in Europe to centralize finance activities and gain efficiencies.

Impairment Charges

Impairment of Real Estate Properties

We recognized impairment charges related to certain of our real estate properties for the years ended December 31 as outlined below (in thousands):

Land

In the
fourth quarter of 2012, we reviewed our land bank based on our current intent to hold long-term (through the development of an industrial property) or to sell. This review resulted in a change in our intent from long-term hold to sell for some
land parcels and the identification of other land parcels that had previously been impaired, through the 2010 review as discussed below, that are located primarily in Central and Eastern Europe for which the market has continued to lag in the global
economic recovery. We have not experienced the same improvement in land values in these regional and other European markets that we have had in a majority of our global markets. The fair value of the land parcels was based on internal valuations,
which were corroborated primarily from brokers’ opinion of value and comparable land sales, if available. If the carrying value of the land parcel exceeded fair value we adjusted the carrying value of the land. Accordingly, we recognized
impairment charges of $77.5 million based on our evaluation of our investment in land as of December 31, 2012.

Additionally during 2012,
we recorded impairment charges of $11.4 million on land parcels that we expected to sell as the carrying value exceeded the fair value at that time. The fair value of the land was based on purchase and sale agreements.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we made a strategic decision to more aggressively pursue land sales. As a result of this decision, we undertook a
complete evaluation of all land positions. As a result of our change in intent, if the carrying value of the land exceeded fair value, based on valuations and other relevant market data, we adjusted the carrying value of the land targeted for
disposition to fair value. Accordingly, we recognized impairment charges of $687.6 million based on our change in intent and evaluation of the fair value of our land as of December 31, 2010. We also recognized impairment charges of $47.1
million related to land sold as part of a larger transaction as discussed below.

Operating Properties

As discussed in Note 6, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement for the formation of a new fund in Europe, PELP. Based on this agreement, we assessed the recoverability of the portfolio of
assets we expect to contribute to PELP by comparing the total expected proceeds to the carrying value of the portfolio of assets as of December 31, 2012. As a result of this analysis, we recorded impairment charges of $135.3 million in
continuing operations.

Additionally, at December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges of $28.7 million in continuing operations
related to operating properties that we expect to sell or contribute to co-investment ventures. The impairment charges were calculated based on the carrying values of these assets as compared with the fair value.

Impairment charges of $30.6 million recorded in discontinued operations relate to operating properties that we expect to sell to third parties at less
than our carrying value at that time. We estimated fair value primarily based upon letters of intent, purchase and sale agreements, and third party appraisals. These properties were either sold during 2012 or are held for sale as of
December 31, 2012.

In 2011, we recorded impairment charges of $21.2 million in continuing operations related to real estate properties we
expected to sell. Impairment charges of $2.7 million recorded in discontinued operations related to the South Korean properties sold to a third party in 2011.

In 2010, we made a decision to sell our retail and mixed-use properties and certain other non-core real estate investments. As a result, we classified all of these assets and related liabilities as

Assets and Liabilities Held for

Sale in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010. Based on the carrying values of these assets and liabilities, as compared with the estimated sales proceeds less costs to sell,
we recognized an impairment charge of $168.8 million ($47.1 million related to land and included in Impairment of Real Estate Properties, $44.3 million related to the joint ventures and other assets and recorded in

Impairment of Goodwill and
Other Assets

(described below); and $77.4 million was associated with operating properties and included in Discontinued Operations –

Net Gains on Dispositions, Net of Related

Impairment Charges and Taxes

). We also recorded
impairment charges of $10.3 million related primarily to our industrial properties in South Korea that we sold in 2011.

Impairment of
Goodwill and Other Assets

We recognized impairment charges related to goodwill and other assets for the years ended December 31 as
outlined below (in thousands):

Goodwill

In
2010, we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill allocated to the Americas and Europe Real Estate Operations reporting units of $235.5 million and $132.9 million, respectively. As part of our review, we compared the estimated fair value of
each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. We estimated the fair value of assets and liabilities in each reporting unit through various valuation techniques as outlined in our summary of significant accounting policies. For the
Real Estate Operations reporting units in the Americas and Europe, the carrying values exceeded the fair values. We then calculated the implied goodwill for each reporting unit by allocating the estimated fair values to the underlying assets and
liabilities and determined that goodwill was impaired for each reporting unit.

The fair value of these reporting units in 2010 decreased due
principally to the strategic decision we made in the fourth quarter of 2010 to significantly downsize our development platform. As a result, we targeted for sale to third parties a substantial portion of our land that we had previously expected to
develop, some of which was acquired in the acquisitions that originally created the goodwill. In addition, we planned to sell to third parties our non-core and certain other assets that we acquired in connection with these same acquisitions.

Other Assets

In the second quarter
of 2011, we recorded impairment charges of $103.8 million primarily related to two of our investments in unconsolidated entities. This included one investment in the United States, Prologis NAIII, where our carrying value exceeded the fair value.
This entity has not had the same appreciation in value in its portfolio that we have experienced in our consolidated portfolio and in several of our other entities. We determined the fair value of the underlying real estate assets using discounted
cash flow models developed externally by a third party, which we corroborated through our discounted cash flow models. Based on the duration of time that the value of our investment has been less than carrying value and the lack of recovery as
compared to our other real estate investments, we no longer believed the decline to be temporary. Also included was our investment in a co-investment venture in South Korea that we sold to our venture partner in July 2011. We had previously
recognized an impairment associated with this investment due to the decline in value that we believed to be other than temporary.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

We had a receivable from an entity that developed retail and mixed use properties in Europe that was
secured by land parcels. In late 2011, the entity went into administration. In exchange for the note receivable, we received three land parcels and debt. Based on the fair value of the land less the assumption of debt received in the exchange and
information available to us in the fourth quarter of 2011, the remaining receivable balance of $20.5 million was impaired. In the first quarter of 2012, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $16.1 million as a result of additional
information that became available in the first quarter of 2012 and provided additional evidence indicating that the value of the land is less than originally estimated in the fourth quarter of 2011.

In 2010, we recorded impairment charges of $41.4 million for investments in other joint ventures and $2.9 million for a note receivable in connection with
the expected sale of these non-core real estate investments, as discussed above in real estate impairments.

Summary of Current and Deferred Income Taxes

Components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, were as follows (in thousands):

Current Income Taxes

Current income tax expense is generally a function of the level of income recognized by our TRSs, state income taxes, taxes incurred in foreign jurisdictions and interest and penalties associated with our
uncertain tax positions. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized a net $28.5 million benefit, $9.0 million benefit and $11.8 million expense, respectively, for uncertain tax positions. The benefit that was
recognized in all years relates to the reversal of certain expenses due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and settlements with the taxing authorities and the expense recognized relates to interest and penalties associated with our
uncertain tax positions.

During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was
$38.4 million, $41.2 million and $25.9 million, respectively.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences (principally basis differences between tax and financial reporting
for real estate assets and equity investments) and generation of tax net operating losses that may be realized in future periods depending on sufficient taxable income.

For federal income tax purposes, certain acquisitions have been treated as tax-free transactions resulting in a carry-over basis in assets and liabilities for tax purposes. For financial reporting
purposes and in accordance with purchase accounting, we record all of the acquired assets



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

and liabilities at the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. For our taxable subsidiaries, including international jurisdictions, we recognize the deferred income tax liabilities that
represent the tax effect of the difference between the tax basis carried over and the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets at the date of acquisition. If taxable income is generated in these subsidiaries, we recognize a deferred income
tax benefit in earnings as a result of the reversal of the deferred income tax liability previously recorded at the acquisition date and we record current income tax expense representing the entire current income tax liability. Any increases or
decreases to the deferred income tax liability recorded in connection with these acquisitions, related to tax uncertainties acquired, are reflected in earnings.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, were as follows (in thousands):

(1)

At December 31, 2012, we had net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards as follows (in millions):

The increase in deferred tax assets from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to NOL carryforwards recorded for certain
jurisdictions based on taxable losses incurred during 2012. Additionally, the increase is due to the capital loss carryforward created by the NAIF II transaction for one of our United States TRS entities.

The increase in deferred tax assets was more than offset by an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets. We recorded a
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions because we could not sustain a conclusion that it was more likely than not that we could realize the deferred tax assets and NOL carryforwards. The deferred tax asset valuation
allowance is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will “more-likely-than-not” be realized, as we are not currently forecasting sufficient taxable income for these benefits to be realized.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The decrease in deferred tax liabilities from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due the reversal of deferred tax
liabilities on real estate properties in Europe that were either sold to third parties or contributed to our co-investment ventures.

Liability for Uncertain Tax Positions

During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we believe that we and our consolidated REIT subsidiary have complied with the real estate
investment trust requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. The statute of limitations for our tax returns is generally three years. As such, our tax returns that remain subject to examination would be primarily from 2009 and thereafter. Our major
tax jurisdictions outside the United States are Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

The liability for uncertain tax positions principally consisted of estimated federal and state income tax liabilities and included accrued interest and penalties of $0.8 million and
$26.4 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. A reconciliation of the liability for uncertain tax positions was as follows (in thousands):

18.

Loss Per Common Share / Unit

We determine basic earnings per share/unit based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock/units outstanding during the
period. We compute diluted earnings per share/unit based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding combined with the incremental weighted average effect from all outstanding potentially dilutive instruments.

The following table sets forth the computation of our basic and diluted earnings per share/unit for the years ended December 31 (in thousands, except
per share/unit amounts):

(1)

In periods with a net loss, the inclusion of any incremental shares/units is anti-dilutive, and therefore, both basic and diluted shares/units are the same.

(2)

The increase in shares/units between the periods is due to the Merger (see Note 3 for more details) and an equity offering in June 2011.

(3)

Total weighted average potentially dilutive share awards and warrants outstanding (in thousands) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 9,805,
7,648 and 4,498, respectively.

(4)

The shares underlying the exchangeable debt have not been included because the impact would be anti-dilutive.

Related Party Transactions

In 2012 and 2010, Irving F. Lyons, III, member of the Board, Trustee of ProLogis prior to the Merger and former Chief Investment
Officer, converted limited partnership units in the limited partnerships, in which we own a majority interest and consolidate, into 45,600 and 22,431 shares of our common stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, Mr. Lyons owned 27,752
of the outstanding partnership units. See Note 13 for more information regarding these limited partnerships in the Americas.

Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements

Derivative Financial Instruments

In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage these risks, we may
enter into various derivative contracts. Foreign currency contracts, including forwards and options, may be used to manage foreign currency exposure. We may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate fluctuations. We do not use
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The majority of our derivative financial instruments are customized derivative transactions and are not exchange-traded. Management reviews our hedging program, derivative positions, and
overall risk management strategy on a regular basis. We only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk.

Our use of derivatives does involve the risk that counterparties may default on a derivative contract. We establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize this risk and provide counterparty
diversification. Substantially all of our derivative exposures are with counterparties that have long-term credit ratings of single-A or better. We enter into master agreements with counterparties that generally allow for netting of certain
exposures; thereby significantly reducing the actual loss that would be incurred should a counterparty fail to perform its contractual obligations. To mitigate pre-settlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of
the derivative financial instrument increases. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Based on these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be
minimal.

All derivatives are recognized at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets within the line items

Other Assets

or

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses

, as applicable. We do not net our derivative position by counterparty for purposes of balance sheet presentation and disclosure. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or
hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives are designated as, and qualify as, hedging instruments.

For derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments in accordance with the accounting standards, at inception of the
transaction, we formally designate and document the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, we formally assess both at
inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. The ineffective portion of a
derivative financial instrument’s change in fair value, if any, is immediately recognized in earnings. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations but do not meet
the strict hedge accounting requirements.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and
hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures
hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments will generally be offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or
did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, we reclassify changes in the fair value of derivatives into the applicable line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the
hedged items are recorded in the same period that the underlying hedged items affect earnings.

Foreign currency hedges

We hedge the net assets of certain of our international subsidiaries (net investment hedges) using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the
translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries. We measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedges by using the changes in forward exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management
strategies, the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries. Under this method, all changes in fair value of the forward contract are reported in
stockholders’ equity in the foreign currency translation component of

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

and offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which are also recorded
in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

. Ineffectiveness, if any, is recognized in earnings.

In 2012, we entered into 11 foreign
currency forward contracts that expire in April and May 2013 with an aggregate notional amount of €1.0 billion ($1.3 billion using the forward rate of 1.30) to hedge a portion of our investment in Europe at a fixed euro rate in U.S. dollars.
These derivatives were designated and qualify as hedging instruments and, therefore, the changes in fair value of these derivatives were recorded in the foreign currency translation component of

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $17.5 million recorded in

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to the fair value of these derivative contracts at December 31, 2012. Amounts included in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2012, were losses of $17.5 million. None of these hedges were ineffective during the year ended December 31, 2012, therefore, there was no
impact on earnings.

Interest rate hedges

Our interest rate risk management strategy is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows as well as to stabilize interest expense and manage our exposure to interest
rate movements. To achieve this objective, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements, which allow us to borrow on a fixed rate basis for longer-term debt issuances, or interest rate cap agreements, which allow us to minimize the impact of
increases in interest rates. We typically designate our interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements as cash flow hedges as these derivative instruments may be used to manage the interest rate risk on potential future debt issuances or to fix
the interest rate on variable rate debt issuances. The maximum length of time that we hedge our exposure to future cash flows is typically less than 10 years. We use cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets, liabilities
or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in interest rates.

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements which allow us to
receive variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of our agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. We had 32 interest rate swap contracts, which included 24
contracts denominated in euro, two contracts denominated in British pound sterling, five contracts denominated in Japanese yen and one contract denominated in U.S dollar, outstanding at December 31, 2012. During 2011, we acquired and settled an
interest rate cap agreement that allowed us to receive variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rose above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium. We had $28.0 million and $28.5 million accrued in

Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to these unsettled derivative contracts at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets, and reclassified to

Interest Expense

in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the corresponding period of the hedged item. The amounts reclassified to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was
$14.7 million. The amounts reclassified to interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were not considered material. For the next twelve months from December 31, 2012, we estimate that an additional expense of
$1.5 million will be reclassified into interest expense. Amounts included in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were losses of $33.8 million and $51.7 million,
respectively.

Losses on a derivative representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in

Interest Expense

at the time the
ineffectiveness occurred. We recorded losses due to hedge ineffectiveness of $2.4 million and $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We did not have any losses due to hedge ineffectiveness during the
year ended December 31, 2010. Also in 2012, we recorded a loss of $11.0 million in

Gain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net

related to interest rate swaps that were considered ineffective with a notional amount of $703.8 million.
These derivatives are associated with debt that was paid off in late January and early February 2013, or are expected to be transferred, in connection with the contribution to our new European co-investment venture, PELP (see Note 6 for more details
of this venture). When it was probable the related forecasted transaction would not occur, the hedge was deemed ineffective and the balance in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

was written off.

The following table summarizes the activity in our derivative instruments for the years ended December 31, as follows (in millions):

(1)

In 2012, we entered into four interest rate swap contracts with combined notional amounts of $445.4 million, with various expiration dates between 2017 and 2019. In
addition, we acquired one interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $71.0 million in connection with the acquisition of our interest in NAIF II. In connection with the Merger and PEPR Acquisition in 2011, we acquired various interest
rate swap contracts with combined notional amounts of $1.3 billion, with various expiration dates between October 2012 and January 2014. During the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a ¥13.0 billion interest rate contract that matures in
December 2014 to fix the interest rate on a variable rate TMK bond. We designated these contracts as cash flow hedges and they qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

(2)

To the extent these contracts previously qualified for hedge accounting, they were redesignated at the time of the acquisition to qualify for hedge accounting post
Merger and acquisition.

Fair Value Measurements

We have estimated the fair value of our financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a
high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that we would realize upon disposition.

Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring and Non-Recurring Basis

At December 31, 2012
and December 31, 2011, other than the derivatives discussed in this note and in Note 10, we do not have any significant financial assets or financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in our Consolidated Financial Statements consist of real
estate assets and investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities that were subject to impairment charges as discussed in Note 16. The table below aggregates the fair value of these assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, by
the levels in the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable and
accounts payable and accrued expenses were representative of their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the
contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. The fair values of our interest rate swaps are
determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments. The variable cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest
rates, or forward curves, derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of our net investment hedges are based upon the change in the spot rate at the end of the period as compared to the strike price at inception.

We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s
nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral
postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

We have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Although the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our
counterparties, we assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall
valuation of our derivatives.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of our senior notes and exchangeable senior notes has been
estimated based upon quoted market prices for the same (Level 1) or similar (Level 2) issues when current quoted market prices are available, the fair value of our Credit Facilities has been estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates
and borrowing spreads currently available to us (Level 3), and the fair value of our secured mortgage debt and assessment bonds that do not have current quoted market prices available has been estimated by discounting the future cash flows using
rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 3). The differences in the fair value of our debt from the carrying value in the table below are the result of differences in interest rates and/or borrowing spreads
that were available to us at December 31, 2012 and 2011, as compared with those in effect when the debt was issued or acquired. The senior notes and many of the issues of secured mortgage debt contain pre-payment penalties or yield maintenance
provisions that could make the cost of refinancing the debt at lower rates exceed the benefit that would be derived from doing so.

Commitments and Contingencies

Environmental Matters

A majority of the properties we acquire, including land, are subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners. In addition, we may
incur environmental remediation costs associated with certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the development of the land. We have acquired certain properties in urban and industrial areas that may have been leased to or previously owned
by commercial and industrial companies that discharged hazardous materials. We establish a liability at the time of acquisition to cover such costs and adjust the liabilities as appropriate when additional information becomes available. We purchase
various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Indemnification Agreements

We have indemnification agreements related to certain co-investment ventures operating outside of the United States for the contribution of certain properties. We may enter into agreements whereby we
indemnify the ventures, or our venture partners, for taxes that may be assessed with respect to certain properties we contribute to these ventures. Our contributions to these ventures are generally structured as contributions of shares of companies
that own the real estate assets. Accordingly, the capital gains associated with the step up in the value of the underlying real estate assets, for tax purposes, are deferred and transferred at contribution. We have generally indemnified these
ventures to the extent that the ventures: (i) incur capital gains or withholding tax as a result of a direct sale of the real estate asset, as opposed to a transaction in which the shares of the company owning the real estate asset are
transferred or sold or (ii) are required to grant a discount to the buyer of shares under a share transfer transaction as a result of the ventures transferring the embedded capital gain tax liability to the buyer of the shares in the
transaction. The agreements limit the amount that is subject to our indemnification with respect to each property to 100% of the actual tax liabilities related to the capital gains that are deferred and transferred by us to the ventures at the time
of the initial contribution less any deferred tax assets transferred with the property.

The ultimate outcome under these agreements is
uncertain as it is dependent on the method and timing of dissolution of the related venture or disposition of any properties by the venture. Two of our previous agreements were terminated without any amounts being due or payable by us. We consider
the probability, timing and amounts in estimating our potential liability under the agreements. Liabilities related to the indemnification agreements are recorded in

Other Liabilities

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We continue to
monitor these agreements and the likelihood of the sale of assets that would result in recognition and will adjust the potential liability in the future as facts and circumstances dictate.

Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities

We have issued performance and surety bonds and standby
letters of credit in connection with certain development projects. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the completion of the
improvements and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had approximately $27.8 million and $27.6 million, respectively, outstanding under such arrangements.

At December 31, 2012, we guaranteed $30.4 million of debt of certain of our unconsolidated entities. We may be required or choose to make additional capital contributions to certain of our
unconsolidated entities, representing our proportionate ownership interest, should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund development or acquisition costs, repayment of debt or operation shortfalls. See Note 6 for further
discussion related to equity commitments to our unconsolidated entities.



PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Litigation

In the normal course of business, from time to time, we and our unconsolidated entities are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that, with
respect to any such matters that we are currently a party to, the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

In December 2011, arbitration hearings began in connection with a dispute related to a real estate development project known as Pacific Commons. The
plaintiff, Cisco Technology, Inc., was seeking rescission of a 2007 Restructuring and Settlement Agreement (the “Contract”) and other agreements, and declaratory relief, and damages for breach of the Contract. In August 2012, the
arbitrator issued a ruling denying the relief sought by Cisco, and therefore Prologis had no further obligation.

22.

Business Segments

Our current business strategy includes two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Private Capital. We generate revenues,
earnings, net operating income and cash flows through our segments, as follows:

•

Real Estate Operations — This represents the direct long-term ownership of industrial operating properties and is the primary source of our core
revenue and earnings. We collect rent from our customers under operating leases, including reimbursements for the vast majority of our operating costs. Each operating property is considered to be an individual operating segment having similar
economic characteristics that are combined within the reportable segment based upon geographic location. Our real estate operations segment also includes development and re-development activities. We develop and re-develop industrial properties
primarily in global and regional markets to meet our customers’ needs. We provide additional value creation by utilizing: (i) the land that we currently own in global and regional markets; (ii) the development expertise of our local
personnel; (iii) our global customer relationships; and (iv) the demand for high quality distribution facilities in key markets. Land held for development, properties currently under development and land we own and lease to customers under
ground leases are also included in this segment.

We own real estate in the Americas (Canada, Mexico and the
United States), Europe (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and Asia (China, Japan and Singapore).

•

Private Capital — This represents the long-term management of unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other joint ventures. We have a direct and
long-standing relationships with a significant number of institutional investors. We tailor industrial portfolios to investors’ specific needs and deploy capital in both close-ended and open-ended venture structures and other joint ventures,
while providing complete portfolio management and financial reporting services. We recognize fees and incentives earned for services performed on behalf of the unconsolidated entities and certain third parties.

We report the costs associated with our Private Capital segment for all periods presented in the line item

Private Capital
Expenses

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs include the direct expenses associated with the asset management of the co-investment ventures provided by individuals who are assigned to our private capital segment. In
addition, in order to achieve efficiencies and economies of scale, all of our property management functions are provided by a team of professionals who are assigned to our real estate operations segment. These individuals perform the property-level
management of the properties we own and the properties we manage that are owned by the unconsolidated entities. We allocate the costs of our property management function to the properties we consolidate (reported in

Rental Expenses

) and the
properties owned by the unconsolidated entities (included in

Private Capital Expenses

), by using the square feet owned by the respective portfolios. We are further reimbursed by the co-investment ventures for certain expenses associated with
managing these co-investment ventures.

Each entity we manage is considered to be an individual operating segment having
similar economic characteristics that are combined within the reportable segment based upon geographic location. Our operations in the Private Capital segment are in the Americas (Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States), Europe (Belgium, the
Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and Asia (China and Japan).

We present the operations and net gains associated with properties sold to third parties or classified as held for sale as discontinued operations, which results in the restatement of prior year operating
results to exclude the items presented as discontinued operations.

Reconciliations are presented below for: (i) each reportable business
segment’s revenue from external customers to our

•

See Note 3 for information related to the Merger and PEPR Acquisition in 2011 and the Co-Investment Venture Acquisitions in 2012.

•

We received $17.7 million, $5.0 million and $4.6 million of ownership interests in certain unconsolidated entities as a portion of our proceeds
from the contribution of properties to these entities during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

Selected quarterly 2012 and 2011 data has been adjusted from previously disclosed amounts due to the disposal of properties in 2012
whose results of operations were reclassified to

Discontinued Operations

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The selected quarterly data was as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

(1)

Quarterly earnings per common share amounts may not total to the annual amounts due to rounding and the changes in the number of weighted common shares outstanding and
included in the calculation of diluted shares.

(2)

In periods with a net loss, the inclusion of any incremental shares is anti-dilutive, and therefore, both basic and diluted loss per share is the same.

(3)

Included in 2011 quarterly data is approximately one month of activity from the Merger and PEPR Acquisition in the period ended June 30, 2011 and a full period of
activity in the periods ended September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011. See Note 3 for more information.

(4)

As a result of the Merger, each outstanding common share of ProLogis was converted into 0.4464 of a newly issued share of common stock of the REIT. Therefore, the
historical ProLogis data related to quarterly earnings per common share for the periods ended before June 3, 2011 were adjusted by the Merger conversion ratio of 0.4464 and restated.

Subsequent Event

Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc.

On December 12, we announced the approval from our Board to sponsor a Japanese REIT (“J-REIT”) to serve as the long-term investment vehicle for our properties developed in Japan. In early
2013, we launched the initial public offering for Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. (“NPR”). On February 14, 2013, NPR was listed on the Japan Stock Exchange and commenced trading. At that time, NPR acquired a portfolio of twelve properties
from us for an aggregate purchase price of ¥173 billion ($1.9 billion), resulting in ¥153 billion ($1.7 billion at February 14, 2013) in net cash proceeds. We will retain at least a 15% equity ownership interest in NPR and will
provide pipeline, operational and personnel assistance under a support agreement. As a result of this transaction, in the first quarter we will recognize a gain of approximately $300 million (unaudited) after the deferral of the gain related to
our ongoing investment. We intend to use the proceeds primarily for the repayment of debt and future investment in Japan.
