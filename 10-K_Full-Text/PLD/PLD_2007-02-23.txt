FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS

Some of the information included in this annual report on

Form 10-K

contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to
    the safe-harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Because these
    forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and
    uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from those in the
    forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the
    forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The
    events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements
    might not occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by
    the use of forward-looking terminology such as
    “believes,” “expects,” “may,”
    “will,” “should,” “seeks,”
    “approximately,” “intends,”
    “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates”
    or “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and
    phrases, or similar words or phrases. You can also identify
    forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or
    intentions. Forward-looking statements should not be read as
    guarantees of future performance or results, and will not
    necessarily be accurate indicators of whether, or the time at
    which, such performance or results will be achieved. There is no
    assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in
    forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved.
    Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on
    assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise
    and we may not be able to realize them.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual
    results and future events to differ materially from those set
    forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:

•

changes in general economic conditions or in the real estate
    sector;

•

defaults on or non-renewal of leases by customers or renewal
    at lower than expected rent;

•

difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in
    effecting acquisitions on advantageous terms and the failure of
    acquisitions to perform as we expect;

•

risks and uncertainties affecting property development and
    renovation (including construction delays, cost overruns, our
    inability to obtain necessary permits and financing, public
    opposition to these activities, as well as the risks associated
    with our expansion of and increased investment in our
    development business);

•

risks of doing business internationally, including
    unfamiliarity with new markets and currency risks;

•

risks of opening offices globally (including increasing
    headcount);

•

a downturn in the U.S., California or the global economy or
    real estate conditions;

•

risks of changing personnel and roles;

•

losses in excess of our insurance coverage;

•

our failure to divest of properties on advantageous terms or
    to timely reinvest proceeds from any such divestitures;

•

unknown liabilities acquired in connection with acquired
    properties or otherwise;

•

risks associated with using debt to fund acquisitions and
    development, including re-financing risks;

•

our failure to obtain necessary financing;

•

risks associated with equity and debt securities financings
    and issuances (including the risk of dilution);

•

changes in local, state and federal regulatory
    requirements;

•

increases in real property tax rates;

•

increases in interest rates and operating costs or greater
    than expected capital expenditures;

•

environmental uncertainties; and

•

our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real
    estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
    as amended.


Our success also depends upon economic trends generally,
    various market conditions and fluctuations and those other risk
    factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in
    Item 1.A of this report. We caution you not to place undue
    reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our
    analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or as of
    the dates indicated in the statements. All of our
    forward-looking statements, including those in this report, are
    qualified in their entirety by this statement. We assume no
    obligation to update or supplement forward-looking
    statements.


PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation, acquires,
    develops and operates industrial properties in key distribution
    markets throughout North America, Europe and Asia. We use the
    terms “industrial properties” or “industrial
    buildings” to describe various types of industrial
    properties in our portfolio and use these terms interchangeably
    with the following: logistics facilities, centers or warehouses;
    distribution facilities, centers or warehouses; High Throughput
    Distribution

®

(HTD

®

) facilities;
    or any combination of these terms. We use the term “owned
    and managed” to describe assets in which we have at least a
    10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset
    manager, and which we intend to hold for the long-term.

We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate
    company effective with the completion of our initial public
    offering on November 26, 1997. Our strategy focuses on
    providing properties for customers who value the efficient
    movement of goods located mostly in the world’s busiest
    distribution markets: large, supply-constrained locations with
    proximity to airports, seaports and major highway systems. As of
    December 31, 2006, we owned, or had investments in, on a
    consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint ventures,
    properties and development projects expected to total
    approximately 124.7 million square feet (11.6 million
    square meters) and 1,088 buildings in 39 markets
    within twelve countries. Additionally, as of December 31,
    2006, we managed, but did not have a significant ownership
    interest in, industrial and other properties totaling
    approximately 1.5 million rentable square feet.

We operate our business primarily through our subsidiary, AMB
    Property, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer
    to as the “operating partnership”. As of
    December 31, 2006, we owned an approximate 95.0% general
    partnership interest in the operating partnership, excluding
    preferred units. As the sole general partner of the operating
    partnership, we have the full, exclusive and complete
    responsibility for and discretion in its

day-to-day

management and control.

Our investment strategy generally targets customers whose
    businesses are tied to global trade, which, according to the
    World Trade Organization, has grown two to three times the world
    gross domestic product growth rate during the last
    20 years. To serve the facility needs of these customers,
    we seek to invest globally in major distribution markets,
    transportation hubs and gateways that generally are tied to
    global trade.

Our strategy is to be a leading provider of industrial
    properties in supply-constrained submarkets of our targets
    markets. These submarkets are generally characterized by large
    population densities and typically offer substantial consumer
    concentrations, proximity to large clusters of
    distribution-facility users and significant labor pools, and are
    generally located near key international passenger and cargo
    airports, seaports and major highway systems. When measured by
    annualized base rent, on an owned and managed basis, 99.6% of
    our portfolio of industrial properties is located in our target
    markets, and much of this is in in-fill submarkets within our
    target markets. In-fill locations are characterized by supply
    constraints on the availability of land for competing projects
    as well as physical, political or economic barriers to new
    development.

Further, in many of our target markets, we focus on
    HTD

®

facilities, which are buildings designed to facilitate the rapid
    distribution of our customers’ products rather than storage
    of goods. Our investment focus on
    HTD

®

assets is based on what we believe to be a global trend toward
    lower inventory levels and expedited supply chains.
    HTD

®

facilities generally have a variety of physical characteristics
    that allow for the rapid transport of goods from

point-to-point.

These physical characteristics could include numerous dock
    doors, shallower building depths, fewer columns, large truck
    courts and more space for trailer parking. We believe that these
    building characteristics represent an important success factor
    for time-sensitive customers such as air express, logistics and
    freight forwarding companies, and that these facilities function
    best when located in convenient proximity to transportation
    infrastructure, such as major airports and seaports.


Of the approximately 124.7 million rentable square feet as
    of December 31, 2006:

•

on an owned and managed basis, which include investments held on
    a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint ventures,
    we owned and managed 964 industrial buildings, principally
    warehouse distribution facilities, encompassing approximately
    100.7 million rentable square feet that were 96.1% leased;

•

on an owned and managed basis, which include investments held on
    a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint ventures,
    we had investments in 45 industrial development projects which
    are expected to total approximately 13.7 million rentable
    square feet upon completion;

•

on a consolidated basis, we owned nine development projects,
    totaling approximately 2.7 million rentable square feet
    that are available for sale or contribution; and

•

through other non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, we had
    investments in 46 industrial operating properties, totaling
    approximately 7.4 million rentable square feet, and one
    industrial operating property, totaling approximately
    0.2 million square feet which is available for sale or
    contribution.

During 2006, our property acquisitions, on an owned and managed
    basis, totaled $834.2 million (including expected capital
    expenditures, and acquisitions by AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, an unconsolidated joint venture, totaling
    $540.0 million), primarily located in our target countries
    that included France, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, and the
    U.S. As of December 31, 2006, we had four industrial
    projects held for divestiture. Dispositions during 2006 totaled
    $335.1 million, including dispositions by two of our
    unconsolidated joint ventures of $159.8 million. Assets
    were divested in markets that no longer fit our investment
    strategy, such as Charlotte, Cincinnati and Memphis, and we also
    disposed of properties at valuation levels that we considered to
    be premium. While we continue to sell assets, we believe that we
    have achieved our near-term strategic disposition goals.
    Additionally, we contributed $607.3 million of completed
    development projects and a land parcel for $77.5 million to
    our private capital joint ventures as part of our continuing
    strategy to increase the proportion of our assets owned in
    co-investment joint ventures.

We are self-administered and self-managed and expect that we
    have qualified and will continue to qualify as a real estate
    investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with
    the year ended December 31, 1997. As a self-administered
    and self-managed real estate investment trust, our own employees
    perform our corporate administrative and management functions,
    rather than our relying on an outside manager for these
    services. We manage our portfolio of properties in a flexible
    operating model which includes both direct property management
    and a Strategic Alliance
    Program

®

in which we have established relationships with third-party real
    estate management firms, brokers and developers that provide
    property-level administrative and management services under our
    direction.

Operating
    Strategy

We base our operating strategy on a variety of operational and
    service offerings, including in-house acquisitions, development,
    redevelopment, asset management, property management, leasing,
    finance, accounting and market research. Our strategy is to
    leverage our expertise across a large customer base, and
    complement our internal management resources with long-standing
    relationships with entrepreneurial real estate management and
    development firms in certain of our target markets.

We believe that real estate is fundamentally a local business
    and best operated by local teams in each market comprised of AMB
    employees, local alliance partners or both. We intend to
    continue to increase utilization of internal management
    resources in target markets to achieve both operating
    efficiencies and to expose our customers to the broadening array
    of AMB service offerings, including access to multiple locations
    worldwide and

build-to-suit

developments. We actively manage our portfolio, whether directly
    or with an alliance partner, by establishing leasing strategies,
    negotiating lease terms, pricing, and level and timing of
    property improvements.

Growth
    Strategies

Growth
    through Operations

We seek to generate long-term internal growth through rent
    increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space by
    working to maintain a high occupancy rate at our properties and
    to control expenses by capitalizing on the economies of scale
    inherent in owning, operating and growing a large, global
    portfolio. During 2006, our average industrial property base
    rental rates decreased by 0.1% from the rent in place at
    expiration for that space on leases entered into or renewed
    during the period. This amount excludes expense reimbursements,
    rental abatements, percentage rents and straight-line rents.
    During 2006, cash basis same store net operating income (rental
    revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes
    for properties included in the same store pool, which is set
    annually and excludes properties purchased or developments
    stabilized after December 31, 2004) increased by 2.6%
    on our industrial properties. Since our initial public offering
    in November 1997, on a consolidated basis, we have experienced
    average annual increases in industrial property base rental
    rates of 4.4% and maintained an average quarter-end occupancy
    rate of 95.0% in our industrial property operating portfolio.
    While we believe that it is important to view real estate as a
    long-term investment, past results are not necessarily an
    indication of future performance. See Part II, Item 7:
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Supplemental
    Earnings Measures” for a discussion of same store net
    operating income and a reconciliation of same store net
    operating income and net income and Part IV,
    Item 15: Note 16 of the “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for detailed segment
    information, including revenue attributable to each segment,
    gross investment in each segment and total assets.

Growth
    through Development and Value-Added Conversions

We believe that development, redevelopment and expansion of
    well-located, high-quality industrial properties should continue
    to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a
    higher rate of return than we may obtain


from the purchase of existing properties. We believe we have the
    in-house expertise to create value both through new construction
    and acquisition and management of value-added properties.
    Value-added conversion projects represent the development of
    land or a building site for a more valuable use and may include
    such activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and
    retenanting. Both new development and value-added conversions
    require significant management attention and capital investment
    to maximize their return. Completed development properties are
    generally contributed to our co-investment joint ventures and
    held in our owned and managed portfolio or sold to third
    parties. We believe our global market presence and expertise
    will enable us to continue to generate and capitalize on a
    diverse range of development opportunities.

We believe that the multidisciplinary backgrounds of our
    employees should provide us with the skills and experience to
    capitalize on strategic renovation, expansion and development
    opportunities. Many of our officers have specific experience in
    real estate development, both with us and with national
    development firms, and over the past four years, we have
    significantly expanded our development staff. We pursue
    development projects directly and in joint ventures, providing
    us with the flexibility to pursue development projects
    independently or in partnerships, depending on market
    conditions, submarkets or building sites.

Growth
    through Acquisitions and Capital Redeployment

We believe that our acquisition experience and our network of
    property management, leasing and acquisition resources will
    continue to provide opportunities for growth. In addition to our
    internal resources, we have long-term relationships with
    third-party local property management firms, which we believe
    may give us access to additional acquisition opportunities, as
    such managers frequently market properties on behalf of sellers.
    We believe also that our UPREIT structure, which enables us to
    acquire land and industrial properties in exchange for limited
    partnership units in the operating partnership or AMB
    Property II, L.P., another of our operating partnerships,
    enhances our attractiveness to owners and developers seeking to
    transfer properties on a tax-deferred basis. In addition, we
    seek to redeploy capital from non-strategic assets into
    properties that better fit our current investment focus.

We are generally engaged in various stages of negotiations for a
    number of acquisitions and dispositions that may include
    acquisitions and dispositions of individual properties, large
    multi-property portfolios or other real estate companies. We
    cannot assure you that we will consummate any of these
    transactions. Such transactions, if we consummate them, may be
    material individually or in the aggregate. Sources of capital
    for acquisitions may include retained cash flow from operations,
    borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, other forms of
    secured or unsecured debt financing, issuances of debt or
    preferred or common equity securities by us or the operating
    partnership (including issuances of units in the operating
    partnership or its subsidiaries), proceeds from divestitures of
    properties, assumption of debt related to the acquired
    properties and private capital from our co-investment partners.
    See Part II, Item 7: “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Summary of Key Transactions in 2006.”

Growth
    through Global Expansion

By the end of 2010, we expect to have approximately 50% of our
    owned and managed operating portfolio invested in

non-U.S. markets

(based on annualized base rent). As of December 31, 2006,
    our

non-U.S. operating

properties comprised 14.1% of our owned and managed operating
    portfolio (based on annualized base rent) and 7.4% of our
    consolidated operating portfolio (based on annualized base
    rent). Our North American target countries outside of the United
    States currently comprise Canada and Mexico. Our European target
    countries currently comprise Belgium, France, Germany, Italy,
    the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our Asian target
    countries currently comprise China, India, Japan, Singapore and
    South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries
    outside the United States in the future.

We believe that expansion into target markets outside the
    U.S. represents a natural extension of our strategy to
    invest in industrial property markets with high population
    densities, close proximity to large customer clusters and
    available labor pools, and major distribution centers serving
    global trade. Our international expansion strategy mirrors our
    focus in the United States on supply-constrained submarkets with
    political, economic or physical constraints to new development.
    Our international investments extend our offering of
    HTD

®

facilities for customers


who value

speed-to-market

over storage. Specifically, we are focused on customers whose
    business is derived from global trade. In addition, our
    investments target major consumer distribution markets and
    customers. We believe that our established customer
    relationships, our contacts in the air cargo and logistics
    industries, our underwriting of markets and investments and our
    strategic alliances with knowledgeable developers and managers
    will assist us in competing internationally.

There are many factors that could cause our entry into target
    markets and future capital allocation to differ from our current
    expectations, which are discussed in this report under the
    heading “Business Risks — Risks Associated with
    Our International Business.” Further, it is possible that
    our target markets will change over time to reflect experience,
    market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global
    distribution patterns. For a discussion of the amount of our
    revenues attributable to the United States and international
    markets, please see Part IV,
    Item 15: Note 16 of the “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Growth
    through Co-Investments

We co-invest in properties with private-capital investors
    through partnerships, limited liability companies or joint
    ventures. Our co-investment joint ventures are managed by our
    private capital group and typically operate under the same
    investment strategy that we apply to our other operations.
    Typically, we will own a 15%-50% interest in our co-investment
    joint ventures. We believe that our co-investment program will
    continue to serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and
    developments; however, we cannot assure you that it will
    continue to do so. In addition, our co-investment joint ventures
    typically allow us to earn acquisition and development fees,
    asset management fees or priority distributions, as well as
    promoted interests or incentive distributions based on the
    performance of the co-investment joint ventures. As of
    December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million
    square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and
    development portfolio) through our consolidated and
    unconsolidated joint ventures.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

BUSINESS
    RISKS

Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse
    consequences to us. These risks include, among others:

General
    Real Estate Industry Risks

Our
    performance and value are subject to general economic conditions
    and risks associated with our real estate assets.

The investment returns available from equity investments in real
    estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital
    appreciation generated by the properties, as well as the
    expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our
    properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating
    expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then
    our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be
    adversely affected. In addition, there are significant
    expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such
    as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs)
    that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the
    income from the property. Income from, and the value of, our
    properties may be adversely affected by:

•

changes in the general economic climate;

•

local conditions, such as oversupply of or a reduction in demand
    for industrial space;

•

the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers;

•

competition from other properties;

•

our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance;

•

increased operating costs;


•

increased cost of compliance with regulations;

•

the potential for liability under applicable laws (including
    changes in tax laws); and

•

disruptions in the global supply chain caused by political,
    regulatory or other factors, including terrorism.

In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession in the
    United States and in other countries, rising interest rates or
    declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any
    of these events may occur, would result in a general decrease in
    rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing
    leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and
    results of operations. Future terrorist attacks may result in
    declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for
    and the value of our properties. To the extent that future
    attacks impact our customers, their businesses similarly could
    be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to
    honor their existing leases.

Our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial
    real estate sector. As a result of this concentration, we would
    feel the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more
    acutely than if our portfolio included other property types.

We may
    be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases
    expire.

As of December 31, 2006, leases on a total of 14.3% of our
    industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) will
    expire on or prior to December 31, 2007. We derive most of
    our income from rent received from our customers. Accordingly,
    our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our
    stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly
    relet or renew these expiring leases or if the rental rates upon
    renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected. If a
    customer experiences a downturn in its business or other type of
    financial distress, then it may be unable to make timely rental
    payments or renew its lease. Further, our ability to rent space
    and the rents that we can charge are impacted, not only by
    customer demand, but by the number of other properties we have
    to compete with to appeal to customers.

Actions
    by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases of the
    occupancy and rental rates of our properties.

We compete with other developers, owners and operators of real
    estate, some of which own properties similar to ours in the same
    submarkets in which our properties are located. If our
    competitors offer space at rental rates below current market
    rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our
    customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be
    pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently
    charge in order to retain customers when our customers’
    leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, cash flow,
    cash available for distribution, trading price of our common
    stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could
    be materially adversely affected.

Real
    estate investments are relatively illiquid, making it difficult
    for us to respond promptly to changing conditions.

Real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of
    assets. Further, the Internal Revenue Code regulates the number
    of properties that we as a real estate investment trust, can
    dispose of in a year, their tax bases and the cost of
    improvements that we make to the properties. In addition, a
    portion of the properties held directly or indirectly by certain
    of our subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for
    limited partnership units in the applicable partnership. The
    contribution agreements for such properties may contain
    restrictions on certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions
    of these properties, or a portion thereof, that result in a
    taxable transaction for specified periods, following the
    contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership.
    These limitations may affect our ability to sell properties.
    This lack of liquidity and the Internal Revenue Code
    restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio
    promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions
    and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to
    pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.


We
    could be adversely affected if a significant number of our
    customers are unable to meet their lease
    obligations.

Our results of operations, distributable cash flow and the value
    of our stock would be adversely affected if a significant number
    of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations to
    us. In the event of a significant number of lease defaults, our
    cash flow may not be sufficient to pay dividends to our
    stockholders and repay maturing debt. As of December 31,
    2006, we did not have any single customer account for annualized
    base rent revenues greater than 3.1%. However, in the event of
    lease defaults by a significant number of our customers, we may
    incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.

We may
    be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous terms or
    acquisitions may not perform as we expect.

We acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily
    industrial properties. The acquisition of properties entails
    various risks, including the risks that our investments may not
    perform as we expect, that we may be unable to quickly and
    efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing
    operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired
    property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further,
    we face significant competition for attractive investment
    opportunities from other well-capitalized real estate investors,
    including both publicly-traded real estate investment trusts and
    private institutional investment funds. This competition
    increases as investments in real estate become increasingly
    attractive relative to other forms of investment. As a result of
    competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties
    as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly
    elevated. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions
    through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit
    facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the
    operating partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from
    property divestitures, which may not be available and which
    could adversely affect our cash flow. Any of the above risks
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the
    market price of, our stock.

We may
    be unable to complete renovation and development projects on
    advantageous terms.

As part of our business, we develop new and renovate existing
    properties, and we intend to continue to expand and increase our
    investment in our development and renovation business. The real
    estate development and renovation business involves significant
    risks that could adversely affect our financial condition,
    results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends
    on, and the market price of, our stock, which include the
    following risks:

•

we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects
    on favorable terms and complete construction on schedule or
    within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and
    construction costs and delays in leasing the properties and
    generating cash flow;

•

we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in
    obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy
    and other governmental permits and authorizations;

•

the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing
    cash flow below budgeted amounts;

•

substantial renovation and new development activities,
    regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a
    significant amount of management’s time and attention,
    diverting their attention from our

day-to-day

operations; and

•

upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain,
    or obtain on advantageous terms, permanent financing for
    activities that we have financed through construction loans.

Risks
    Associated With Our International Business

Our
    international growth is subject to special risks and we may not
    be able to effectively manage our international
    growth.

We have acquired and developed, and expect to continue to
    acquire and develop, properties outside the United States.
    Because local markets affect our operations, our international
    investments are subject to economic


fluctuations in the international locations in which we invest.
    In addition, our international operations are subject to the
    usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax
    treaties or other laws and regulations, including those
    governing the taxation of our international revenues,
    restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of
    the world, uncertainty over property rights and political
    instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these
    developments may occur. Further, we have entered, and may in the
    future enter, into agreements with

non-U.S. entities

that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute
    resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We
    cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us
    with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that
    may arise. And even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory
    decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could
    have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely
    basis or at all.

We also have offices in many countries outside the United States
    and, as a result, our operations may be subject to risks that
    may limit our ability to effectively establish, staff and manage
    our offices outside the United States, including:

•

Differing employment practices and labor issues;

•

Local business and cultural factors that differ from our usual
    standards and practices;

•

Regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between
    jurisdictions; and

•

Health concerns.

Our global growth (including growth in new regions in the U.S.)
    subjects us to certain risks, including risks associated with
    funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and
    establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the
    operations of new offices. In addition, payroll expenses are
    paid in local currencies and, therefore, we are exposed to risks
    associated with fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the
    U.S. dollar and these currencies.

Further, our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow
    through international property acquisitions and developments. If
    we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock
    could be adversely affected.

Acquired
    properties may be located in new markets, where we may face
    risks associated with investing in an unfamiliar
    market.

We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in
    international markets that are new to us. When we acquire
    properties located in these markets, we may face risks
    associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of
    the local economy, forging new business relationships in the
    area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting
    procedures. We work to mitigate such risks through extensive
    diligence and research and associations with experienced
    partners; however, there can be no guarantee that all such risks
    will be eliminated.

We are
    subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates
    between the U.S. dollar and the

currencies of the other countries in which we
    invest.

We are pursuing, and intend to continue to pursue, growth
    opportunities in international markets. As we invest in
    countries where the U.S. dollar is not the national
    currency, we are subject to international currency risks from
    the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the
    U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. A
    significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or
    more countries where we have a significant investment may
    materially affect our results of operations. We attempt to
    mitigate any such effects by borrowing under our multi-currency
    credit facility in the currency of the country we are investing
    in and, under certain circumstances, by putting in place
    international currency put option contracts to hedge exchange
    rate fluctuations. For leases denominated in international
    currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to
    manage the international currency exchange risk. We cannot,
    however, assure you that our efforts will successfully
    neutralize all international currency risks. If we do engage in
    international currency exchange rate hedging activities, any
    income recognized with respect to these hedges (as well as any
    international currency gain recognized with respect to changes
    in


exchange rates) may not qualify under the 75% gross income test
    or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in
    order to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate
    investment trust.

General
    Business Risks

Our
    performance and value are impacted by the local economic
    conditions of and the risks associated with doing business in
    California.

As of December 31, 2006, our industrial properties located
    in California represented 25.3% of the aggregate square footage
    of our industrial operating properties and 25.4% of our
    industrial annualized base rent, on an owned and managed basis.
    Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in
    California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such
    as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties)
    and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing,
    industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may
    adversely impact California’s economic climate. Because of
    the number of properties we have located in California, a
    downturn in California’s economy or real estate conditions
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the
    market price of, our stock.

We may
    experience losses that our insurance does not
    cover.

We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss
    insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in
    types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate
    given the relative risks applicable to the property, the cost of
    coverage and industry practice. Certain losses, such as those
    due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity, may be
    insured subject to certain limitations, including large
    deductibles or co-payments and policy limits. Although we have
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially
    reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage, we
    cannot be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on
    comparable terms or collect under such policies. In addition,
    there are other types of losses, such as those from riots,
    bio-terrorism or acts of war, that are not generally insured in
    our industry because it is not economically feasible to do so.
    We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and
    we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at
    commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is
    uninsured or that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one
    or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital
    invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated
    future revenue from those properties and, if there is recourse
    debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or
    other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover,
    as the general partner of the operating partnership, we
    generally will be liable for all of the operating
    partnership’s unsatisfied recourse obligations, including
    any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the
    general partner of co-investment joint ventures. Any such losses
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the
    market price of, our stock.

A number of our properties are located in areas that are known
    to be subject to earthquake activity. U.S. properties
    located in active seismic areas include properties in the
    San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Our
    largest concentration of such properties is in California where,
    on an owned and managed basis, as of December 31, 2006, we
    had 267 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately
    25.5 million square feet and representing 25.3% of our
    industrial operating properties based on aggregate square
    footage and 25.4% based on industrial annualized base rent, on
    an owned and managed basis. International properties located in
    active seismic areas include Tokyo and Osaka, Japan and Mexico
    City, Mexico. We carry earthquake insurance on all of our
    properties located in areas historically subject to seismic
    activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that
    we believe are commercially reasonable. We evaluate our
    earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current
    industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside
    consultants.

A number of our properties are located in areas that are known
    to be subject to hurricane

and/or

flood
    risk. We carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of
    our properties located in areas historically subject to such
    activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that
    we believe are commercially reasonable. We evaluate our
    insurance coverage annually in light of current industry
    practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants. In
    2005, various properties that we own or lease in New Orleans,
    Louisiana and South Florida suffered damage as a result of
    Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Although we expect that our
    insurance will cover losses


arising from this damage in excess of the deductibles paid by us
    and do not believe that such losses would have a material
    adverse effect on our business, assets or results from
    operations, we cannot assure you that we will be reimbursed for
    all losses incurred.

We are
    subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties
    owned through joint ventures, limited liability companies and
    partnerships.

As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately
    64.3 million square feet of our properties through several
    joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with
    third parties. Our organizational documents do not limit the
    amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships,
    limited liability companies or joint ventures and we intend to
    continue to develop and acquire properties through joint
    ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with
    other persons or entities when warranted by the circumstances.
    Such partners may share certain approval rights over major
    decisions. Partnership, limited liability company or joint
    venture investments involve certain risks, including:

•

if our partners, co-members or joint venturers go bankrupt, then
    we and any other remaining general partners, members or joint
    venturers would generally remain liable for the
    partnership’s, limited liability company’s or joint
    venture’s liabilities;

•

if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital
    contributions, then we may be required to contribute such
    capital;

•

our partners, co-members or joint venturers might have economic
    or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with
    our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to
    operate the property;

•

our partners, co-members or joint venturers may have the power
    to act contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or
    objectives, including our current policy with respect to
    maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust;

•

the joint venture, limited liability and partnership agreements
    often restrict the transfer of a joint venture’s,
    member’s or partner’s interest or may otherwise
    restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on
    advantageous terms;

•

our relationships with our partners, co-members or joint
    ventures are contractual in nature and may be terminated or
    dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event,
    we may not continue to own or operate the interests or assets
    underlying such relationship or may need to purchase such
    interests or assets at an above-market price to continue
    ownership;

•

disputes between us and our partners, co-members or joint
    venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would
    increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors
    from focusing their time and effort on our business and result
    in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable
    partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture to
    additional risk; and

•

we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our
    partners, co-members or joint venturers.

We generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our
    partnerships, limited liability companies and joint ventures to
    permit us to achieve our business objectives, however, we may
    not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the
    events described above could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

We may
    be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous terms or
    contribute properties.

We intend to continue to divest ourselves of properties that do
    not meet our strategic objectives, provided that we can
    negotiate acceptable terms and conditions. Our ability to
    dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors
    beyond our control, including competition from other sellers and
    the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of
    our properties. If we are unable to dispose of properties on
    favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property
    divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy, then
    our financial


condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be
    adversely affected.

We also anticipate contributing or selling properties to funds
    and joint ventures. If the funds are unable to raise additional
    capital on favorable terms after currently available capital is
    depleted or if the value of such properties are appraised at
    less than the cost of such properties, then such contributions
    or sales could be delayed or prevented, adversely affecting our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.
    For example, although we have acquired land for development and
    made capital commitments in Japan and Mexico, we cannot be
    assured that we ultimately will be able to contribute such
    properties to funds or joint ventures as we have planned.

Contingent
    or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

We have acquired and may in the future acquire properties
    subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only
    limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a
    result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon
    ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might
    have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely
    affect our cash flow. Contingent or unknown liabilities with
    respect to entities or properties acquired might include:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
    of business;

•

tax liabilities; and

•

claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and
    directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the
    properties.

We are
    dependent on external sources of capital.

In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we are
    required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least
    90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income
    (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and
    by excluding any net capital gain) and are taxed on our income
    to the extent it is not fully distributed. Consequently, we may
    not be able to fund all future capital needs, including
    acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from
    operations and must rely on third-party sources of capital.
    Further, in order to maintain our real estate investment trust
    status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may
    need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the real
    estate investment trust distribution requirements even if the
    then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these
    borrowings. These short-term borrowing needs could result from
    differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and
    inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the
    effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of
    reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability
    to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or
    at all is dependent upon a number of factors, including general
    market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth
    potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash
    distributions and the market price of our capital stock.

Debt
    Financing Risks

We
    could incur more debt, increasing our debt
    service.

It is our policy to incur debt, either directly or through our
    subsidiaries, only if it will not cause our share of total

debt-to-our

share of total market capitalization ratio to exceed
    approximately 45%. Our definition of “our share of total
    market capitalization” is our share of total debt plus
    preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See
    footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table contained in
    Part II, Item 7: “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operation — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for
    our definitions of “market equity” and “our share
    of total debt.” The aggregate amount of indebtedness that
    we may incur under our policy increases directly with an
    increase in the market price per share of our capital stock.
    Further, our management could alter or eliminate this policy
    without stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we


could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in
    debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for
    distribution to our stockholders.

We
    face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions
    and developments, including refinancing risk.

As of December 31, 2006, we had total debt outstanding of
    $3.4 billion. We guarantee the operating partnership’s
    obligations with respect to the senior debt securities
    referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks
    normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that
    our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of
    principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a
    small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity.
    Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion
    of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we
    may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of
    any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our
    existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal
    payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other
    capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not
    be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders
    and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing
    interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such
    as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate
    loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then
    the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness
    would increase.

In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to
    secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet
    mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or
    transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income
    and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the
    market price of, our stock.

Covenants
    in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness
    require that we comply with a number of financial and other
    covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and
    leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These
    covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our
    failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default
    under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied
    our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2006, we had
    certain non-recourse, secured loans, which are
    cross-collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on
    any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such
    indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to
    avoid foreclosure on all the cross-collateralized properties
    within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or
    our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could
    adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price
    of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior
    debt securities contain certain cross-default provisions, which
    are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness
    is in default. These cross-default provisions may require us to
    repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt
    securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in
    default, which could adversely affect our financial condition,
    results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends
    on, and the market price of, our stock.

Failure
    to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect
    results of operations.

We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by
    using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate
    cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These
    agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the
    counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these
    arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in
    reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court
    could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable.
    Hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. Failure
    to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may
    materially adversely affect our results of operations.


Conflicts
    of Interest Risks

Some
    of our directors and executive officers are involved in other
    real estate activities and investments and, therefore, may have
    conflicts of interest with us.

From time to time, certain of our executive officers and
    directors may own interests in other real-estate related
    businesses and investments, including de minimis holdings of the
    equity securities of public and private real estate companies.
    Our executive officers’ involvement in other real
    estate-related activities could divert their attention from our

day-to-day

operations. Our executive officers have entered into
    non-competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have
    agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly,
    in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any
    investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate,
    other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the
    outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such
    activities or through certain specified investments. State law
    may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. We will not
    acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or
    their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a
    majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the
    rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of
    directors with respect to that transaction.

Our
    role as general partner of the operating partnership may
    conflict with the interests of our stockholders.

As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have
    fiduciary obligations to the operating partnership’s
    limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the
    interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons
    holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as
    a class on certain amendments to the operating
    partnership’s partnership agreement and individually to
    approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their
    rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in
    a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders.
    In addition, under the terms of the operating partnership’s
    partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will
    have certain approval rights with respect to certain
    transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not
    exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all
    stockholders.

Risks
    Associated with Government Regulations

The
    costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and
    any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for
    these items.

Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a
    current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be
    liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of
    certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at,
    on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or
    remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws
    typically impose liability and

clean-up

responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator
    knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more
    than one person may have been responsible for the contamination,
    each person covered by the environmental laws may be held
    responsible for all of the

clean-up

costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or
    operator of a site for damages based on personal injury,
    property damage or other costs, including investigation and

clean-up

costs, resulting from the environmental contamination.

Environmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also
    require that owners or operators of buildings containing
    asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately
    inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos
    and undertake special precautions, including removal or other
    abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during
    building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines
    and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply
    with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek
    recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated
    with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain
    asbestos-containing building materials.

In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been
    leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use,
    store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous
    or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of
    such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our
    properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that
    have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other
    hazardous or toxic


substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or
    may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or
    toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties,
    or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental
    conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities
    associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the
    acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. In such
    an instance, we underwrite the costs of environmental
    investigation,

clean-up

and
    monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate
    environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection
    with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain
    responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or
    monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.

At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to
    a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by
    independent environmental consultants and we may have additional
    Phase II testing performed upon the consultant’s
    recommendation. These environmental assessments have not
    revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability
    that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
    Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal
    all environmental liabilities and that there are material
    environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known
    environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are
    greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties’
    current environmental condition may be affected by customers,
    the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the
    properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks) or
    by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with
    existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our
    budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and
    the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected.

Compliance
    or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act
    and other similar regulations could result in substantial
    costs.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public
    accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to
    access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result
    in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the
    award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to
    make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans
    with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then
    our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our
    stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also
    subject to various federal, state and local regulatory
    requirements, such as state and local fire and life-safety
    requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if
    we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that
    our properties are currently in material compliance with these
    regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new
    requirements may be imposed that could require significant
    unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow
    and results of operations.

Federal
    Income Tax Risks

Our
    failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have
    serious adverse consequences to our stockholders.

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under
    Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”)
    commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997.
    We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate
    investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe
    that our current organization and method of operation comply
    with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal
    Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real
    estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have
    been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow
    us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our
    future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.
    Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to
    satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a
    quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex
    Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only
    limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and
    involves the determination of various factual matters and
    circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in
    order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must
    derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from
    qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to
    stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real
    estate investment trust taxable income (determined without
    regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital
    gains) and must satisfy


specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and
    the applicable Treasury regulations are more complicated in our
    case because we hold our assets through the operating
    partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative
    interpretations or court decisions could significantly change
    the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate
    investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such
    qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax
    legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify
    as a real estate investment trust.

If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any
    taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax
    (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our
    taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are
    entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would
    be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust
    for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost
    qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust
    status, then our net earnings available for investment or
    distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for
    each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be
    required to make distributions to our stockholders.

Certain
    property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income,
    resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the
    transaction.

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some
    of our properties, including the contribution of properties to
    our joint venture funds. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any
    gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as
    inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary
    course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited
    transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire
    properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our
    occasional transfers or disposals of property or our
    contributions of properties into our joint venture funds are
    properly treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether
    property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact
    that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the
    particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend
    that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us or
    contributions of properties into our joint venture funds are
    prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal
    Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the
    Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a
    transfer or disposition or contribution of property constituted
    a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a
    100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited
    transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction
    might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests
    for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal
    income tax purposes.

Risks
    Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel

We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key
    employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may
    change. While we believe that we could find suitable employees
    to meet our personnel needs, the loss of key personnel, any
    change in their roles, or the limitation of their availability
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the
    market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements
    with any of our executive officers.

Because our compensation packages include equity-based
    incentives, pressure on our stock price or limitations on our
    ability to award such incentives could affect our ability to
    offer competitive compensation packages to our executives and
    key employees. If we are unable to continue to attract and
    retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required
    to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our
    performance and competitive position could be materially
    adversely affected.

Risks
    Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
    business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in
    our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over
    financial reporting.

The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
    procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not
    prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While
    management will continue to review the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
    financial reporting,


there can be no guarantee that our internal control over
    financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all
    control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any
    material weakness, in our internal control over financial
    reporting which may occur in the future could result in
    misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our
    financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise
    materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of
    operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Risks
    Associated with Ownership of Our Stock

Limitations
    in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in
    control.

Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer or
    prevent a change in control or other transaction that could
    provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to
    realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the
    common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate
    investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than
    50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or
    constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the
    Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the
    last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for
    which a real estate investment trust election is made.
    Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of
    100 persons for at least 335 days of a

12-month

taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In
    addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock,
    actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our
    customers (or a customer of any partnership in which we are a
    partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or
    through any such partnership) from that customer will not be
    qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment
    trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help
    us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust
    for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership,
    actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions
    of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than
    9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more
    restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our
    common stock, series L preferred stock, series M
    preferred stock, series O preferred stock, and
    series P preferred stock. We also prohibit the ownership,
    actually or constructively, of any shares of our
    series D, I, J and K preferred stock by any single
    person so that no such person, taking into account all of our
    stock so owned by such person, including any common stock or
    other series of preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of
    our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this
    limitation as the “ownership limit.” Shares acquired
    or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred
    to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable
    beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the
    ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the
    shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds
    from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser
    of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the
    sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may
    be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may
    have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in
    control and, therefore, could adversely affect our
    stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the
    then-prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock
    in connection with such transaction.

Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common
    and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and
    other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we
    issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so
    at the present time, it could establish a series or class of
    preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying,
    deferring or preventing a transaction, including a change in
    control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock
    or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other
    provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders
    without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may
    delay, defer or prevent a transaction, including a change in
    control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include:

•

directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a
    two-thirds vote of stockholders;

•

our board can fix the number of directors within set limits
    (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill
    vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the
    remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the
    case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the
    board, a majority of the entire board;


•

stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or
    propose business for consideration at a stockholders’
    meeting; and

•

the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is
    necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting.

Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include:

•

a two-thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our
    charter; and

•

stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous
    approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in
    question.

In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder
    approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may
    impede a change in control.

The
    market value of our stock could be substantially affected by
    various factors.

As with other publicly traded securities, the trading price of
    our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our
    control and may change from time to time, including:

•

the extent of investor interest in us;

•

the market for similar securities issued by real estate
    investment trusts;

•

the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the
    attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other
    equity securities (including securities issued by other real
    estate-based companies);

•

general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in
    interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead
    prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual
    yield from future dividends;

•

terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our
    securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and
    causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence
    and spending;

•

general economic conditions; and

•

our financial condition, performance and prospects.

Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes
    in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future
    trading price of our stock.

If we
    issue additional securities, then the investment of existing
    stockholders will be diluted.

As a real estate investment trust, we are dependent on external
    sources of capital and may issue common or preferred stock or
    debt securities to fund our future capital needs. We have
    authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or
    debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership or AMB
    Property II, L.P., to issue limited partnership units, in
    exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have
    no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued
    by the operating partnership, AMB Property II, L.P., or us
    and any issuance of additional equity securities may adversely
    effect the market price of our stock and could result in
    dilution of an existing stockholder’s investment.

Earnings,
    cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the
    price of our stock.

As a real estate investment trust, the market value of our
    equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the
    market’s perception of our growth potential and our current
    and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity
    securities’ market value is based secondarily upon the
    market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this
    reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher
    or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that
    we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working
    capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while
    increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not
    correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our
    failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to
    future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect
    the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield
    on the stock (as


a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market
    interest rates may also influence the price of our stock. An
    increase in market interest rates might lead prospective
    purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield,
    which would adversely affect our stock’s market price.
    Additionally, if the market price of our stock declines
    significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with
    respect to our debt obligations, which could adversely affect
    our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our
    ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.

We
    could change our investment and financing policies without a
    vote of stockholders.

Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our
    qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change
    is approved by our board of directors under certain
    circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment
    and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt,
    capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Our board
    of directors may revise or amend these strategies and policies
    at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may
    not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely
    affect our financial condition or results of operations,
    including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.

Shares
    available for future sale could adversely affect the market
    price of our common stock.

The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had
    4,709,056 common limited partnership units issued and
    outstanding as of December 31, 2006, which may be exchanged
    generally one year after their issuance on a

one-for-one

basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the
    operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue
    additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of
    common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties
    or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the
    shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited
    partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets
    over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted,
    or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to
    Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock
    option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market
    pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or
    pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2006, under
    our stock option and incentive plans, we had
    3,230,106 shares of common stock reserved and available for
    future issuance, had outstanding options to purchase
    6,843,025 shares of common stock (of which 5,404,361 are
    vested and exercisable) and had 611,549 unvested restricted
    shares of common stock outstanding. Future sales of a
    substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market
    or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely
    affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the
    existence of the operating partnership’s limited
    partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved
    for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the
    exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above,
    may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain
    additional capital through the sale of equity securities.

INDUSTRIAL
    PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2006, we owned and managed 964
    industrial buildings aggregating approximately
    100.7 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated
    basis, we had 820 industrial buildings aggregating approximately
    80.3 million rentable square feet), excluding development
    and renovation projects and recently completed development
    projects available for sale or contribution, located in 34
    markets throughout the United States and in China, France,
    Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands. Our industrial
    properties were 96.1% leased to 2,633 customers, the
    largest of which accounted for no more than 3.1% of our
    annualized base rent from our industrial properties. See
    Part IV, Item 15: Note 16 of “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for segment information
    related to our operations.

Property Characteristics.

Our industrial
    properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution
    facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are
    typically comprised of multiple buildings.


The following table identifies types and characteristics of our
    industrial buildings and each type’s percentage, based on
    square footage, of our total owned and managed operating

The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis
    while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and
    managed basis. Management believes that the difference in
    comparability between 2006 and 2005 is not significant.

Lease Terms.

Our industrial properties are
    typically subject to lease on a “triple net basis,” in
    which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate
    taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases
    on a “modified gross basis,” in which customers pay
    expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of our
    leases include fixed rental increases or Consumer Price
    Index-based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from
    three to ten years, with a weighted average of six years,
    excluding renewal options. However, the majority of our
    industrial leases do not include renewal options.

Overview of Major Target Markets.

Our
    industrial properties are typically located near major airports,
    key interstate highways and seaports in major
    U.S. metropolitan areas, which currently comprise Atlanta,
    Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/New
    York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. Our
    other U.S. target markets include Austin,
    Baltimore/Washington D.C., Boston, Houston, Minneapolis and
    Orlando. Our

non-U.S. industrial

properties are located in major distribution markets, including
    Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Guadalajara, Hamburg, Lyon, Mexico City,
    Osaka, Paris, Queretaro, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto.

Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are
    generally concentrated in locations with limited new
    construction opportunities within established, relatively large
    submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of
    occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere.
    These in-fill locations are typically near major airports,
    seaports or convenient to major highways and rail lines, and are
    proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is typically
    broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located
    submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of
    industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light
    assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations at the
    periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer
    constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties.


Owned and
    Managed Market Operating Statistics(1)

As of December 31, 2006, we held investments in operating
    properties in 34 markets in our owned and managed operating
    portfolio throughout the United States and in China, France,
    Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands. The following table
    represents properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership
    interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and
    which we intend to hold for the long-term:

Properties
    held through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies and
    Partnerships

Consolidated
    Joint Ventures:

As of December 31, 2006, we held interests in joint
    ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with
    institutional investors and other third parties, which we
    consolidate in our financial statements. Such investments are
    consolidated because we own a majority interest or, as general
    partner, exercise significant control over major operating
    decisions such as acquisition or disposition decisions, approval
    of budgets, selection of property managers and changes in
    financing. Under the agreements governing the joint ventures, we
    and the other party to the joint venture may be required to make
    additional capital contributions and, subject to certain
    limitations, the joint ventures may incur additional debt. Such
    agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of
    joint venture interests by us or the other party to the joint
    venture and typically provide certain rights to us or the other
    party to the joint venture to sell our or their interest in the
    joint venture to the joint venture or to the other joint-venture
    partner on terms specified in the agreement. In addition, under
    certain circumstances, many of the joint


ventures include buy/sell provisions. See Part IV,
    Item 15: Note 9 of the “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements” for additional details.

JV Partners’ Share of Debt is defined as total debt less
    our share of total debt. See footnote 1 to the
    Capitalization Ratios table contained in Part II,
    Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operation —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of why we
    believe our share of total debt is a useful supplemental measure
    for our management and investors, of ways to use this measure
    when assessing our financial performance, the limitations of the
    measure as a measurement tool, and for a reconciliation of our
    share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial
    measure.

Unconsolidated
    Joint Ventures:

As of December 31, 2006, we held interests in
    14 equity investment joint ventures that are not
    consolidated in our financial statements. Effective
    October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P. on a prospective basis. The
    management and control over significant aspects of these
    investments are held by the third-party joint-venture partners
    and we are not the primary beneficiary for the investments that
    meet the variable-interest entity consolidation criteria under
    FASB Interpretation

Secured
    Debt

As of December 31, 2006, we had $1.4 billion of
    secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by
    deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2006, the
    total gross consolidated investment value of those properties
    securing the debt was $2.6 billion. Of the
    $1.4 billion of secured indebtedness, $1.0 billion was
    consolidated joint venture debt secured by properties with a
    gross investment value of $1.9 billion. For additional
    details, see Part II, Item 7: “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and
    Part IV, Item 15: Note 6 of “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this report.
    We believe that as of December 31, 2006, the fair value of
    the properties securing the respective obligations in each case
    exceeded the principal amount of the outstanding obligations.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

As of December 31, 2006, there were no pending legal
    proceedings to which we were a party or of which any of our
    properties was the subject, the adverse determination of which
    we anticipate would have a material adverse effect upon our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Item 4.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

None.


PART II

    factors, including our cash flow, financial condition and
    capital requirements, real estate investment trust provisions of
    the Internal Revenue Code and other factors.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

GENERAL

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations in
    conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial
    statements.

We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate
    company effective with the completion of our initial public
    offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a
    real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860
    of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with our
    initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997.
    AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed
    shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering.

Management’s
    Overview

The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received
    from customers under long-term (generally three to ten years)
    operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements
    from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership
    distributions and fees from our private capital business. We
    also produce earnings from the disposition of operating assets
    that no longer fit our strategy, from the disposition of
    projects in our

development-for-sale

program and from the contributions of properties to our
    co-investment joint ventures. Our long-term growth is driven by
    our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase
    rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue
    to acquire and develop new properties.

National industrial markets continued to improve during 2006
    when compared with market conditions in 2005. According to Torto
    Wheaton Research, availability dropped 10 basis points in
    the fourth quarter of 2006 to 9.4%, and availability for the
    year dropped 50 basis points. We believe the strongest
    industrial markets in the U.S. are the coastal gateway
    markets tied to global trade, including Los Angeles, our largest
    market, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, and
    to a lesser degree Northern New Jersey/New York (with the
    exception of the Exit 8A submarket). While we believe that the
    broader Chicago market is showing signs of stabilization,
    certain submarkets, like the O’Hare submarket, are
    relatively strong. We believe Dallas continues to recover, and
    Atlanta continues to suffer from a large increase in supply. We
    believe the operating environment in our U.S. on-tarmac
    business remains good with improving cargo volumes and
    essentially no new supply.

Investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our
    observation of strong national sales volumes and declining
    acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently
    strong over the past several years. We believe we capitalized on
    this demand for industrial property by accelerating the
    repositioning of our portfolio, through the disposition of
    non-core properties, which was effectively completed in 2006
    with our exit from the Charlotte and Memphis markets. We plan to
    continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis or
    that no longer fit our strategic investment objectives, but we
    believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals.

Occupancy levels in our portfolio continue to outperform the
    national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton
    Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with
    sensitivity to local market conditions. During the prior periods
    of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign
    leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent
    levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new,
    longer-term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When
    we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall
    leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different
    grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease
    term. In our stronger markets, we are increasing rents as
    opposed to occupancy.

At December 31, 2006, our operating portfolio’s
    occupancy rate was 96.1%, on an owned and managed basis (97.0%
    on a consolidated basis), an increase from both the prior
    quarter and December 31, 2005. Rental rates on lease
    renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.1% in the
    fourth quarter of 2006 and decreased 0.1% for the full year.
    Cash basis same store net operating income (rental revenues less
    property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties
    included in the same store pool, which is set annually and
    excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after
    December 31, 2004) grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter
    of 2006 and 2.6% for the full-year 2006, on an owned and managed
    basis. Excluding lease termination fees, same store net
    operating income grew 3.0% and 3.2% in the quarter and for the
    full year (decreased 0.5% and increased 1.6%, respectively, on a
    consolidated basis), respectively, on an owned and managed
    basis. See Part II, Item 7: “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Supplemental Earnings Measures” for
    a discussion of same store net operating income and a
    reconciliation of same store net operating income and net
    income. We currently expect that same store growth in our
    operating portfolio, excluding lease termination fees, will be
    about 3% to 4% for 2007, on an owned and managed basis. Market
    rents continue to rebound from their lows and in many of our hub
    and gateway markets are back to or above their prior peak levels
    of 2001.

We believe that industrial market rents in the
    San Francisco Bay Area are improving. While market rents in
    the San Francisco Bay Area were up 10% to 15% in 2006,
    rents still have not yet fully recovered to normal levels. Rents
    on lease renewals and rollovers in the San Francisco Bay
    Area declined 21.0% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 13.2% for
    the full-year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Without the
    effect of the San Francisco Bay Area, rents on renewals and
    rollovers for the full-year 2006 would have been 2.0%, on an
    owned and managed basis, which we believe reflects the generally
    positive trends in U.S. industrial space availability.

We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings
    growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and
    contribute completed development projects into our co-investment
    program and recognize development profits. We believe that
    development, renovation and expansion of well-located, high-


quality industrial properties should generally continue to
    provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher
    rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing
    properties. We believe that our development opportunities in
    Mexico, Japan and China are particularly attractive given the
    current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution
    facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries.
    Prior to our global expansion, our development pipeline was
    $106.8 million at the end of 2002. As a result of our
    global expansion and increased development capabilities, we have
    increased our development pipeline to approximately
    $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition to our
    committed development pipeline, we hold a total of
    1,735 acres for future development or sale, of which 92% is
    in North America. We believe these 1,735 acres of land
    could support approximately 30.5 million square feet of
    future development.

Going forward, we believe that our co-investment program with
    private-capital investors will continue to serve as a
    significant source of revenues and capital for new investments.
    Through these co-investment joint ventures, we typically earn
    acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority
    distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive
    distributions based on the performance of the co-investment
    joint ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will
    continue to do so. Through contribution of development
    properties to our co-investment joint ventures, we expect to
    recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of
    December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million
    square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and
    development portfolio) through our consolidated and
    unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures. We may make
    additional investments through these co-investment joint
    ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan
    to do so.

By the end of 2010, we expect to have approximately 50% of our
    owned and managed operating portfolio invested in

non-U.S. markets

(based on owned and managed annualized base rent). As of
    December 31, 2006, our

non-U.S. operating

properties comprised 14.1% of our owned and managed operating
    portfolio (based on annualized base rent) and 7.4% of our
    consolidated operating portfolio (based on annualized base
    rent). Our North American target countries outside of the United
    States currently comprise Canada and Mexico. Our European target
    countries currently comprise Belgium, France, Germany, Italy,
    the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our Asian target
    countries currently comprise China, India, Japan, Singapore and
    South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries
    outside the United States in the future.

To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust,
    we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually
    at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely
    on retained earnings to fund our on-going operations to the same
    extent that other corporations that are not real estate
    investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both
    the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs,
    acquisitions and developments. See “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” for a complete discussion of the sources of our
    capital.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
    of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements,
    which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The
    preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our
    assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our
    estimates on historical experience and on various other
    assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
    judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
    that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions. We believe the following critical accounting
    policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates
    used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless
    circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which
    case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated
    fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or
    below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs
    for all new acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or
    liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting
    purposes are reviewed for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period
    in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property
    is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property
    over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. As a
    result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we
    re-evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded
    impairment charges of $6.3 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2006 on certain of our investments.

Revenue Recognition.

We record rental revenue
    from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of
    the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that
    may result from the inability of our customers to make required
    payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments
    that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts,
    security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to
    recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods.
    We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers
    on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial condition
    periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our
    outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents,
    for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also
    record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a
    definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the
    termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be
    met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains
    in the leased space following the execution of a definitive
    termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are
    deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s
    occupancy.

Property Dispositions.

We report real estate
    dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated
    statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our
    interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the
    sale represent the interests acquired by third-party investors
    for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real
    estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we
    dispose of value-added conversion projects and

build-to-suit

and speculative development projects for which we have not
    generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or
    loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is
    reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are
    included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement
    of operations. Lastly,


Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of

Long-Lived

Assets,

requires us to separately report as discontinued
    operations the historical operating results attributable to
    operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the
    disposition of the properties, which is included in gains from
    dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests, in the
    statement of operations. The consolidated statements of
    operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with
    this classification. There is no impact on our previously
    reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash
    flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the
    full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to
    transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full
    accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when
    the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met.

Joint Ventures.

We hold interests in both
    consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine
    consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF

04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

or FASB
    Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities

“FIN 46”. Based on the
    guidance set forth in EITF

04-5,

we
    consolidate certain joint venture investments because we
    exercise significant control over major operating decisions,
    such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers,
    asset management, investment activity and changes in financing.
    For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as
    defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary
    beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for
    financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures under EITF

04-5,

where
    we do not exercise significant control over major operating and
    management decisions, but where we exercise significant
    influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not
    consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes.

Real Estate Investment Trust.

As a real estate
    investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate
    level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum
    distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some
    of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes.
    In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes
    of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be
    estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real
    estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities.
    A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences
    in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and
    gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an
    immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet.

CONSOLIDATED
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective
    basis, due to the re-evaluation of the accounting for our
    investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership
    agreement regarding the general partner’s rights effective
    October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations
    presented below are not comparable between years presented.

The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store
    growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures.
    Same store properties are those that we owned during both the
    current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development
    properties stabilized after December 31, 2004 (generally
    defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for
    which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building
    has been substantially complete for at least 12 months).

As of December 31, 2006, same store industrial properties
    consisted of properties aggregating approximately
    71.2 million square feet. The properties acquired during
    2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately
    6.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during
    2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately
    6.9 million square feet. During 2006, property divestitures
    and contributions consisted of 50 buildings, aggregating
    approximately 7.5 million square feet. In 2005, property
    divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings,
    aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. Our
    future financial condition and results of operations, including
    rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of
    additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and
    expenses may vary materially from historical results.

U.S. industrial same store revenues increased
    $13.4 million from the prior year despite the decrease of
    $12.8 million in same store revenues due to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to
    improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various
    markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41
    buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square
    feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73
    buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square
    feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from
    properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint
    venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued
    operations in our consolidated financial statements, and
    development projects that have reached certain levels of
    operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool
    of properties.

Non-U.S. industrial

revenues increased approximately $29.4 million from the
    prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three
    properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties
    in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in private capital
    income was primarily due to increased asset management and
    acquisition fees from additional assets held in co-investment
    joint ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in
    incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million.
    During 2006, we received


incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which
    $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as
    compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the
    sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during
    2005.

Same store properties’ operating expenses increased
    $6.5 million from the prior year, despite the decrease of
    $2.5 million in same store operating expenses due to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P., effective October 1, 2006, due primarily to increased
    insurance costs, utility expenses, repair and maintenance
    expenses, and other non-reimbursable expenses. The 2005
    acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating
    approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006
    acquisitions consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating
    approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial
    expenses include expenses from divested properties that have
    been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and
    accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our
    consolidated financial statements, and development properties
    that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet
    part of the same store operating pool of properties.

Non-U.S. industrial

revenues increased approximately $6.0 million from the
    prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three
    properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties
    in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and
    amortization expense was due to the increase in our net
    investment in real estate. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on
    several non-core assets as a result of leasing activities and
    changes in the economic environment and the holding period of
    certain assets. The increase in general and administrative
    expenses was primarily due to increased

stock-based

compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to
    option and stock awards and executive departures, additional
    staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the
    acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Other expenses decreased
    approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due
    primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred
    compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. Fund
    costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third
    parties associated with our co-investment joint ventures.

The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of
    unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to gains of
    $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our
    unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures during 2006 as
    opposed to $5.5 million of such gains during 2005 and,
    effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., which resulted in an
    increase of approximately $5.1 million. These increases
    were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our
    unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in other income was
    primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase
    in property management income due to the expansion of our
    property management business. The 2005 gains from disposition of
    real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution
    of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at
    contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed
    unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB Japan
    Fund I, L.P. Development profits represent gains from the
    sale of development projects and land as part of our

development-for-sale

program. The increase in development profits was due to
    increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006.
    During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development
    projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for
    an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an
    after-tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006,
    we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with
    the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of
    $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint
    venture partner’s share. During 2006, we also contributed a
    total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated
    co-investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling
    approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into
    AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately
    0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB-SGP
    Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately
    0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel
    into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these
    contributions, we recognized an aggregate after-tax gain of
    $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in
    the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors
    for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five
    development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million
    square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million,
    resulting in an after-tax gain of $45.1 million. In
    addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of
    $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During
    2005, we also contributed one completed development project into
    an unconsolidated joint venture,

AMB-SGP

Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of
    $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in
    the contributed property acquired by the third-party

co-investor

for cash. The increase in interest expense, including
    amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on
    unsecured credit facilities and other debt.

    2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one
    retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square
    feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a
    resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these
    divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The
    multi-investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately
    5.8 million square feet. We


received cash and a distribution of an on-tarmac property, AMB
    DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in
    the fund.

U.S. industrial same store revenues increased

    for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of
    AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset

    France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in
    increased international industrial property operating costs. The
    increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the
    increase in our net investment in real estate during the year.
    The increase in general and administrative expenses was
    primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new
    initiatives, including our international and development
    expansions and the expansion of satellite offices. Other
    expenses increased approximately $2.4 million from the
    prior year due primarily to greater losses on our non-qualified
    deferred compensation plan in 2005 and an increase in certain
    deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative
    costs paid to third parties associated with our co-investment
    joint ventures.

The $7.0 million increase in equity in earnings of
    unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to a gain of
    $5.4 million from the disposition of real estate by one of
    our unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures during the


second quarter of 2005. The increase in other income was
    primarily due to increased bank interest income. The 2005 gains
    from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily
    from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange
    rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our
    newly formed unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB
    Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real
    estate interests resulted from our contribution of
    $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated
    co-investment joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. Development
    profits represent gains from the sale of development projects
    and land as part of our

development-for-sale

program. The increase in development profits was due to
    increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels
    and five development projects, aggregating approximately
    0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of
    $155.2 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of
    $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final
    proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in
    2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development
    project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico,
    LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of $1.9 million
    representing the portion of our interest in the contributed
    property acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash.
    During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development
    projects as part of our

development-for-sale

program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet
    for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an
    after-tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also
    contributed one completed development project into a newly
    formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and
    recognized an after-tax gain of $2.0 million representing
    the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired
    by the third-party co-investor for cash.

    approximately $113.6 million. Included in these
    divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance
    Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi-investor fund
    owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million
    square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on-tarmac
    property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our
    21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of
    21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office
    building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square
    feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a
    resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Balance Sheet Strategy.

In general, we use
    unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and
    common equity (issued by us

and/or

the
    operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our
    100%-owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non-recourse,
    secured debt encumbering our 100%-owned assets and replace that
    debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co-investment joint
    ventures, in general, we use non-recourse, secured debt to
    capitalize our co-investment joint ventures.

We currently expect that our principal sources of working
    capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and
    renovation of properties will include:

•

retained earnings and cash flow from operations;


•

private capital from co-investment partners;

•

net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed
    development projects to our co-investment joint ventures;

•

borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities;

•

other forms of secured or unsecured financing;

•

proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities
    offerings;

•

proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including
    issuances of limited partnership units by our
    subsidiaries); and

•

net proceeds from divestitures of properties.

We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will
    include:

•

working capital;

•

development, expansion and renovation of properties;

•

acquisitions, including our global expansion;

•

debt service; and

•

dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred
    stock and limited partnership units.

Cash flows.

As of December 31, 2006, cash
    provided by operating activities was $335.9 million as
    compared to $295.8 million for the same period in 2005.
    This change is primarily due to increases in rental rates,
    partially offset by an increase in general and administrative
    expenses primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for
    new initiatives, including our international and development
    expansions and increased occupancy costs related to the
    expansion of regional offices. Cash used for investing
    activities was $880.6 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used for investing
    activities of $60.4 million for the same period in 2005.
    This change is primarily due to an increase in funds used for
    property acquisitions and capital expenditures, and a decrease
    in proceeds from property divestitures (mainly due to the
    divesture of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P.,
    portfolio in 2005), offset by less funds used for additions to
    interests in unconsolidated joint ventures and an increase in
    capital distributions received from unconsolidated joint
    ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was
    $483.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    as compared to cash used in financing activities of
    $101.9 million for the same period in 2005. This change is
    due primarily to an increase in borrowings, net of repayments,
    issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and
    issuances of preferred stock, offset by the cost of the
    repurchase of preferred units for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our
    cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our
    unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private
    and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet
    our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The
    unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

Capital
    Resources

Property Divestitures.

During 2006, we
    divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating
    approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate
    price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of
    $42.6 million.

Development Sales.

During 2006, we sold five
    land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately
    1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of
    $86.6 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of
    $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received
    approximately $0.4 million in connection with the
    condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of
    $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint
    venture partner’s share.


Development Contributions.

During 2006, we
    contributed a total of nine completed development projects and
    one land parcel into unconsolidated co-investment joint
    ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million
    square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P,
    two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet
    were contributed into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and three projects
    totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were
    contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.
    In addition, one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS
    Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we
    recognized an aggregate after-tax gain of $94.1 million,
    representing the portion of our interest in the contributed
    property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. These
    gains are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the
    statement of operations.

Properties Held for Contribution.

As of
    December 31, 2006, we held for contribution to
    co-investment joint ventures, nine industrial projects with an
    aggregate net book value of $154.0 million, which, when
    contributed to a joint venture, will reduce our current
    ownership interest from approximately 100% to an expected range
    of

15-50%.

Properties Held for Divestiture.

As of
    December 31, 2006, we held for divestiture four industrial
    projects, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our
    current strategic objectives or which we have included as part
    of our

development-for-sale

program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to
    negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions.
    As of December 31, 2006, the net carrying value of the
    properties held for divestiture was $20.9 million. Expected
    net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the
    properties.

Co-investment Joint Ventures.

Through the
    operating partnership, we enter into co-investment joint
    ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment joint
    ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us
    with an additional source of capital to fund certain
    acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as
    well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these
    joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are
    not variable interest entities and because we are the sole
    managing general partner and control all major operating
    decisions. However, in certain cases, our co-investment joint
    ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major
    operating decisions and the general partners do not have
    significant rights under EITF

04-5.

Third-party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected
    as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements.
    As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately
    64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the
    total operating and development portfolio) through our
    consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make
    additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint
    ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Our
    consolidated co-investment joint ventures at December 31,

We also have a 0.1% unconsolidated equity interest (with an
    approximate 33% economic interest) in AMB Pier One, LLC, a joint
    venture related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier which
    houses our office space in the San Francisco Bay Area. The
    investment is not consolidated because we do not exercise
    control over major operating decisions such as approval of
    budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and
    changes in financing. We have an option to purchase the
    remaining equity interest beginning January 1, 2007 and
    expiring December 31, 2009, based on the fair market value
    as stipulated in the joint venture agreement. As of
    December 31, 2006, we also had an approximate 39.0%
    unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real
    estate company. G.Accion provides management and development
    services for industrial, retail, residential and office
    properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2006,
    one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in
    IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income
    trust specializing in aviation-related real estate at
    Canada’s leading international airports. This equity
    investment is included in other assets on the consolidated
    balance sheets.

On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a
    partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited

    from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5%
    Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on
    July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem
    all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable
    Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all
    accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date.

In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two-year
    common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to
    $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase
    or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Debt.

In order to maintain financial
    flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through
    market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share
    of total

debt-to-our

share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45%
    or less. As of December 31, 2006, our share of total

debt-to-our

share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.2%. (See
    footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our
    definitions of “our share of total market
    capitalization,” “market equity” and “our
    share of total debt.”) However, we typically finance our
    co-investment joint ventures with secured debt at a

loan-to-value

ratio of

50-65% per

our joint venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend
    to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment
    grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these
    policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the
    amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our
    management could alter or eliminate these policies without
    stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could
    render us unable to comply with these policies.

As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate principal amount of
    our secured debt was $1.4 billion, excluding unamortized
    debt premiums of $6.3 million. Of the $1.4 billion of
    secured debt, $1.0 billion is secured by properties in our
    joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non-recourse and
    bears interest at rates varying from 2.9% to 10.4% per
    annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.2%) and final maturity
    dates ranging from February 2007 to January 2025. As of
    December 31, 2006, $1.0 billion of the secured debt
    obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average
    interest rate of 6.1%, while the remaining $386.1 million
    bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average
    interest rate of 4.7%).

As of December 31, 2006, the operating partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.1 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 6.2% and had a weighted average term of 4.8 years.
    These unsecured senior debt securities include
    $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998,
    $225.0 million of medium-term notes, which were issued
    under the operating partnership’s 2000 medium-term note
    program, $275.0 million of medium-term notes, which were
    issued under the operating partnership’s 2002 medium-term
    note program, $175.0 million of medium-term notes, which
    were issued under the operating partnership’s 2006 medium
    term-note program and approximately $112.5 million of
    5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers
    Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11,
    2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of
    $100.0 million of notes that were issued in June 1998
    resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The
    unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various
    covenants. Also included is a $25.0 million promissory note
    which matures in January 2007.

We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with
    respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to
    refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay
    them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our
    cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our
    stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity.
    Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at
    the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to
    make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest
    rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to
    that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased
    interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition,
    results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends
    on, and the market price of, our stock.

Credit Facilities.

On June 1, 2006, the
    operating partnership entered into a third amended and restated
    $550.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement that
    replaced its then-existing $500.0 million credit facility,
    which was to mature on June 1, 2007. We are a guarantor of
    the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit
    facility. The line, which matures on June 1, 2010, carries
    a one-year extension option and can be increased to up to


$700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the
    operating partnership’s long-term debt rating, which was
    42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an
    annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four-year
    credit facility includes a multi-currency component, under which
    up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars,
    Euros, Yen or British Pounds Sterling. The operating partnership
    uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions,
    funding development activity and general working capital
    requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding
    balance on the credit facility was $303.7 million and the
    remaining amount available was $234.6 million, net of
    outstanding letters of credit of $11.7 million. The
    outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros,
    which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31,
    2006, equaled approximately $303.7 million
    U.S. dollars.

On June 23, 2006, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of
    the operating partnership and as the initial borrower, entered
    into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a
    45.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility,
    which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31,
    2006, equaled approximately $377.9 million
    U.S. dollars. This replaced the 35.0 billion Yen
    unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 29,
    2004, as previously amended, which using the exchange rate in
    effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately
    $293.9 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the
    operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan
    Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the
    obligations of any other entity in which the operating
    partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest
    and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under
    and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to
    use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and
    development of properties and for other real estate purposes in
    Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the
    credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of
    the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real
    estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate
    assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a
    one-year extension option. The credit facility can be increased
    to up to 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate
    in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately
    $461.9 million U.S. dollars. The extension option is
    subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the
    payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding
    commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on
    the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term
    debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31,
    2006. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in
    quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the
    operating partnership’s long-term debt, and was 15 basis
    points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of
    December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange
    rate in effect on December 31, 2006, was
    $320.9 million in U.S. dollars.

On June 13, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of
    its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and
    restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured
    revolving credit facility, which replaced the third amended and
    restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured
    credit facility. On February 16, 2006, the third amended
    and restated credit agreement replaced the then-existing
    $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was
    to mature in June 2008. We, along with the operating
    partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and
    other entities controlled by us or the operating partnership
    that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time
    to be borrowers under and pursuant to the credit facility. The
    four-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component
    under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in
    U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars,
    Canadian dollars and Euros. The line, which matures in February
    2010 and carries a one-year extension option, can be increased
    to up to $350.0 million upon certain conditions and the
    payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding
    commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus
    a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating
    partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt, which was 60
    basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual
    facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating
    partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. The
    borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund
    the acquisition and development of properties and general
    working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the
    outstanding balance on this facility was approximately
    $227.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating
    partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on
    the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or
    consolidations.


Mortgages Receivable.

Through a wholly owned
    subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One,
    LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at
    13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2006, the
    outstanding balance on the note was $12.7 million. We also
    hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint
    venture totaling $6.1 million with an interest rate of
    10.0%. The loan matures in March 2010.

Our definition of “total market capitalization” is
    total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus
    market equity. Our definition of “our share of total market
    capitalization” is our share of total debt plus preferred
    equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. Our
    definition of “market equity” is the total number of
    outstanding shares of our common stock and common limited
    partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of
    our common stock as of December 31, 2006. Our definition of
    “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation
    preferences. Our share of total book capitalization is defined
    as our share of total debt plus minority interests to preferred
    unitholders and limited partnership unitholders plus
    stockholders’ equity. Our share of total debt is the pro
    rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity
    interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated ventures
    holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a
    meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management
    and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our
    leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for
    a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other
    companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our
    share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual
    liability should there be a default under any or all of such
    loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a
    reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated
    debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt
    maturities and capitalization above.


Liquidity

As of December 31, 2006, we had $174.8 million in cash
    and cash equivalents and $314.2 million of additional
    available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had $21.1 million in restricted
    cash.

Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the

    common stock, and the operating partnership announced its
    intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter
    ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per common unit. The
    dividends and distributions were payable on January 5, 2007
    to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22,
    2006. The series L, M, O and P preferred stock dividends
    were payable on January 16, 2007 to stockholders of record
    on January 5, 2007. The series J and K preferred unit
    quarterly distributions were payable on January 16, 2007.
    The series D and I preferred unit quarterly distributions

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from
    operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it
    comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with
    net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as
    property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain
    future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to
    obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price
    of, our stock.

Capital
    Commitments

Development Starts.

During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, we initiated 30 new industrial
    development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a
    total expected investment of $914.3 million, aggregating
    approximately 10.4 million square feet. During 2005, we
    initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North
    America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of
    $522.4 million, aggregating approximately 7.0 million
    square feet.


Development Pipeline.

As of December 31,
    2006, we had 45 industrial projects in our development pipeline,
    which will total approximately 13.7 million square feet,
    and will have an aggregate estimated investment of
    $1.3 billion upon completion. We have an additional ten
    development projects available for sale or contribution totaling
    approximately 3.0 million square feet, with an aggregate
    estimated investment of $199.2 million. One of these ten
    projects totaling $13.0 million and approximately
    0.2 million square feet is held in an unconsolidated joint
    venture. As of December 31, 2006, we and our joint venture
    partners had funded an aggregate of $814.5 million and
    needed to fund an estimated additional $481.0 million in
    order to complete our development pipeline which includes
    projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of
    2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006,
    we acquired 835 acres of land for industrial warehouse
    development in North America and Asia for approximately
    $293.2 million.

Acquisitions.

During 2006, we acquired 106
    industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 9.8 million
    square feet for a total expected investment of
    $834.2 million (includes acquisition costs of
    $814.1 million and estimated acquisition capital of
    $20.1 million), of which we acquired 70 buildings through
    one of our unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures. We
    generally fund our acquisitions through private capital
    contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash,
    debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures.

Lease Commitments.

We have entered into
    operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily
    on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms
    from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements are
    amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related
    leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required
    under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of
    December 31, 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Co-investment Joint Ventures.

Through the
    operating partnership, we enter into co-investment joint
    ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment joint
    ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us
    with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions,
    development projects and renovation projects, as well as private
    capital income. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments
    in co-investment joint ventures with a gross book value of
    $1.9 billion, which are consolidated for financial
    reporting purposes, and net equity investments in four
    unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures of
    $236.0 million and a gross book value of $2.5 billion.
    As of December 31, 2006, we may make additional capital
    contributions to current and planned co-investment joint
    ventures of up to $168.2 million (using the exchange rates
    at December 31, 2006) pursuant to the terms of the
    joint venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise
    additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P., an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment
    joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which
    invests through a private real estate investment trust. This
    would increase our obligation to make additional capital
    commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement
    of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total
    equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity
    commitment is greater than $150.0 million, at which time,
    our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity
    commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash
    from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or
    equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures,
    which could adversely effect our cash flow.

Captive Insurance Company.

In December 2001,
    we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd., (Arcata), which provides insurance
    coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible
    under our third-party policies. The captive insurance company is
    one element of our overall risk management program. We
    capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory
    requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of our
    properties. Annually,


we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial
    estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and
    projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management
    programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this
    estimate. Like premiums paid to third-party insurance companies,
    premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant
    to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we believe that
    we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall
    lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market.

Potential Contingent and Unknown
    Liabilities.

Contingent and unknown liabilities
    may include the following:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our
    predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions
    that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition
    transactions;

•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
    of business;

•

tax liabilities; and

•

claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our
    predecessors and others indemnified by these entities.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Standby Letters of Credit.

As of
    December 31, 2006, we had provided approximately
    $22.1 million in letters of credit, of which
    $11.7 million was provided under the operating
    partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit
    facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under
    certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other
    commitments.

Guarantees.

Other than parent guarantees
    associated with the unsecured debt, as of December 31,

,

we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate
    amount of $48.2 million in connection with certain
    acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed
    $26.8 million and $83.2 million on outstanding loans
    on two of our consolidated joint ventures and two of our
    unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. In addition, as of
    December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $87.3 million on
    outstanding property debt related to one of our unconsolidated
    joint ventures.

Performance and Surety Bonds.

As of
    December 31, 2006, we had outstanding performance and
    surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $11.4 million. These
    bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development
    projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations
    and the construction of certain real property improvements and
    infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance
    and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from
    real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are
    renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the
    completion of the improvements and infrastructure.

Promoted Interests and Other Contractual
    Obligations.

Upon the achievement of certain
    return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may
    be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture
    partners


pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual
    agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of
    our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties
    that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform
    other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.

SUPPLEMENTAL
    EARNINGS MEASURES

FFO.

We believe that net income, as defined by
    GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we
    consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the
    National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT),
    to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating
    performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in
    accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions
    of real estate held for investment purposes and real
    estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro
    rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint
    ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects
    of non-recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by
    NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating
    performance because historical cost accounting for real estate
    assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value
    of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as
    reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses.
    However, since real estate values have historically risen or
    fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors
    and analysts have considered presentation of operating results
    for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to
    be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental
    measure of operating performance for real estate investment
    trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and
    amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by
    GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required
    GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the
    understanding of operating results of real estate investment
    trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of
    operating results among such companies more meaningful. We
    consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our
    comparative operating and financial performance because, by
    excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously
    depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate
    depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public
    compare the operating performance of a company’s real
    estate between periods or as compared to other companies.

While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating
    performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not
    represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by
    GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those
    measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance.
    FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital
    expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO
    necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash
    requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be
    comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment
    trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the
    current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT
    definition differently than we do.

The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled
    from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in

SS NOI.

We believe that net income, as defined
    by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we
    consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, to be a
    useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For
    properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see
    Part I, Item 2: “Properties —
    Industrial Properties — Owned and Managed Market
    Operating Statistics”, Note 6, and “Owned and
    Managed Operating and Leasing Statistics — Owned and
    Managed Same Store Operating Statistics”, Note 2. In
    deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated
    in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less
    straight-line rents, property operating expenses and real estate
    taxes. We exclude straight-line rents in calculating SS NOI
    because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash
    basis rental growth for a

year-over-year

comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the
    investing public compare the operating performance of a
    company’s real estate as compared to other companies.

While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating
    performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not
    represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by
    GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those
    measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance.
    SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense,
    interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital
    expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and
    construction activities that could materially impact our results
    from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be
    comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may
    use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market
    prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our
    future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing
    market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching
    projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing
    activities with projected cash outflows for debt service,
    acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to
    stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The
    majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which
    minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to
    market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection
    with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings
    and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval,
    thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could
    adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2006,
    we had three outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate
    notional amount of $38.1 million (in U.S. dollars).
    See “Financial Instruments” below.

The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our
    fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized
    debt discounts of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2006

If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased
    or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest
    expense on the variable rate debt would be $4.9 million
    (net of swaps) annually. As of December 31,


2006, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total
    consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 and
    $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of
    current market interest rates.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, variable rate debt
    comprised 37.1% and 24.5%, respectively, of all our outstanding
    debt. Variable rate debt was $1.3 billion and
    $831.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006
    and 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding
    balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our
    outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated
    with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations.

Financial Instruments.

We record all
    derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in
    non-functional currencies, we may use derivative financial
    instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our
    derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31,
    2006 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our
    variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD) and
    Euribor (Europe).

International Operations.

Our exposure to
    market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk.
    The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our
    subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The
    functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the
    United States is generally the local currency of the country in
    which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign
    exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional
    currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial
    statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are
    translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial
    statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the
    average exchange rate for the period and significant
    nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction
    date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component
    of stockholders’ equity and totaled $0.2 million for
    year ended December 31, 2006.

Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated
    in currencies other than their functional currency. In these
    instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at
    the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities
    are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the
    period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the
    average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, losses from remeasurement and the sale
    of four foreign exchange agreements included in our results of
    operations totaled $0.8 million.

We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a
    transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other
    than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and the
    functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than
    expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the
    transaction was initiated.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures and Changes to Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

As required by

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried
    out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the
    design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    that were in effect as of the end of the year covered by this
    report. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
    each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective at a reasonable assurance level as of
    December 31, 2006.

No changes were made in our internal control over financial
    reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
    under the supervision of, the chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer and effected by our board of directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    includes those policies and procedures that:

(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in
    reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
    involving our assets;

(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
    made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
    and directors; and

(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
    and compliance, and is subject to lapses in judgment and
    breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
    financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or
    improper management override. Because of such limitations, there
    is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
    reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
    features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is
    possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
    not eliminate, this risk.

Our management has used the framework set forth in the report
    entitled “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
    Based on our evaluation under the framework in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework,” our management
    has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
    was effective as of December 31, 2006.


Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 has been audited by our independent
    registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
    as stated in their report which appears herein.

Respectfully,

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of AMB Property Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of AMB Property
    Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
    opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of AMB Property
    Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. These financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, on
    January 1, 2006.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
    based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance

F-1

with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
    and expenditures of the company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2006 and 2005

1.

Organization
    and Formation of the Company

AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the
    “Company”), commenced operations as a fully integrated
    real estate company effective with the completion of its initial
    public offering on November 26, 1997. The Company elected
    to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under
    Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986 as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its
    taxable year ended December 31, 1997, and believes its
    current organization and method of operation will enable it to
    maintain its status as a REIT. The Company, through its
    controlling interest in its subsidiary, AMB Property, L.P., a
    Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating
    Partnership”), is engaged in the acquisition, development
    and operation of industrial properties in key distribution
    markets throughout North America, Europe and Asia. The Company
    uses the terms “industrial properties” or
    “industrial buildings” to describe various types of
    industrial properties in its portfolio and uses these terms
    interchangeably with the following: logistics facilities,
    centers or warehouses; distribution facilities, centers or
    warehouses; High Throughput
    Distribution

®

(HTD

®

) facilities;
    or any combination of these terms. The Company uses the term
    “owned and managed” to describe assets in which it has
    at least a 10% ownership interest, for which it is the property
    or asset manager, and which it intends to hold for the
    long-term. Unless the context otherwise requires, the
    “Company” means AMB Property Corporation, the
    Operating Partnership and their other controlled subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company owned an approximate
    95.0% general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership,
    excluding preferred units. The remaining approximate 5.0% common
    limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated
    investors and certain current and former directors and officers
    of the Company. As the sole general partner of the Operating
    Partnership, the Company has full, exclusive and complete
    responsibility and discretion in the

day-to-day

management and control of the Operating Partnership. Net
    operating results of the Operating Partnership are allocated
    after preferred unit distributions based on the respective
    partners’ ownership interests. Certain properties are owned
    by the Company through limited partnerships, limited liability
    companies and other entities. The ownership of such properties
    through such entities does not materially affect the
    Company’s overall ownership interests in the properties.

Through the Operating Partnership, the Company enters into
    co-investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These
    co-investment joint ventures provide the Company with an
    additional source of capital and income. As of December 31,
    2006, the Company had investments in five consolidated and four
    unconsolidated

co-investment

joint ventures. Effective October 1, 2006, the Company
    deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.,
    an open-ended co-investment partnership formed in 2004 with
    institutional investors, on a prospective basis, due to the
    re-evaluation of the Company’s accounting for its
    investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership
    agreement regarding the general partner’s rights effective
    October 1, 2006.

Any references to the number of buildings, square footage,
    customers and occupancy in the financial statement footnotes are
    unaudited.

AMB Capital Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
    (“AMB Capital Partners”), provides real estate
    investment services to clients on a fee basis. Headlands Realty
    Corporation, a Maryland corporation, conducts a variety of
    businesses that include development projects available for sale
    or contribution to third parties and incremental income
    programs. IMD Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
    conducts a variety of businesses that also includes development
    projects available for sale or contribution to third parties.
    AMB Capital Partners, Headlands Realty Corporation and IMD
    Holding Corporation are wholly-owned direct or indirect
    subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company owned or had
    investments in, on a consolidated basis or through
    unconsolidated joint ventures, properties and development
    projects expected to total approximately 124.7 million
    rentable square feet (11.6 million square meters) and 1,108
    buildings in 39 markets within twelve countries. Additionally,
    as of December 31, 2006, the Company managed, but did not
    have a significant ownership interest in,

F-7

AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006 and 2005

industrial and other properties, totaling approximately
    1.5 million rentable square feet. The Company’s
    investment strategy generally targets customers whose business
    is tied to global trade, which according to the World Trade
    Organization, has grown more than three times the world domestic
    product growth rate during the last 20 years. To serve the
    facility needs of these customers, the Company seeks to invest
    in major distribution markets, transportation hubs and gateways,
    that generally are tied to global trade, both in the U.S. and
    internationally.

Of the approximately 124.7 million rentable square feet as
    of December 31, 2006:

•

on an owned and managed basis, which include investments held on
    a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint ventures,
    the Company owned or partially owned 964 industrial buildings,
    principally warehouse distribution buildings, encompassing
    approximately 100.7 million rentable square feet that were
    96.1% leased;

•

on an owned and managed basis, which include investments held on
    an unconsolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint
    ventures, the Company had investments in 45 industrial
    development projects which are expected to total approximately
    13.7 million rentable square feet upon completion;

•

on a consolidated basis, the Company owned nine development
    projects, totaling approximately 2.7 million rentable
    square feet that are available for sale or contribution; and

•

through other non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, the
    Company had investments in 46 industrial operating properties,
    totaling approximately 7.4 million rentable square feet,
    and one industrial operating property, totaling approximately
    0.2 million square feet which is available for sale or
    contribution.

2.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows of the Company, its wholly-owned
    qualified REIT and taxable REIT subsidiaries, the Operating
    Partnership and joint ventures, in which the Company has a
    controlling interest. Third-party equity interests in the
    Operating Partnership and joint ventures are reflected as
    minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. The
    Company also has non-controlling partnership interests in
    unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, which are accounted
    for under the equity method. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications.

Certain items in the
    consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been
    reclassified to conform to current classifications.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless
    circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which
    case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated
    fair value. The Company also regularly reviews the impact of
    above or below-market leases, in-place leases and lease
    origination costs for all new acquisitions, and records an
    intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for
    financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of

F-8

AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006 and 2005

the Company’s long-lived assets could occur in the future
    period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a
    property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the
    property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings.
    As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment,
    the Company re-evaluated the carrying value of its investments
    and recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million during the
    year ended December 31, 2006 on certain of its investments.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local airport

The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase
    price of the property or interest in property, including legal
    fees and acquisition costs. Project costs directly associated
    with the development and construction of a real estate project,
    which include interest and property taxes, are capitalized as
    construction in progress. Capitalized interest related to
    construction projects for the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004 was $42.9 million, $29.5 million
    and $18.7 million, respectively.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Maintenance expenditures include
    painting and repair costs. The Company expenses costs as
    incurred and does not accrue in advance of planned major
    maintenance activities. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic useful life of assets are capitalized
    and include parking lot, HVAC and roof replacement costs.

Investments in Consolidated and Unconsolidated Joint
    Ventures.

Minority interests represent the
    limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and
    interests held by certain third parties in several real estate
    joint ventures, which own properties aggregating approximately
    36.1 million square feet, which are consolidated for
    financial reporting purposes. Such investments are consolidated
    because the Company exercises significant control over major
    operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of
    property managers, asset management, investment activity and
    changes in financing.

The Company holds interests in both consolidated and
    unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company determines
    consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF

Certain Rights or FASB Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

“FIN 46”. Based on the guidance set forth in
    EITF

04-5,

the Company consolidates certain joint venture investments
    because it exercises significant control over major operating
    decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property
    managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in
    financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest
    entities as defined under FIN 46 where the Company is not
    the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the joint
    venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures
    under EITF

04-5,

where
    the Company does not exercise significant control over major
    operating and management decisions, but where it exercises
    significant influence, the Company uses the equity method of
    accounting and does not consolidate the joint venture for
    financial reporting purposes.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
    Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity

(“SFAS 150”). This Statement establishes
    standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
    financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities
    and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial
    instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset
    in some circumstances). SFAS 150 was effective beginning in
    the third quarter of 2003; however, the FASB deferred the
    implementation of SFAS 150 as it applied to certain
    minority interests in finite-lived entities indefinitely. The
    disclosure requirements for certain minority interests in
    finite-lived entities still apply. The Company adopted the
    requirements of SFAS 150 in the third quarter of 2003, and,
    considering the aforementioned deferral, there was no impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows. However, the minority interests associated with
    certain of the Company’s consolidated joint ventures, that
    have finite lives under the terms of the partnership agreements
    represent mandatorily redeemable interests as defined in
    SFAS 150. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    aggregate book value of these minority interests in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet was $555.2 million
    and $853.6 million, respectively, and the Company believes
    that the aggregate settlement value of these interests was
    approximately $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion,
    respectively. This amount is based on the estimated liquidation
    values of the assets and liabilities and the resulting proceeds
    that the Company would distribute to its joint venture partners
    upon dissolution, as required under the terms of the respective
    partnership agreements. Subsequent changes to the estimated fair
    values of the assets and liabilities of the consolidated joint
    ventures will affect the Company’s estimate of the
    aggregate settlement value. The partnership agreements do not
    limit the amount that the minority partners would be entitled to
    in the event of liquidation of the assets and liabilities and
    dissolution of the respective partnerships.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with property purchases,
    Section 1031 exchange accounts and debt or real estate tax
    payments.

Mortgages and Loans Receivable.

Through a
    wholly-owned subsidiary, the Company holds a mortgage loan
    receivable of $12.7 million on AMB Pier One, LLC, an
    unconsolidated joint venture. The Company also holds a loan
    receivable of $6.1 million on G. Accion, an unconsolidated
    investment. The book value of the mortgages approximates fair
    value.

Accounts Receivable.

Accounts receivable
    includes all current accounts receivable, net of allowances,
    other accruals and deferred rent receivable of
    $64.6 million and $66.7 million as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company
    regularly reviews the credit worthiness of its customers and
    adjusts its allowance for doubtful accounts, straight-line rent
    receivable balance and tenant improvement and leasing costs
    amortization accordingly.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

Other real
    estate companies compete with the Company in its real estate
    markets. This results in competition for customers to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Company’s ability to lease space and
    on the amount of rent received. As of

F-10

AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006 and 2005

December 31, 2006, the Company does not have any material
    concentration of credit risk due to the diversification of its
    customers.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the straight-line method over the term of
    the related loan. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    deferred financing costs were $20.4 million and
    $25.0 million, respectively, net of accumulated
    amortization.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

The Company
    has classified as goodwill the cost in excess of fair value of
    the net assets of companies acquired in purchase transactions.
    As prescribed in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 142, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”,
    (SFAS 142) goodwill and certain indefinite lived
    intangible assets, including excess reorganization value and
    certain trademarks, are no longer amortized, but are subject to
    at least annual impairment testing. The Company tests annually
    (or more often, if necessary) for impairment under
    SFAS No. 142. The Company determined that there was no
    impairment to goodwill and intangible assets during the year
    ended December 31, 2006.

Financial Instruments.

SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging
    Activities,

provides comprehensive guidelines for the
    recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging
    activities and, specifically, requires all derivatives to be
    recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income or loss. For revenues or expenses denominated in
    nonfunctional currencies, the Company may use derivative
    financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate
    risk. The Company’s derivative financial instruments in
    effect at December 31, 2006 were three interest rate swaps
    hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on
    U.S. Libor (USD) and Euribor (Europe). Adjustments to the
    fair value of these instruments for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 resulted in a gain of $0.6 million.
    This gain is included in other assets in the consolidated
    balance sheet and accumulated other comprehensive loss in the
    consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

Debt.

The Company’s debt includes both
    fixed and variable rate secured debt, unsecured fixed rate debt,
    unsecured variable rate debt and credit facilities. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Company at December 31,
    2006, the book value and the estimated fair value of the total
    debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion and
    $3.5 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the
    variable rate debt approximates fair value.

Debt Premiums.

Debt premiums represent the
    excess of the fair value of debt over the principal value of
    debt assumed in connection with the Company’s initial
    public offering and subsequent property acquisitions. The debt
    premiums are being amortized as an offset to interest expense
    over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    straight-line method. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    net unamortized debt premium was $6.3 million and
    $12.0 million, respectively, and are included as a
    component of secured debt on the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets.

Rental Revenues and Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts.

The Company, as a lessor, retains
    substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of the
    properties and accounts for its leases as operating leases.
    Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    term of the leases. Reimbursements from customers for real
    estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are
    incurred. The Company also records lease termination fees when a
    customer terminates its lease by executing a definitive
    termination agreement with the Company, vacates the premises and
    the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any
    conditions that must be met before the fee is due to the
    Company. In addition, the Company nets its allowance for
    doubtful accounts against rental income for financial reporting
    purposes. Such amounts totaled $2.9 million,
    $3.2 million and $1.8 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Private Capital Income.

Private capital income
    consists primarily of acquisition and development fees, asset
    management fees and priority distributions earned by AMB Capital
    Partners from joint ventures and clients. Private capital income
    also includes promoted interests and incentive distributions
    from the Operating Partnership’s co-investment joint
    ventures. The Company received incentive distributions of
    $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million

F-11

was from AMB Partners II, L.P., and $26.4 million for
    the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P.,
    respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005.

Other Income.

Other income consists primarily
    of interest income from mortgages receivable and on cash and
    cash equivalents.

Development Profits, Net of Taxes.

When the
    Company disposes of its real estate entities’ interests,
    gains reported from the sale of these interests represent
    either: (i) the sale of partial interests in consolidated
    co-investment joint ventures to third-party investors for cash
    or (ii) the sale of partial interests in properties to
    unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures with third-party
    investors for cash.

Gains from Dispositions of Real Estate.

Gains
    and losses are recognized using the full accrual method. Gains
    related to transactions which do not meet the requirements of
    the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and
    recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria
    are met.

Discontinued Operations.

The Company reported
    real estate dispositions as discontinued operations separately
    as prescribed under the provisions of SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets

(SFAS 144). The Company separately reports as
    discontinued operations the historical operating results
    attributable to operating properties sold and held for
    disposition and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition
    of the properties, which is included in gains from dispositions
    of real estate, net of minority interests, in the statement of
    operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior
    periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification.
    There is no impact on the Company’s previously reported
    consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows.

International Operations.

The U.S. dollar
    is the functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries
    operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional
    currency for the Company’s subsidiaries operating outside
    the United States is generally the local currency of the country
    in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of
    currency exchange gains and losses. The Company’s
    subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
    U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into
    U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the
    exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. The
    Company translates income statement accounts using the average
    exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring
    transactions using the rate on the transaction date. For the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, losses
    resulting from the translation were $0.2 million,
    $1.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively. These
    losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company’s international subsidiaries may have
    transactions denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currency. In these instances, non-monetary assets and
    liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate,
    monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange
    rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement
    accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the
    period. Gains from remeasurement were $0.8 million,
    $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the years ended
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These gains are included in
    the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company also records gains or losses in the income statement
    when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency
    other than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and
    the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less
    than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the
    transaction was initiated. These gains and losses have been
    immaterial over the past three years.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In June 2006,
    the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — An Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

.”, which clarifies the accounting and
    disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions, as defined.
    FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated
    with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related
    to accounting for income taxes. This interpretation is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Based
    on the Company’s

F-12

AMB PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006 and 2005

evaluation, which is ongoing, the Company does not believe that
    FIN 48 will have a material impact on its financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108,

“Considering
    the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,”

in
    order to address the SEC Staff’s concerns over
    registrant’s exclusive reliance on either the “iron
    curtain” or balance sheet approach or the
    “rollover” or income statement approach in quantifying
    financial statement misstatements.
    SAB No. 108 states that registrants should use
    both a balance sheet and an income statement approach when
    quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement and
    contains guidance on correcting errors under the dual approach.
    SAB No. 108 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The
    adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations.

Gains
    from Dispositions of Real Estate Interests, Development Sales
    and Discontinued Operations

Gains from Dispositions of Real Estate
    Interests.

On June 30, 2005, the Company
    formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. a joint venture with 13
    institutional investors, in which the Company retained an
    approximate 20% interest. The 13 institutional investors have
    committed 49.5 billion Yen ($415.7 million
    U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31,
    2006) for an approximate 80% equity interest. The Company
    contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect
    at contribution) in operating properties, consisting of six
    industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 0.9 million
    square feet, to this fund. During 2005, the Company recognized a
    gain of $17.8 million on the contribution, representing the
    portion of its interest in the contributed properties acquired
    by the third-party investors for cash.

On December 31, 2004, the Company formed AMB-SGP Mexico,
    LLC, a joint venture with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte Ltd, a
    subsidiary of GIC Real Estate Pte. Ltd., the real estate
    investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment
    Corporation, in which the Company retained a 20% interest.
    During 2005, the Company recognized a gain of $1.3 million
    from disposition of real estate interests, representing the
    additional value received from the contribution of properties to
    AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC.

Development Sales.

During 2006, the Company
    sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling
    approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale
    price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of
    $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, the Company
    received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the
    condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of
    $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint
    venture partner’s share.

During 2005, the Company sold five land parcels and five
    development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million
    square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million,
    resulting in an after-tax gain of $45.1 million. In
    addition, during 2005, the Company received final proceeds of
    $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004.

During 2004, the Company sold seven land parcels and six
    development projects as part of our

development-for-sale

program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet,
    for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an
    after-tax gain of $6.5 million.

Discontinued Operations.

The Company reports
    its property divestitures as discontinued operations separately
    as prescribed under the provisions of SFAS No. 144.
    Beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144 requires the Company
    to separately report as discontinued operations the historical
    operating results attributable to operating properties sold and
    held for disposition and the applicable gain or loss on the
    disposition of the properties, which is included in gains from
    dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests, in the
    statement of operations. Although the application of
    SFAS No. 144 may affect the presentation of the
    Company’s results of operations for the periods that it has
    already reported in filings with the SEC, there will be no
    effect on its previously reported financial position, net income
    or cash flows.

During 2006, the Company divested itself of 39 industrial
    buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square
    feet, for an aggregate price of $175.3 million, with a
    resulting net gain of $42.6 million.

During 2005, the Company divested itself of 142 industrial
    buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately
    9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of
    $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of

$113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale
    of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for
    $618.5 million. The multi-investor fund owned 100 buildings
    totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. The Company
    received cash and a distribution of an on-tarmac property, AMB
    DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for its 21% interest in
    the fund. The Company also received a net incentive distribution
    of approximately $26.4 million in cash which is classified
    under private capital income on the consolidated statement of
    operations.

During 2004, the Company divested itself of 21 industrial
    buildings, two retail centers and one office building,
    aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an
    aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net
    gain of $42.0 million.

Development Contributions.

During 2006, the
    Company contributed a total of nine completed development
    projects into unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures. Four
    projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet
    were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects
    totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were
    contributed into

AMB-SGP

Mexico, LLC, and three projects totaling approximately
    0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. In addition, one land
    parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a
    result of these contributions, the Company recognized an
    aggregate after-tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the
    portion of the Company’s interest in the contributed
    property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. These
    gains are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the
    statement of operations.

During 2005, The Company contributed one approximately
    0.4 million square foot completed development project into
    AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of
    $1.9 million.

    0.2 million square foot completed development project into
    AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of
    $2.0 million.

Properties Held for Contribution.

As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company held for contribution to
    co-investment joint ventures nine industrial projects with an
    aggregate net book value of $154.0 million, which, when
    contributed to a joint venture, will reduce the Company’s
    current ownership interest from approximately 100% to an
    expected range of

15-50%.

Properties Held for Divestiture.

As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company held for divestiture four
    industrial projects with an aggregate net book value of
    $20.9 million. These properties either are not in the
    Company’s core markets or do not meet its current strategic
    objectives, or are included as part of its

development-for-sale

program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to
    negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions.
    Properties held for divestiture are stated at the lower of cost
    or estimated fair value less costs to sell.

Secured debt generally requires monthly principal and interest
    payments. Some of the loans are cross-collateralized by multiple
    properties. The secured debt is secured by deeds of trust or
    mortgages on certain properties and is generally non-recourse.
    As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the total gross
    investment book value of those properties securing the debt was
    $2.6 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, including
    $1.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, in
    consolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2006,
    $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bore interest
    at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%
    while the remaining $386.1 million bore interest at
    variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%).

As of December 31, 2006, the Operating Partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.1 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 6.2% and had an average term of 4.8 years. These
    unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in
    notes issued in June 1998, $225.0 million of medium-term
    notes, which were issued under the Operating Partnership’s
    2000 medium-term note program, $275.0 million of
    medium-term notes, which were issued under the Operating
    Partnership’s 2002 medium-term note program,
    $175.0 million of medium-term notes, which were issued
    under the Operating Partnership’s 2006 medium-term note
    program and approximately $112.5 million of
    5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers
    Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11,
    2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancelled
    $100.0 million of notes that were issued in June 1998
    resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The
    unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various
    covenants. Also included is a $25.0 million promissory note
    which matures in January 2007. Management believes that the
    Company and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with
    their financial covenants as of December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $88.2 million
    outstanding in other debt which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 6.6% and had an average term of 6.1 years. Other
    debt includes a $65.0 million non-recourse

credit facility obtained by AMB Partners II, L.P., a
    subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, which had a
    $65.0 million balance outstanding as of December 31,
    2006. The Company also had $23.2 million outstanding in
    other non-recourse debt.

On June 1, 2006, the Operating Partnership entered into a
    third amended and restated $550.0 million (includes Euros,
    Yen or U.S. Dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured
    revolving credit agreement that replaced its then-existing
    $500.0 million credit facility, which was to mature on
    June 1, 2007. The Company is a guarantor of the Operating
    Partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The
    line, which matures on June 1, 2010, carries a one-year
    extension option and can be increased to up to
    $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the
    Operating Partnership’s long-term debt rating, which was
    42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an
    annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four year credit
    facility includes a multi-currency component, under which up to
    $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. Dollars, Euros,
    Yen or British Pounds Sterling. The Operating Partnership uses
    the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding
    development activity and general working capital requirements.
    As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the
    credit facility was $303.7 million and the remaining amount
    available was $234.6 million, net of outstanding letters of
    credit of $11.7 million. The outstanding balance included
    borrowings denominated in Euros, which, using the exchange rate
    in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately
    $303.7 million in U.S. dollars. The credit agreement
    contains affirmative covenants, including compliance with
    financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified
    financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations
    on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or
    consolidations. Management believes that the Company and the
    Operating Partnership were in compliance with their financial
    covenants under this credit agreement at December 31, 2006.

On June 23, 2006, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of
    the Operating Partnership and as the initial borrower, entered
    into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a
    45.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility,
    which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31,
    2006, equaled approximately $377.9 million
    U.S. dollars. This replaced the 35.0 billion Yen
    unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 29,
    2004, as previously amended, which using the exchange rate in
    effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately
    $293.9 million U.S. dollars. The Company, along with
    the Operating Partnership, guarantees the obligations of AMB
    Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the
    obligations of any other entity in which the Operating
    Partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest
    and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under
    and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to
    use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and
    development of properties and for other real estate purposes in
    Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the
    credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of
    the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real
    estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate
    assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a
    one-year extension option. The credit facility can be increased
    to up to 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate
    in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately
    $461.9 million U.S. dollars. The extension option is
    subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the
    payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding
    commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on
    the credit rating of the Operating Partnership’s long-term
    debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31,
    2006. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in
    quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the
    Operating Partnership’s long-term debt, and was 15 basis
    points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of
    December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange
    rate in effect on December 31, 2006, was
    $320.9 million in U.S. dollars. The credit agreement
    contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting
    requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and
    negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of
    liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. Management
    believes that the Company, the Operating Partnership and AMB
    Japan Finance Y.K. were in compliance with their financial
    covenants under this credit agreement at December 31, 2006.

On June 13, 2006, the Operating Partnership and certain of
    its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and
    restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured
    revolving credit facility, which replaced the third amended and
    restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured
    credit facility. On February 16, 2006, the third amended
    and restated credit agreement replaced the then-existing
    $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was
    to mature in June 2008. The Company, along with the Operating
    Partnership, guarantees the obligations for such subsidiaries
    and other entities controlled by the Company or the Operating
    Partnership that are selected by the Operating Partnership from
    time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to the credit
    facility. The four-year credit facility includes a
    multi-currency component under which up to $250.0 million
    can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore
    dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The line, which matures in
    February 2010 and carries a one-year extension option, can be
    increased to up to $350.0 million upon certain conditions
    and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the
    outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally
    LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the Operating
    Partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt, which was
    60 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an
    annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the Operating
    Partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. The
    borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund
    the acquisition and development of properties and general
    working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility was approximately
    $227.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios by the Operating
    Partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on
    the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or
    consolidations. Management believes that the Company and the
    Operating Partnership were in compliance with their financial
    covenants under this credit agreement at December 31, 2006.

    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. These amounts are included as rental revenue and

Income
    Taxes

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code,
    commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1997.
    To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of
    organizational and operational requirements, including a
    requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its
    taxable income to its stockholders. It is management’s
    current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain
    the Company’s REIT status. As a REIT, the Company generally
    will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on net
    income it distributes currently to its stockholders. As such, no
    provision for federal income taxes has been included in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements. If the Company
    fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be
    subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates
    (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may be
    ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable
    years. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the
    Company may be subject to certain state, local taxes on its
    income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. The
    Company is required to pay federal and state income tax on its
    net taxable income, if any, from the activities conducted by the
    Company’s taxable REIT subsidiaries. Foreign income taxes
    are accrued for foreign countries in which the Company operates,
    as necessary.

Minority
    Interests in Consolidated Joint Ventures and Preferred
    Units

Minority interests in the Company represent the limited
    partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, limited
    partnership interests in AMB Property II, L.P., a Delaware
    limited partnership, and interests held by certain third parties
    in several real estate joint ventures, aggregating approximately
    36.1 million square feet, which are consolidated for
    financial reporting purposes. Such investments are consolidated
    because the Company exercises significant rights over major
    operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of
    property managers, asset management, investment activity and
    changes in financing. These joint venture investments do not
    meet the variable interest entity criteria under FASB
    Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities.

Effective October 1, 2006, the Company deconsolidated AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended
    co-investment partnership formed in 2004 with institutional
    investors, on a prospective basis, due to the

re-evaluation

of the Company’s accounting for its investment in the fund
    in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the
    general partner’s rights effective October 1, 2006.

Through the Operating Partnership, the Company enters into
    co-investment joint ventures with institutional investors. The
    Company’s co-investment joint ventures are engaged in the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006 and 2005

On December 30, 2004, the Company formed AMB-SGP Mexico,
    LLC, a joint venture with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte. Ltd., a
    subsidiary of GIC Real Estate Pte. Ltd., the real estate
    investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment
    Corporation, in which the Company retained a 20% interest.
    During 2006, the Company recognized development profits of
    $5.1 million from the contribution of two completed
    development projects for $56.4 million aggregating
    approximately 0.8 million square feet. During 2005, the
    Company recognized a gain of $1.3 million from disposition
    of real estate interests, representing the additional value
    received from the contribution of properties to AMB-SGP Mexico,
    LLC during 2004. During 2005, the Company recognized development
    profits of $1.9 million from the contribution of one
    industrial building for $23.6 million aggregating
    approximately 0.4 million square feet.

On June 30, 2005, the Company formed AMB Japan Fund I,
    L.P., a joint venture with 13 institutional investors, in which
    joint venture the Company retained an approximate 20% interest.
    The 13 institutional investors have committed 49.5 billion
    Yen (approximately $415.7 million in U.S. dollars,
    using the exchange rate at December 31, 2006) for an
    approximate 80% equity interest. During 2006, the Company
    recognized development profits of $77.9 million,
    representing the portion of the Company’s interest in the
    contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for
    cash from the contribution to the joint venture of four
    completed development projects for $486.2 million (using
    the exchange rates in effect at contribution) aggregating
    approximately 2.6 million square feet. During 2005, the
    Company contributed to the joint venture $106.9 million
    (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating
    properties, consisting of six industrial buildings, aggregating
    approximately 0.9 million square feet and recognized a gain
    of $17.6 million on the contribution, representing the
    portion of the Company’s interest in the contributed
    property acquired by the third-party investors for cash.

Effective October 1, 2006, the Company deconsolidated AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended
    co-investment partnership formed in 2004 with institutional
    investors, on a prospective basis, due to the

re-evaluation

of the Company’s accounting for its investment in the fund
    in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the
    general partner’s rights effective October 1, 2006.
    During 2006, the Company recognized development profits of
    $10.3 million, representing the portion of the
    Company’s interest in the contributed properties acquired
    by the third-party investors for cash from the contribution to
    the joint venture of three completed development projects for
    approximately $64.8 million aggregating approximately
    0.6 million square feet.

On October 17, 2006, the Company formed AMB DFS
    Fund I, LLC, a merchant development joint venture with GE
    Real Estate (“GE”), in which joint venture the Company
    retained an approximate 15% interest. The joint venture will
    have total investment capacity of approximately
    $500.0 million to pursue

development-for-sale

opportunities primarily in U.S. markets other than those
    the Company identifies as its target markets. GE and the Company
    have committed $425.0 million and $75.0 million of
    equity, respectively. During 2006, the Company contributed a
    land parcel with a contribution value of approximately
    $77.5 million to this fund and recognized development
    profits of approximately $0.8 million on the contribution,
    representing the portion of its interest in the contributed land
    parcel acquired by the third-party investor for cash.

Under the agreements governing the joint ventures, the Company
    and the other parties to the joint ventures may be required to
    make additional capital contributions and, subject to certain
    limitations, the joint ventures may incur additional debt.

The Company also has a 0.1% unconsolidated equity interest (with

    joint venture related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier
    which houses the Company’s office space in the
    San Francisco Bay Area. The investment is not consolidated

    property managers, investment activity and changes in financing.
    The Company has an option to purchase the remaining equity
    interest beginning January 1, 2007 and expiring

Stock Incentive Plans.

The Company has stock
    option and incentive plans (“Stock Incentive Plans”)
    for the purpose of attracting and retaining eligible officers,
    directors and employees. The Company has reserved for issuance
    18,950,000 shares of common stock under its Stock Incentive
    Plans. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had 6,843,025
    non-qualified options outstanding granted to certain directors,
    officers and employees. Each option is exchangeable for one
    share of the Company’s common stock. Each option’s
    exercise price is equal to

the Company’s market price on the date of grant. The
    options have an original ten-year term and generally vest pro
    rata in annual installments over a three to five-year period
    from the date of grant.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R,

Share Based
    Payment,

on January 1, 2006. The Company opted to
    utilize the modified prospective method of transition in
    adopting SFAS No. 123R. The effect of this change from
    applying the original expense recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

, had an immaterial effect on income before
    minority interests and discontinued operations, income from
    continuing operations, net income and earnings per share. The
    effect of this change from applying the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 had no effect on cash flow from operating
    and financing activities. The Company recorded a cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of
    $0.2 million as of January 1, 2006 to reflect the
    change in accounting for forfeitures. The Company values stock
    options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and
    recognizes this value as an expense over the vesting periods.
    Under this standard, recognition of expense for stock options is
    applied to all options granted after the beginning of the year
    of adoption. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, the
    Company will recognize the associated expense over the three to
    five-year vesting periods. For the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, under SFAS No. 123R or
    SFAS No. 123, related stock option expense was
    $6.8 million, $4.8 million and $4.0 million,
    respectively. Additionally, the Company awards restricted stock
    and recognizes this value as an expense over the vesting
    periods. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, related restricted stock compensation expense was
    $13.9 million, $7.5 million and $6.4 million,
    respectively. The expense is included in general and
    administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company had $5.1 million of total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to unvested options granted under the Stock
    Incentive Plans which is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 1 year. Results for prior
    periods have not been restated.

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on
    January 1, 2006, the Company’s income before income
    taxes and net income for the year ended December 31, 2006
    is $0.5 million higher than if the Company had continued to
    account for share-based compensation under the original
    provisions of SFAS No. 123. Basic and diluted earnings
    per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have
    decreased to $2.38 and $2.29, respectively, if the Company had
    not adopted SFAS No. 123R.

SFAS No. 123R requires the cash flows resulting from
    tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the
    compensation cost recognized for those options (excess tax
    benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. The Company
    does not have any such excess tax benefits.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated at the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company
    uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee
    termination within the valuation model. Expected volatilities
    are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock.
    The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the
    option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
    at the time of the grant. The following assumptions are used for
    grants during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively: dividend yields of 3.5%, 4.5% and 4.8%;
    expected volatility of 17.9%, 17.5% and 18.6%; risk-free
    interest rates of 4.6%, 3.8% and 3.6%; and expected lives of
    six, seven and seven years, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $24.1 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested
    share-based compensation arrangements granted under the stock
    incentive plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 1.96 years. The total fair value
    of shares vested, based on the market price on the vesting date,
    for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was
    $17.4 million and $9.8 million, respectively.

401(k) Plan.

In November 1997, the Company
    established a Section 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan
    (the “401(k) Plan”), which is a continuation of the
    401(k) Plan of the predecessor, to cover eligible employees of
    the Company and any designated affiliates. During 2006 and 2005,
    the 401(k) Plan permitted eligible employees of the Company to
    defer up to 20% of their annual compensation (as adjusted under
    the terms of the 401(k) Plan), subject to certain limitations
    imposed by the Code. The employees’ elective deferrals are
    immediately vested and non-forfeitable upon contribution to the
    401(k) Plan. During 2006 and 2005, the Company matched employee
    contributions under the 401(k) Plan in an amount equal to 50% of
    the first 6.0% of annual compensation deferred by each employee,
    up to a maximum match by the Company of $6,600 and
    $6,300 per year, respectively, for each participating
    employee.

Matching contributions made by the Company vest fully one year
    after the commencement of an employee’s employment with the
    Company. The Company may also make discretionary contributions
    to the 401(k) Plan. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company paid
    $0.8 million, $0.7 million and $0.5 million,
    respectively, for its 401(k) match. No discretionary
    contributions were made by the Company to the 401(k) Plan in
    2006, 2005 and 2004.

Deferred Compensation Plans.

The Company has
    established two non-qualified deferred compensation plans for
    eligible officers and directors of the Company and certain of
    its affiliates, which enable eligible participants to defer
    income from their U.S. payroll up to 100% of annual base
    pay, up to 100% of annual bonuses, up to 100% of their meeting
    fees

and/or

committee chairmanship fees, and up to 100% of certain equity-

based compensation, as applicable, subject to restrictions, on a
    pre-tax basis. This deferred compensation is our unsecured
    obligation. The Company may make discretionary matching
    contributions to participant accounts at any time. The Company
    made no such discretionary matching contributions in 2006, 2005
    or 2004. The participant’s elective deferrals and any
    matching contributions are immediately 100% vested. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the total fair value of
    compensation deferred was $70.2 million and
    $20.9 million, respectively.

Standby Letters of Credit.

As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had provided approximately
    $22.1 million in letters of credit, of which
    $11.7 million were provided under the Operating
    Partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit
    facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under
    certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other
    commitments.

Guarantees.

Other than parent guarantees
    associated with the unsecured debt, as of December 31,
    2006, the Company had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate
    amount of $48.2 million in connection with certain
    acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, the Company
    guaranteed $26.8 million and $83.2 million on
    outstanding loans on two of its consolidated joint ventures and
    two of its unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. In
    addition, as of December 31, 2006, the Company guaranteed
    $87.3 million on outstanding property debt related to one
    of its unconsolidated joint ventures.

Performance and Surety Bonds.

As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding performance
    and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $11.4 million.
    These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its
    development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax
    obligations and the construction of certain real property
    improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and
    streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by
    public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and
    surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the
    taxes due or the completion of the improvements and
    infrastructure.

Promoted Interests and Other Contractual
    Obligations.

Upon the achievement of certain
    return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, the
    Company may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint
    venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their
    contractual agreements with the Operating Partnership. From time
    to time in the normal course of the Company’s business, the
    Company enters into various contracts with third parties that
    may obligate it to make payments, pay promotes or perform other
    obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.

Contingencies

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Company may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a
    material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters.

The Company monitors
    its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic
    substances. The Company is not aware of any environmental
    liability with respect to the properties that would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business, assets
    or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance
    that such a material environmental liability does not exist. The
    existence of any such material environmental liability would
    have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations and cash flow. The Company carries environmental
    insurance and believes that the policy terms, conditions, limits
    and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the
    circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the cost of such
    coverage and current industry practice.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Company carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood and terrorism
    insurance. The Company believes that the policy terms,
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and current industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Company’s properties are located
    in areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Company has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war, that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although the Company
    has obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that it believes are
    commercially reasonable, there can be no assurance that the
    Company will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Company could lose its investment in,
    and anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property.

Various properties that the Company owns or leases in New
    Orleans, Louisiana and South Florida suffered damage in 2005 as
    a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Although the Company
    expects that its insurance will cover losses arising from this
    damage in excess of the industry standard deductibles paid by
    the Company, there can be no assurance the Company will be
    reimbursed for all losses incurred. Management is not aware of
    circumstances associated with these losses that would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business, assets
    or results from operations.

Captive Insurance Company.

In December 2001,
    the Company formed a wholly-owned captive insurance company,
    Arcata National Insurance Ltd., (Arcata), which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under the Company’s third-party policies. The
    captive insurance company is one element of the Company’s
    overall risk management program. The Company capitalized Arcata
    in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements.
    Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived
    from the past loss experience at the Company’s properties.
    Annually, the Company engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may
    be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to
    third-party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be
    reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms.
    Through this structure, the Company believes that it has more
    comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than
    would otherwise be available in the market.

Segment
    Information

The Company operates industrial properties and manages its
    business by geographic markets. Such industrial properties
    consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable
    for single or multiple customers, and are typically comprised of
    multiple buildings that are leased to customers engaged in
    various types of businesses. The Company’s geographic
    markets for industrial properties are managed separately because
    each market requires different operating, pricing and leasing
    strategies. The accounting policies of the segments are the same
    as those

Property net operating income (“NOI”) is defined as
    rental revenue, including reimbursements, less property
    operating expenses, which excludes depreciation, amortization,
    general and administrative expenses and interest expense. For a
    reconciliation of NOI to net income, see the table below.

The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental
    performance measure because NOI reflects the operating
    performance of the Company’s real estate portfolio on a
    segment basis, and the Company uses NOI to make decisions about
    resource allocations and to assess regional property level
    performance. However, NOI should not be viewed as an alternative
    measure of the Company’s financial performance since it
    does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest
    expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital
    expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and
    construction activities that could materially impact the
    Company’s results from operations. Further, the
    Company’s NOI may not be comparable to that of other real
    estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for
    calculating NOI.

Subsequent
    Event

On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P.,
    a Delaware limited partnership, which is a subsidiary of the
    Company, entered into a loan agreement for a $305 million
    secured financing. The loan is secured by more than sixty
    buildings owned by such subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P.
    $160 million of the loan will be securitized and sold on
    the open market, and the remaining portion will be held in the
    lenders’ general accounts. AMB-SGP, L.P. remains a
    guarantor of certain standard recourse carve-outs under the loan
    agreement.

On the same day, pursuant to the loan agreement the same seven
    subsidiaries delivered four promissory notes to the two lenders,
    each of which matures on March 5, 2012. One note, has a
    principal of $160 million and an interest rate that is
    fixed at 5.29%. One is a $40 million note with an interest
    rate of 81 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate, a
    second has a principal of $84 million and a fixed interest
    rate of 5.90%, and the final note has a principal of
    $21 million and bears interest at a rate of 135 basis
    points above the one-month LIBOR rate.
