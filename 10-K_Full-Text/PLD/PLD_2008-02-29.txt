FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS

Some of the information included in this annual report on

Form 10-K

contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to
    the safe-harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Because these
    forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and
    uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from those in the
    forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the
    forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The
    events or circumstances reflected in the forward-looking
    statements might not occur. You can identify forward-looking
    statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as
    “believes,” “expects,” “may,”
    “will,” “should,” “seeks,”
    “approximately,” “intends,”
    “plans,” “forecasting,” “pro
    forma,” “estimates” or “anticipates,”
    or the negative of these words and phrases, or similar words or
    phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by
    discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking
    statements should not be read as guarantees of future
    performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate
    indicators of whether, or the time at which, such performance or
    results will be achieved. There is no assurance that the events
    or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements will
    occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements are necessarily
    dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect
    or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual
    results and future events to differ materially from those set
    forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:

•

changes in general economic conditions or in the real estate
    sector;

•

defaults on or non-renewal of leases by customers or renewal
    at lower than expected rent;

•

difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in
    effecting acquisitions on advantageous terms and the failure of
    acquisitions to perform as we expect;

•

risks and uncertainties affecting property development,
    redevelopment and value-added conversion (including construction
    delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits
    and financing, public opposition to these activities, as well as
    the risks associated with our expansion of and increased
    investment in our development business);

•

risks of doing business internationally and global expansion,
    including unfamiliarity with new markets and currency risks;

•

risks of opening offices globally (including increasing
    headcount);

•

a downturn in the California, U.S., or the global economy or
    real estate conditions and other financial market
    fluctuations;

•

risks of changing personnel and roles;

•

losses in excess of our insurance coverage;

•

our failure to divest of properties on advantageous terms or
    to timely reinvest proceeds from any such divestitures;

•

unknown liabilities acquired in connection with acquired
    properties or otherwise;

•

our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and
    operations;

•

risks associated with using debt to fund acquisitions and
    development, including re-financing risks;

•

risks related to our obligations in the event of certain
    defaults under co-investment venture and other debt;

•

our failure to obtain necessary financing;

•

our failure to maintain our current credit agency ratings;

•

risks associated with equity and debt securities financings
    and issuances (including the risk of dilution);

•

changes in local, state and federal regulatory requirements,
    including changes in real estate and zoning laws;



•

increases in real property tax rates;

•

risks associated with our tax structuring;

•

increases in interest rates and operating costs or greater
    than expected capital expenditures;

•

environmental uncertainties and risks related to natural
    disasters; and

•

our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real
    estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
    as amended.

Our success also depends upon economic trends generally,
    various market conditions and fluctuations and those other risk
    factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in
    Item 1A of this report. We caution you not to place undue
    reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our
    analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or as of
    the dates indicated in the statements. All of our
    forward-looking statements, including those in this report, are
    qualified in their entirety by this statement. We assume no
    obligation to update or supplement forward-looking
    statements.



PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation, acquires,
    develops and operates industrial properties in key distribution
    markets tied to global trade in the Americas, Europe and Asia.
    We use the terms “industrial properties” or
    “industrial buildings” to describe various types of
    industrial properties in our portfolio and use these terms
    interchangeably with the following: logistics facilities,
    centers or warehouses; distribution facilities, centers or
    warehouses; High Throughput
    Distribution

®

(HTD

®

)
    facilities; or any combination of these terms. We use the term
    “owned and managed” to describe assets in which we
    have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the
    property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the
    long-term.

We commenced operations as a fully-integrated real estate
    company effective with the completion of our initial public
    offering on November 26, 1997. Our strategy focuses on
    providing industrial distribution warehouse space to customers
    who value the efficient movement of goods through the global
    supply chain, primarily in the world’s busiest distribution
    markets: large, supply-constrained infill locations with dense
    populations and proximity to airports, seaports and major
    highway systems. As of December 31, 2007, we owned, or had
    investments in, on a consolidated basis or through
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures, properties and
    development projects expected to total approximately
    147.7 million square feet (13.7 million square meters)
    in 45 markets within 14 countries. Additionally, as of
    December 31, 2007, we managed, but did not have a
    significant ownership interest in, industrial and other
    properties totaling approximately 1.5 million rentable
    square feet.

We operate our business primarily through our subsidiary, AMB
    Property, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer
    to as the “operating partnership”. As of
    December 31, 2007, we owned an approximate 96.1% general
    partnership interest in the operating partnership, excluding
    preferred units. As the sole general partner of the operating
    partnership, we have the full, exclusive and complete
    responsibility for and discretion in its

day-to-day

management and control.

Our investment strategy generally targets customers whose
    businesses are tied to global trade, which, according to the
    World Bank, has grown more than three times the world gross
    domestic product growth rate over the last 30 years. To
    serve the facility needs of these customers, we seek to invest
    in major global distribution markets and transportation hubs
    that, generally, are tied to global trade.

Our strategy is to be a leading provider of industrial
    properties in supply-constrained submarkets of our target
    markets. These infill submarkets are generally characterized by
    large population densities and typically offer substantial
    consumer concentrations, proximity to large clusters of
    distribution-facility users and significant labor pools, and are
    generally located near key international passenger and cargo
    airports, seaports and major highway systems. When measured by
    annualized base rent, on an owned and managed basis, the
    substantial majority of our portfolio of industrial properties
    is located in our target markets, and much of this is in infill
    submarkets within our target markets. Infill locations are
    characterized by supply constraints on the availability of land
    for competing projects as well as physical, political or
    economic barriers to new development.

Further, in many of our target markets, we focus on
    HTD

®

facilities, which are buildings designed to facilitate the rapid
    distribution of our customers’ products rather than the
    storage of goods. Our investment focus on
    HTD

®

assets is based on what we think to be a global trend toward
    lower inventory levels and expedited supply chains.
    HTD

®

facilities generally have a variety of physical characteristics
    that allow for the rapid transport of goods from

point-to-point.

These physical characteristics could include numerous dock
    doors, shallower building depths, fewer columns, large truck
    courts and more space for trailer parking. We think these
    building characteristics represent an important success factor
    for customers such as air express, logistics and freight
    forwarding companies that have time-sensitive needs, and that
    these facilities function best when located in convenient
    proximity to transportation infrastructure, such as major
    airports and seaports.



Of approximately 147.7 million square feet as of
    December 31, 2007:

•

on an owned and managed basis, which include investments held on
    a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated co-investment
    ventures, we owned or partially owned approximately
    118.2 million square feet (principally warehouse
    distribution buildings) that were 96.0% leased;

•

on an owned and managed basis, which include investments held on
    a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated co-investment
    ventures, we had investments in 56 industrial development
    projects, which are expected to total approximately
    17.8 million square feet upon completion;

•

on a consolidated basis, we owned 12 development projects,
    totaling approximately 4.2 million square feet, which are
    available for sale or contribution;

•

through non-managed unconsolidated co-investment ventures, we
    had investments in 46 industrial operating properties, totaling
    approximately 7.4 million square feet; and

•

we held approximately 0.1 million square feet, which is the
    location of our global headquarters.

Operating
    Strategy

We base our operating strategy on a variety of operational and
    service offerings, including in-house acquisitions, development,
    redevelopment, value-added conversion, asset management,
    property management, leasing, finance, accounting and market
    research. Our strategy is to leverage our expertise across a
    large customer base, and complement our internal management
    resources with long-standing relationships with entrepreneurial
    real estate management and development firms in certain of our
    target markets.



We believe that real estate is fundamentally a local business
    and best operated by local teams in each market. We manage our
    portfolio of properties generally through direct property
    management performed by our own employees. Additionally, within
    our flexible operating model, we may from time to time establish
    relationships with third-party real estate management firms,
    brokers and developers that provide some property-level
    administrative and management services under our direction. We
    intend to continue to increase utilization of internal
    management resources in target markets to achieve operating
    efficiencies and expose our customers to the broadening array of
    AMB service offerings, including access to multiple locations
    worldwide and

build-to-suit

developments. We actively manage our portfolio, whether directly
    or with an alliance partner, by establishing leasing strategies,
    negotiating lease terms, pricing, and level and timing of
    property improvements.

Growth
    Strategies

Growth
    through Operations

We seek to generate long-term internal growth through rent
    increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space,
    striving to maintain a high occupancy rate at our properties and
    to control expenses by capitalizing on the economies of scale
    inherent in owning, operating and growing a large, global
    portfolio. During 2007, rent on renewed and re-leased space in
    our operating portfolio increased 4.9%, on an owned and managed
    basis. This amount excludes expense reimbursements, rental
    abatements, percentage rents and straight-line rents. During
    2007, cash-basis same store net operating income, including
    lease termination fees, increased by 5.1%, on an owned and
    managed basis, and 5.5% excluding lease termination fees. We
    believe it is important to view real estate as a long-term
    investment, however, our past results are not necessarily an
    indication of our future performance. See Part II,
    Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Supplemental Earnings Measures” for a discussion of
    cash-basis same store net operating income and a reconciliation
    of cash-basis same store net operating income and net income and
    Part IV, Item 15: Note 15 of the “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for detailed segment
    information, including revenue attributable to each segment,
    gross investment in each segment and total assets.

Growth
    through Development, Redevelopment and Value-Added
    Conversions

We think that the development, redevelopment and expansion of
    well-located, high-quality industrial properties generally
    provide us with attractive investment opportunities at higher
    rates of return than may be obtained from the purchase of
    existing properties. Through the deployment of our in-house
    development and redevelopment expertise, we seek to create value
    both through new construction and the acquisition and management
    of redevelopment opportunities. Additionally, we believe that
    our historical focus on infill locations creates a unique
    opportunity to enhance stockholder value through the select
    conversion of industrial properties to higher and better uses,
    within our value-added conversion business. Value-added
    conversion projects generally involve a significant enhancement
    or a change in use of the property from industrial distribution
    warehouse to a higher and better use, such as office, retail or
    residential. New developments, redevelopments and value-added
    conversions require significant management attention, and
    development and redevelopment require significant capital
    investment, to maximize their returns. Completed development and
    redevelopment properties are generally contributed to our
    co-investment ventures and held in our owned and managed
    portfolio or sold to third parties. Value-added conversion
    properties are generally sold to third parties at some point in
    the re-entitlement/conversion process, thus recognizing the
    enhanced value of the underlying land that supports the
    property’s repurposed use. We think our global market
    presence and expertise will enable us to continue to generate
    and capitalize on a diverse range of development opportunities.

The multidisciplinary backgrounds of our employees should
    provide us with the skills and experience to capitalize on
    strategic renovation, expansion and development opportunities.
    Many of our employees have specific experience in real estate
    development, both with us and with local, national or
    international development firms. Over the past six years, we
    have significantly expanded our development staff. We pursue
    development projects directly and in co-investment ventures,
    providing us with the flexibility to pursue development projects
    independently or in partnerships, depending on market
    conditions, submarkets or building sites.

Growth
    through Acquisitions and Capital Redeployment

Our acquisition experience and our network of property
    management, leasing and acquisition resources should continue to
    provide opportunities for growth. In addition to our internal
    resources, we have long-term relationships



with leasing and investment sales brokers, as well as
    third-party local property management firms, which may give us
    access to additional acquisition opportunities because such
    managers frequently market properties on behalf of sellers. In
    addition, we seek to redeploy capital from non-strategic assets
    into properties that better fit our current investment focus.
    Since 2002, we have sold approximately $2 billion of
    operating properties, recognizing a gain of approximately
    $264 million, in an effort to exit non-target markets and
    dispose of assets that no longer fit our investment criteria.

We are generally engaged in various stages of negotiations for a
    number of acquisitions and other transactions, some of which may
    be significant, that may include, but are not limited to,
    individual properties, large multi-property portfolios or
    property owning or real estate-related entities. We cannot
    assure you that we will consummate any of these transactions.
    Such transactions, if we consummate them, may be material
    individually or in the aggregate. Sources of capital for
    acquisitions may include retained cash flow from operations,
    borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, other forms of
    secured or unsecured debt financing, issuances of debt or
    preferred or common equity securities by us or the operating
    partnership (including issuances of units in the operating
    partnership or its subsidiaries), proceeds from divestitures of
    properties, assumption of debt related to the acquired
    properties and private capital from our co-investment partners.
    See Part II, Item 7: “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Summary of Key Transactions in 2007.”

Growth
    through Global Expansion

Our long-term capital allocation goal is to have approximately
    50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in
    markets outside the United States based on annualized base rent.
    As of December 31, 2007, operating properties in our
    markets outside the United States comprised 23.8% of our owned
    and managed operating portfolio and 4.5% of our consolidated
    operating portfolio based on annualized base rent. In addition
    to the United States, we include Canada and Mexico as target
    countries in the Americas. In Europe, our target countries
    currently are Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
    Spain and the United Kingdom. In Asia, our target countries
    currently are China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We
    expect to add additional target countries outside the United
    States in the future, including Brazil and countries in
    Central/Eastern Europe.

Expansion into target markets outside the United States
    represents a natural extension of our strategy to invest in
    industrial property markets with high population densities,
    close proximity to large customer clusters and available labor
    pools, and major distribution centers serving global trade. Our
    international expansion strategy mirrors our focus in the United
    States on supply-constrained submarkets with political, economic
    or physical constraints to new development. Our international
    investments extend our offering of
    HTD

®

facilities for customers who value

speed-to-market

over storage. Specifically, we are focused on customers whose
    businesses are derived from global trade. In addition, our
    investments target major consumer distribution markets and
    customers. We think that our established customer relationships,
    our contacts in the air cargo, shipping and logistics
    industries, our underwriting of markets and investments, our
    in-house expertise and our strategic alliances with
    knowledgeable developers and managers will assist us in
    competing internationally. For a discussion of the amount of our
    revenues attributable to the United States and international
    markets, please see Part VI, Item 15: Note 15 of
    the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Growth
    through Co-Investments

We co-invest in properties with private capital investors
    through partnerships, limited liability companies or
    co-investment ventures. Our co-investment ventures are managed
    by our private capital group and typically operate under the
    same investment strategy that we apply to our other operations.
    Generally, we will own a

15-50%

interest in our co-investment ventures. We expect our
    co-investment program will continue to serve as a source of
    capital for acquisitions and developments; however, we cannot
    assure you that it will continue to do so. In addition, our
    co-investment ventures typically allow us to earn acquisition
    and development fees, asset management fees or priority
    distributions, as well as promoted interests or incentive
    distributions based on the performance of the co-investment
    ventures. As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately
    83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the
    total operating and development portfolio) through our
    consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures.



Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

BUSINESS
    RISKS

Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse
    consequences to us. These risks include, among others:

General
    Real Estate Industry Risks

Our
    performance and value are subject to general economic conditions
    and risks associated with our real estate assets.

The investment returns available from equity investments in real
    estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital
    appreciation generated by the properties, as well as the
    expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our
    properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating
    expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then
    our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be
    adversely affected. In addition, there are significant
    expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such
    as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs)
    that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the
    income from the property. Income from, and the value of, our
    properties may be adversely affected by:

•

changes in the general economic climate, including rising
    inflation;

•

local conditions, such as oversupply of or a reduction in demand
    for industrial space;

•

the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers;

•

competition from other properties;

•

our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance;

•

increased operating costs;

•

increased cost of compliance with regulations;

•

the potential for liability under applicable laws (including
    changes in tax laws); and

•

disruptions in the global supply chain caused by political,
    regulatory or other factors, including terrorism.

In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession in the
    United States and in other countries, rising interest rates or
    declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any
    of these events may occur, would result in a general decrease in
    rents, an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases
    or greater difficulty in financing our acquisition and
    development activities, which would adversely affect our
    financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist
    attacks may result in declining economic activity, which could
    reduce the demand for and the value of our properties. To the
    extent that future attacks impact our customers, their
    businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including
    their ability to continue to honor their existing leases.

Our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial
    real estate sector. As a result of this concentration, we would
    feel the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more
    acutely than if our portfolio included other property types.

We may
    be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases
    expire.

As of December 31, 2007, on an owned and managed basis,
    leases on a total of 13.2% of our industrial properties (based
    on annualized base rent) will expire on or prior to
    December 31, 2008. We derive most of our income from rent
    received from our customers. Accordingly, our financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to
    pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be
    adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew
    these expiring leases or if the rental rates upon renewal or
    reletting are significantly lower than expected. If a customer
    experiences a downturn in its business or other type of
    financial distress, then it may be unable to make timely rental
    payments or renew its lease. Further, our ability to rent space



and the rents that we can charge are impacted, not only by
    customer demand, but by the number of other properties we have
    to compete with to appeal to customers.

Actions
    by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases of the
    occupancy and rental rates of our properties.

We compete with other developers, owners and operators of real
    estate, some of which own properties similar to ours in the same
    submarkets in which our properties are located. If our
    competitors offer space at rental rates below current market
    rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our
    customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be
    pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently
    charge in order to retain customers when our customers’
    leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, cash flow,
    cash available for distribution, trading price of our common
    stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could
    be materially adversely affected.

Real
    estate investments are relatively illiquid, making it difficult
    for us to respond promptly to changing conditions.

Real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of
    assets. Further, the Internal Revenue Code regulates the number
    of properties that we, as a real estate investment trust, can
    dispose of in a year, their tax bases and the cost of
    improvements that we make to the properties. In addition, a
    portion of the properties held directly or indirectly by certain
    of our subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for
    limited partnership units in the applicable partnership. The
    contribution agreements for such properties may contain
    restrictions on certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions
    of these properties, or a portion thereof, that result in a
    taxable transaction for specified periods, following the
    contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership.
    These limitations may affect our ability to sell properties.
    This lack of liquidity and the Internal Revenue Code
    restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio
    promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions
    and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

We
    could be adversely affected if a significant number of our
    customers are unable to meet their lease
    obligations.

Our results of operations, distributable cash flow and the value
    of our stock would be adversely affected if a significant number
    of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations to
    us. In the event of a significant number of lease defaults, our
    cash flow may not be sufficient to pay dividends to our
    stockholders and repay maturing debt. As of December 31,
    2007, on an owned and managed basis, we did not have any single
    customer account for annualized base rent revenues greater than
    3.5%. However, in the event of lease defaults by a significant
    number of our customers, we may incur substantial costs in
    enforcing our rights as landlord.

We may
    be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous terms or
    acquisitions may not perform as we expect.

We acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily
    industrial properties. The acquisition of properties entails
    various risks, including the risks that our investments may not
    perform as we expect, that we may be unable to quickly and
    efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing
    operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired
    property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further,
    we face significant competition for attractive investment
    opportunities from other well-capitalized real estate investors,
    including both publicly-traded real estate investment trusts and
    private institutional investment funds. This competition
    increases as investments in real estate become increasingly
    attractive relative to other forms of investment. As a result of
    competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties
    as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly
    elevated. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions
    through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit
    facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the
    operating partnership or our subsidiaries and proceeds from
    property divestitures, which may not be available and which
    could adversely affect our cash flow. Any of the above risks
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the
    market price of, our stock.



We may
    be unable to complete renovation, development and redevelopment
    projects on advantageous terms.

As part of our business, we develop new and renovate and
    redevelop existing properties, and we intend to continue to
    expand and increase our investment in our development,
    renovation and redevelopment business. The real estate
    development, renovation and redevelopment business involves
    significant risks that could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    dividends on, and the market price of, our stock, which include
    the following risks:

•

we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects
    on favorable terms and complete construction on schedule or
    within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and
    construction costs and delays in leasing the properties and
    generating cash flow;

•

we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in
    obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy
    and other governmental permits and authorizations;

•

the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing
    cash flow below budgeted amounts;

•

we may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced value
    created by our value-added conversion projects ever or on our
    expected timetables;

•

substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment
    activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically
    require a significant amount of management’s time and
    attention, diverting their attention from our

day-to-day

operations; and

•

upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain,
    or obtain on advantageous terms, permanent financing for
    activities that we have financed through construction loans.

Risks
    Associated With Our International Business

Our
    international growth is subject to special risks and we may not
    be able to effectively manage our international
    growth.

We have acquired and developed, and expect to continue to
    acquire and develop, properties outside the United States.
    Because local markets affect our operations, our international
    investments are subject to economic fluctuations in the
    international locations in which we invest. In addition, our
    international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing
    business abroad such as revisions in tax treaties or other laws
    and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our
    international revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds,
    and, in certain parts of the world, uncertainty over property
    rights and political instability. We cannot predict the
    likelihood that any of these developments may occur. Further, we
    have entered, and may in the future enter, into agreements with

non-U.S. entities

that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute
    resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We
    cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us
    with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that
    may arise. Further, even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory
    decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could
    have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely
    basis or at all.

We also have offices in many countries outside the United States
    and, as a result, our operations may be subject to risks that
    may limit our ability to effectively establish, staff and manage
    our offices outside the United States, including:

•

differing employment practices and labor issues;

•

local business and cultural factors that differ from our usual
    standards and practices;

•

regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between
    jurisdictions; and

•

health concerns.

Our global growth (including growth in new regions in the United
    States) subjects us to certain risks, including risks associated
    with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and
    establishing effective controls and



procedures to regulate the operations of new offices. In
    addition, payroll expenses are paid in local currencies and,
    therefore, we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations
    in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and these
    currencies.

Further, our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow
    through international property acquisitions and developments. If
    we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock
    could be adversely affected.

Acquired
    properties may be located in new markets, where we may face
    risks associated with investing in an unfamiliar
    market.

We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in
    international markets that are new to us. When we acquire
    properties located in these markets, we may face risks
    associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of
    the local economy, forging new business relationships in the
    area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting
    procedures. We work to mitigate such risks through extensive
    diligence and research and associations with experienced
    partners; however, there can be no guarantee that all such risks
    will be eliminated.

We are
    subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates
    between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other
    countries in which we invest.

We are pursuing, and intend to continue to pursue, growth
    opportunities in international markets. As we invest in
    countries where the U.S. dollar is not the national
    currency, we are subject to international currency risks from
    the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the
    U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. A
    significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or
    more countries where we have a significant investment may
    materially affect our results of operations. We attempt to
    mitigate any such effects by borrowing under our multi-currency
    credit facility in the currency of the country in which we are
    investing and, under certain circumstances, by putting in place
    international currency put option contracts to hedge exchange
    rate fluctuations. For leases denominated in international
    currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to
    manage the international currency exchange risk. We cannot
    assure you, however, that our efforts will successfully
    neutralize all international currency risks. If we do engage in
    international currency exchange rate hedging activities, any
    income recognized with respect to these hedges may not qualify
    under the 75% or the 95% gross income tests that we must satisfy
    annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a real
    estate investment trust.

General
    Business Risks

Our
    performance and value are impacted by the local economic
    conditions of and the risks associated with doing business in
    California.

As of December 31, 2007, our industrial properties located
    in California represented 23.6% of the aggregate square footage
    of our industrial operating properties and 22.7% of our
    industrial annualized base rent, on an owned and managed basis.
    Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in
    California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such
    as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties)
    and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing,
    industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may
    adversely impact California’s economic climate. Because of
    the number of properties we have located in California, a
    downturn in California’s economy or real estate conditions
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the
    market price of, our stock.

We may
    experience losses that our insurance does not
    cover.

We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss
    insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in
    types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate
    given the relative risks applicable to the property, the cost of
    coverage and industry practice. Certain losses, such as those
    due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity, may be
    insured subject to certain limitations, including large
    deductibles or co-payments and policy limits. Although we have
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially
    reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage, we
    cannot



be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on comparable
    terms or collect under such policies. In addition, there are
    other types of losses, such as those from riots, bio-terrorism
    or acts of war, that are not generally insured in our industry
    because it is not economically feasible to do so. We may incur
    material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not
    be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially
    reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or
    that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one or more of
    our properties, then we could lose the capital invested in the
    damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue
    from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we
    would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial
    obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general
    partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be
    liable for all of the operating partnership’s unsatisfied
    recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the
    operating partnership as the general partner of co-investment
    ventures. Any such losses could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

A number of our properties are located in areas that are known
    to be subject to earthquake activity. U.S. properties
    located in active seismic areas include properties in the
    San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Our
    largest concentration of such properties is in California where,
    on an owned and managed basis, as of December 31, 2007, we
    had 282 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately
    27.9 million square feet and representing 23.6% of our
    industrial operating properties based on aggregate square
    footage and 22.7% based on industrial annualized base rent, on
    an owned and managed basis. International properties located in
    active seismic areas include Tokyo and Osaka, Japan and Mexico
    City, Mexico. We carry earthquake insurance on all of our
    properties located in areas historically subject to seismic
    activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that
    we believe are commercially reasonable. We evaluate our
    earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current
    industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside
    consultants.

A number of our properties are located in areas that are known
    to be subject to hurricane

and/or

flood
    risk. We carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of
    our properties located in areas historically subject to such
    activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that
    we believe are commercially reasonable. We evaluate our
    insurance coverage annually in light of current industry
    practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants.

We are
    subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties
    owned through co-investment ventures, limited liability
    companies, partnerships and other investments.

As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately
    83.4 million square feet of our properties through several
    co-investment ventures, limited liability companies or
    partnerships with third parties. Our organizational documents do
    not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in
    partnerships, limited liability companies or co-investment
    ventures and we intend to continue to develop and acquire
    properties through co-investment ventures, limited liability
    companies, partnerships with and investments in other entities
    when warranted by the circumstances. Such partners may share
    certain approval rights over major decisions and some partners
    may manage the properties in the co-investment venture
    partnership, limited liability company or co-investment venture
    investments. Partnership, limited liability company or
    co-investment venture investments involve certain risks,
    including:

•

if our partners, co-members or co-investment venturers go
    bankrupt, then we and any other remaining general partners,
    members or co-investment venturers would generally remain liable
    for the partnership’s, limited liability company’s or
    co-investment venture’s liabilities;

•

if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital
    contributions, then we may be required to contribute such
    capital;

•

our partners, co-members or co-investment venturers might have
    economic or other business interests or goals that are
    inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would
    affect our ability to operate the property;



•

our partners, co-members or co-investment venturers may have the
    power to act contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or
    objectives, including our current policy with respect to
    maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust;

•

the co-investment venture, limited liability and partnership
    agreements often restrict the transfer of a co-investment
    venture’s, member’s or partner’s interest or may
    otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we
    desire or on advantageous terms;

•

our relationships with our partners, co-members or co-investment
    venturers are generally contractual in nature and may be
    terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and
    in such event, we may not continue to own or operate the
    interests or assets underlying such relationship or may need to
    purchase such interests or assets at an above-market price to
    continue ownership;

•

disputes between us and our partners, co-members or
    co-investment venturers may result in litigation or arbitration
    that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and
    directors from focusing their time and effort on our business
    and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable
    partnership, limited liability company, or co-investment venture
    to additional risk; and

•

we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our
    partners, co-members or co-investment venturers.

We generally seek to maintain sufficient control or influence
    over our partnerships, limited liability companies and
    co-investment ventures to permit us to achieve our business
    objectives, however, we may not be able to do so, and the
    occurrence of one or more of the events described above could
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price
    of, our stock.

We may
    be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous terms or
    contribute properties.

We intend to continue to divest ourselves of properties that do
    not meet our strategic objectives, provided that we can
    negotiate acceptable terms and conditions. Our ability to
    dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors
    beyond our control, including competition from other sellers and
    the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of
    our properties. If we are unable to dispose of properties on
    favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property
    divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy, then
    our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock
    could be adversely affected.

We also anticipate contributing or selling properties to our
    co-investment ventures. If the co-investment ventures are unable
    to raise additional capital on favorable terms after currently
    available capital is depleted or if the value of such properties
    are appraised at less than the cost of such properties, then
    such contributions or sales could be delayed or prevented,
    adversely affecting our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the
    market price of, our stock. For example, although we have
    acquired land for development and made capital commitments in
    Japan and Mexico, we cannot be assured that we ultimately will
    be able to contribute such properties to our co-investment
    ventures as we have planned.

We may
    not be successful in contributing properties to our
    co-investment ventures or disposing of properties to third
    parties.

We regularly contribute properties that we acquire or develop to
    our co-investment ventures, or sell these properties to third
    parties, and we intend to continue to contribute and sell
    properties as opportunities arise and build our private capital
    business. Our ability to contribute or sell properties on
    advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners
    of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties,
    current market conditions, including the capitalization rates
    applicable to our properties, and other factors beyond our
    control. Our ability to develop and timely lease properties will
    impact our ability to contribute or sell these properties.
    Continued access to debt and equity capital, in the private and
    public markets, by our co-investment ventures is necessary in
    order for us to continue our strategy of contributing properties
    to these funds. Should we not have sufficient properties
    available that meet the investment criteria of current or future
    co-investment ventures, or should the co-investment ventures
    have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms, then
    these contributions could be delayed resulting in



adverse effects on our liquidity and on our ability to meet
    projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period.
    Failure to meet our projected earnings levels in a particular
    reporting period could have an adverse effect on our results of
    operations, distributable cash flow and on the value of our
    securities. Further, our inability to redeploy the proceeds from
    our divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy
    could have an adverse effect on our results of operations,
    distributable cash flow, our ability to meet our debt
    obligations in a timely manner and the value of our securities
    in subsequent periods.

Contingent
    or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

We have acquired and may in the future acquire properties
    subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only
    limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a
    result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon
    ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might
    have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely
    affect our cash flow. Contingent or unknown liabilities with
    respect to entities or properties acquired might include:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
    of business;

•

tax liabilities; and

•

claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and
    directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the
    properties.

We are
    dependent on external sources of capital.

In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we are
    required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least
    90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income
    (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and
    by excluding any net capital gain) and are subject to tax to the
    extent our income is not fully distributed. Consequently, we may
    not be able to fund all future capital needs, including
    acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from
    operations and may have to rely on third-party sources of
    capital. Further, in order to maintain our real estate
    investment trust status and avoid the payment of income and
    excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis
    to meet the real estate investment trust distribution
    requirements even if the then-prevailing market conditions are
    not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term borrowing
    needs could result from differences in timing between the actual
    receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax
    purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures,
    the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization
    payments. Our ability to access private debt and equity capital
    on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of
    factors, including general market conditions, the market’s
    perception of our growth potential, our current and potential
    future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of
    our capital stock.

Debt
    Financing Risks

We
    could incur more debt, increasing our debt
    service.

It is generally our policy to incur debt, either directly or
    through our subsidiaries, only if it will not cause our share of
    total

debt-to-our

share of total market capitalization ratio to exceed
    approximately 45% over the long term. Our definition of
    “our share of total market capitalization” is our
    share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation
    preferences plus market equity. See footnote 1 to the
    Capitalization Ratios table contained in Part II,
    Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operation —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources” for our definitions of
    “market equity” and “our share of total
    debt.” The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may
    incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in
    the market price per share of our capital stock. Further, our
    management could alter or eliminate this policy without
    stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we could
    become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt
    service that could adversely affect the cash available for
    distribution to our stockholders.



We
    face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions
    and developments, including refinancing and interest rate
    risk.

As of December 31, 2007, we had total debt outstanding of
    $3.5 billion. We guarantee the operating partnership’s
    obligations with respect to the senior debt securities
    referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks
    normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that
    our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of
    principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a
    small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity.
    Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion
    of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we
    may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of
    any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our
    existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal
    payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other
    capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not
    be sufficient in all years to repay all such maturing debt and
    to pay dividends to our stockholders. Furthermore, if prevailing
    interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such
    as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate
    loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then
    the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness
    would increase. Higher interest rates on newly incurred debt may
    negatively impact us as well. If interest rates increase, our
    interest costs and overall costs of capital will increase, which
    could adversely affect our transaction and development activity,
    financial condition, results of operation, cash flow, the market
    price of our stock, our ability to pay principal and interest on
    our debt and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.

In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to
    secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet
    mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or
    transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income
    and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the
    market price of, our stock.

As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding guarantees in
    the amount of $95.9 million in connection with certain
    acquisitions. As of December 31, 2007, we also guaranteed
    $41.2 million and $107.9 million on outstanding loans
    on five of our consolidated co-investment ventures and two of
    our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, respectively. Also,
    we have entered into contribution agreements with certain of our
    unconsolidated co-investment venture funds. These contribution
    agreements require us to make additional capital contributions
    to the applicable co-investment venture fund upon certain
    defaults by the co-investment venture of its debt obligations to
    the lenders. Such additional capital contributions will cover
    all or part of the applicable co-investment venture’s debt
    obligation and may be greater than our share of the
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation or the value of our
    share of any property securing such debt. Our contribution
    obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the
    amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the
    property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the
    lender upon default. Our potential obligations under these
    contribution agreements were $160.2 million as of
    December 31, 2007. We intend to continue to guarantee debt
    of our unconsolidated co-investment venture funds and make
    additional contributions to our unconsolidated co-investment
    venture funds in connection with property contributions to the
    funds. Such payment obligations under such guarantees and
    contribution obligations under such contribution agreements, if
    required to be paid, could be of a magnitude that could
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price
    of, our stock.

Adverse
    changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our
    financing activity.

The credit ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt and
    preferred stock are based on our operating performance,
    liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and
    other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their
    rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount
    of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings
    we may obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our
    current credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur
    higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining
    additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings
    may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences
    under our current and future credit facilities and debt
    instruments. Since we depend on debt financing to fund our
    acquisition and development activity, adverse changes in our
    credit ratings could negatively impact our development and
    acquisition activity, future growth, financial condition, and
    the market price of our stock.



Covenants
    in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness
    require that we comply with a number of financial and other
    covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and
    leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These
    covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our
    failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default
    under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied
    our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2007, we had
    certain non-recourse, secured loans, which are
    cross-collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on
    any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such
    indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to
    avoid foreclosure on all the cross-collateralized properties
    within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or
    our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could
    adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price
    of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior
    debt securities contain certain cross-default provisions, which
    are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness
    is in default. These cross-default provisions may require us to
    repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt
    securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in
    default, which could adversely affect our financial condition,
    results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends
    on, and the market price of, our stock.

Failure
    to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect
    results of operations.

We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by
    using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate
    cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These
    agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the
    counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these
    arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in
    reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court
    could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable.
    Hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. Failure
    to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may
    materially adversely affect our results of operations.

Conflicts
    of Interest Risks

Some
    of our directors and executive officers are involved in other
    real estate activities and investments and, therefore, may have
    conflicts of interest with us.

From time to time, certain of our executive officers and
    directors may own interests in other real-estate related
    businesses and investments, including de minimis holdings of the
    equity securities of public and private real estate companies.
    Our executive officers’ involvement in other real
    estate-related activities could divert their attention from our

day-to-day

operations. Our executive officers have entered into
    non-competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have
    agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly,
    in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any
    investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate,
    other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the
    outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such
    activities or through certain specified investments. State law
    may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. We will not
    acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or
    their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a
    majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the
    rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of
    directors with respect to that transaction.

Our
    role as general partner of the operating partnership may
    conflict with the interests of our stockholders.

As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have
    fiduciary obligations to the operating partnership’s
    limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the
    interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons
    holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as
    a class on certain amendments to the operating
    partnership’s partnership agreement and individually to
    approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their
    rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in
    a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders.
    In addition, under the terms of the operating partnership’s
    partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will
    have certain approval rights with respect to certain
    transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not
    exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all
    stockholders.



Risks
    Associated with Government Regulations

The
    costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and
    any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for
    these items.

Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a
    current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be
    liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of
    certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at,
    on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or
    remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws
    typically impose liability and

clean-up

responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator
    knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more
    than one person may have been responsible for the contamination,
    each person covered by the environmental laws may be held
    responsible for all of the

clean-up

costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or
    operator of a site for damages based on personal injury,
    property damage or other costs, including investigation and

clean-up

costs, resulting from the environmental contamination.

Environmental laws in some countries, including the United
    States, also require that owners or operators of buildings
    containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos,
    adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with
    asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or
    other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during
    building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines
    and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply
    with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek
    recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated
    with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain
    asbestos-containing building materials.

In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been
    leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use,
    store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous
    or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of
    such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our
    properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that
    have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other
    hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have
    engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may
    release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time,
    we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with
    known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the
    environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are
    quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior
    risk-adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the
    costs of environmental investigation,

clean-up

and
    monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate
    environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection
    with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain
    responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or
    monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.

At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to
    a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent
    environmental consultants and we may have additional
    Phase II testing performed upon the consultant’s
    recommendation. These environmental assessments have not
    revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability
    that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
    Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal
    all environmental liabilities and that there are material
    environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known
    environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are
    greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties’
    current environmental condition may be affected by customers,
    the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the
    properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks) or
    by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with
    existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our
    budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and
    the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected.

Compliance
    or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act
    and other similar regulations could result in substantial
    costs.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public
    accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to
    access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result
    in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the
    award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to
    make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans
    with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then
    our cash



flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders
    may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to
    various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such
    as state and local fire and life-safety requirements. We could
    incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with
    these requirements. While we believe that our properties are
    currently in material compliance with these regulatory
    requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements
    may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated
    expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of
    operations.

Federal
    Income Tax Risks

Our
    failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have
    serious adverse consequences to our stockholders.

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under
    Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”)
    commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997.
    We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate
    investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe
    that our current organization and method of operation comply
    with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal
    Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real
    estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have
    been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow
    us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our
    future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.
    Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to
    satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a
    quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex
    sections of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only
    limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and
    involves the determination of various factual matters and
    circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in
    order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must
    derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from
    qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to our
    stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real
    estate investment trust taxable income (determined without
    regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital
    gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly
    basis. These provisions and the applicable Treasury regulations
    are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets
    through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations,
    administrative interpretations or court decisions could
    significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification
    as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax
    consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of
    any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our
    ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust.

If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any
    taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax
    (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our
    taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are
    entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would
    be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust
    for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost
    our qualification. If we lost our real estate investment trust
    status, our net earnings available for investment or
    distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for
    each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be
    required to make distributions to our stockholders.

Certain
    property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income,
    resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the
    transaction.

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some
    of our properties, including by contributing properties to our
    co-investment venture funds. Under the Internal Revenue Code,
    any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as
    inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary
    course of business is treated as income from a prohibited
    transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. We do not believe
    that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions
    of properties into our co-investment venture funds are properly
    treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is
    held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends
    on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular
    transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that
    certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or
    contributions of properties into our co-investment venture funds
    are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal
    Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the
    Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a
    transfer, disposition, or contribution of property constituted a
    prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100%
    penalty tax on any gain allocable



to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from
    a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to
    satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate
    investment trust.

Risks
    Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel

We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key
    employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may
    change. While we believe that we could find suitable employees
    to meet our personnel needs, the loss of key personnel, any
    change in their roles, or the limitation of their availability
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the
    market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements
    with any of our executive officers.

Because our compensation packages include equity-based
    incentives, pressure on our stock price or limitations on our
    ability to award such incentives could affect our ability to
    offer competitive compensation packages to our executives and
    key employees. If we are unable to continue to attract and
    retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required
    to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our
    performance and competitive position could be materially
    adversely affected.

Risks
    Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
    business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in
    our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over
    financial reporting.

The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
    procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not
    prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While
    management will continue to review the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
    financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal
    control over financial reporting will be effective in
    accomplishing all control objectives all of the time.
    Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal
    control over financial reporting which may occur in the future
    could result in misstatements of our results of operations,
    restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock
    price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business,
    reputation, results of operations, financial condition or
    liquidity.

Risks
    Associated with Ownership of Our Stock

Limitations
    in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in
    control.

Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer or
    prevent a change in control or other transaction that could
    provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to
    realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the
    common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate
    investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than
    50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or
    constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the
    Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the
    last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for
    which a real estate investment trust election is made.
    Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of
    100 persons for at least 335 days of a

12-month

taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In
    addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock,
    actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our
    customers (or a customer of any partnership in which we are a
    partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or
    through any such partnership) from that customer will not be
    qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment
    trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help
    us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust
    for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership,
    actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions
    of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than
    9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more
    restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our
    common stock, series L preferred stock, series M
    preferred stock, series O preferred stock, and
    series P preferred stock (unless such limitations are
    waived by our board of directors). We also prohibit the
    ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our
    series D preferred stock by any single person so that no
    such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by
    such person, including any common stock or other series of
    preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and
    outstanding capital stock (unless such limitations are waived by
    our board of directors). We refer to this limitation as



the “ownership limit.” The charter provides that
    shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will
    be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated
    charitable beneficiary. The charter further provides that any
    person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit
    will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be
    entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the
    subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the
    price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale.
    A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be
    void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have
    the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in
    control and, therefore, could adversely affect our
    stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the
    then-prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock
    in connection with such transaction.

Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common
    and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and
    other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we
    issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so
    at the present time, it could establish a series or class of
    preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying,
    deferring or preventing a transaction, including a change in
    control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock
    or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other
    provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders
    without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may
    delay, defer or prevent a transaction, including a change in
    control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include:

•

directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a
    two-thirds vote of stockholders;

•

our board can fix the number of directors within set limits
    (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill
    vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the
    remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the
    case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the
    board, a majority of the entire board;

•

stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or
    propose business for consideration at a stockholders’
    meeting; and

•

the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is
    necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting.

Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include:

•

a two-thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our
    charter; and

•

stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous
    approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in
    question.

In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder
    approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may
    impede a change in control.

The
    price per share of our stock may fluctuate
    significantly.

The market price per share of our common stock may fluctuate
    significantly in response to many factors, including:

•

actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating
    results or dividends;

•

changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•

publication of research reports about us or the real estate
    industry;

•

the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the
    attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other
    equity securities (including securities issued by other real
    estate-based companies);

•

general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in
    interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead
    prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual
    yield from future dividends;

•

a change in analyst ratings or our credit ratings;

•

changes in market valuations of similar companies;



•

adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the
    future;

•

additions or departures of key management personnel;

•

actions by institutional stockholders;

•

speculation in the press or investment community;

•

terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our
    securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and
    causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence
    and spending;

•

governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws;

•

the realization of any of the other risk factors included or
    incorporated by reference in this report; and

•

general market and economic conditions.

Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These
    factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock
    to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of
    operations, business or our prospects.

If we
    issue additional securities, then the investment of existing
    stockholders will be diluted.

As a real estate investment trust, we are dependent on external
    sources of capital and may issue common or preferred stock or
    debt securities to fund our future capital needs. We have
    authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or
    debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership or AMB
    Property II, L.P., to issue limited partnership units, in
    exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have
    no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued
    by the operating partnership, AMB Property II, L.P., or us and
    any issuance of additional equity securities may adversely
    effect the market price of our stock and could result in
    dilution of an existing stockholder’s investment.

Earnings,
    cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the
    price of our stock.

As a real estate investment trust, the market value of our
    equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the
    market’s perception of our growth potential and our current
    and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity
    securities’ market value is based secondarily upon the
    market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this
    reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher
    or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that
    we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working
    capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while
    increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not
    correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our
    failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to
    future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect
    the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield
    on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock)
    relative to market interest rates may also influence the price
    of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead
    prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher
    distribution yield, which would adversely affect our
    stock’s market price. Additionally, if the market price of
    our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain
    covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could
    adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future
    acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our
    stockholders.

We
    could change our investment and financing policies without a
    vote of stockholders.

Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our
    qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change
    is approved by our board of directors under certain
    circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment
    and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt,
    capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Our board
    of directors may revise or amend these strategies and policies
    at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may
    not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely
    affect our financial condition or results of operations,
    including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.

Shares
    available for future sale could adversely affect the market
    price of our common stock.

The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had
    3,992,607 common limited partnership units issued and
    outstanding as of December 31, 2007, which may be exchanged
    generally one year after their issuance on a



one-for-one

basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the
    operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue
    additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of
    common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties
    or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the
    shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited
    partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets
    over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted,
    or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to
    Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock
    option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market
    pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or
    pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2007, under
    our stock option and incentive plans, we had
    9,443,727 shares of common stock reserved and available for
    future issuance, had outstanding options to purchase
    5,855,777 shares of common stock (of which 4,660,584 are
    vested and exercisable) and had 652,838 unvested restricted
    shares of common stock outstanding. Future sales of a
    substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market
    or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely
    affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the
    existence of the operating partnership’s limited
    partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved
    for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the
    exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above,
    may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain
    additional capital through the sale of equity securities.

INDUSTRIAL
    PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2007, we owned and managed 1,060
    industrial buildings aggregating approximately
    118.2 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated
    basis, we had 788 industrial buildings aggregating approximately
    78.0 million rentable square feet), excluding development
    and renovation projects and recently completed development
    projects available for sale or contribution, located in 45
    markets throughout the United States and in Canada, China,
    Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands,
    Singapore and the United Kingdom. Our industrial properties were
    96.0% leased to 2,591 customers, the largest of which accounted
    for no more than 3.5% of our annualized base rent from our
    industrial properties. See Part IV, Item 15:
    Note 15 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for segment information related to our
    operations.

Property Characteristics.

Our industrial
    properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution
    facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are
    typically comprised of multiple buildings.

The following table identifies types and characteristics of our
    industrial buildings and each type’s percentage, based on
    square footage, of our total owned and managed operating
    portfolio, which we define as properties in which we have at
    least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or
    asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long-term.

Lease Terms.

Our industrial properties are
    typically subject to leases on a “triple net basis,”
    in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate
    taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases
    on a “modified gross basis,” in which customers pay
    expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of our
    leases include fixed rental increases or Consumer Price
    Index-based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from
    three to ten years, with a weighted average of six years,
    excluding renewal options. However, the majority of our
    industrial leases do not include renewal options.

Overview of Principal Global Markets.

Our
    industrial properties are typically located near key
    international passenger and cargo airports, seaports and major
    highway systems in major metropolitan areas, which include
    Chicago, Northern New Jersey/New York City, Paris, the
    San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, South Florida, Southern
    California, Tokyo and U.S. On-Tarmac. Our other markets in
    the Americas are Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Dallas,
    Guadalajara, Houston, Mexico City, Minneapolis, Monterrey, New
    Orleans, Orlando, Querétaro, Savannah, Tijuana and Toronto.
    In Europe, our other markets are Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt,
    Hamburg, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Rotterdam. In Asia, our
    markets are Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai and Singapore.

Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are
    generally concentrated in locations with limited new
    construction opportunities within established, relatively large
    submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of
    occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere.
    These infill locations are typically near major airports,
    seaports or convenient to major highway systems and rail lines,
    and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is
    typically broad demand for industrial space in these
    centrally-located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries
    and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution,
    light assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations
    at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer
    constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties.



Portfolio
    Overview

The following includes our owned and managed operating portfolio
    and development properties, investments in operating properties
    through non-managed unconsolidated co-investment ventures, and
    recently completed developments that have not yet been placed in
    operations but are being held for sale or contribution:

    basis) per the terms of the lease, as of December 31, 2007,
    multiplied by 12. If free rent is granted, then the first
    positive rent value is used. Leases denominated in foreign
    currencies are translated using the currency exchange rate at
    December 31, 2007.

Consolidated
    Co-investment Ventures:

As of December 31, 2007, we held interests in co-investment
    ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with
    institutional investors and other third parties, which we
    consolidate in our financial statements. Such investments are
    consolidated because we own a majority interest or, as general
    partner, exercise significant control over major operating
    decisions such as acquisition or disposition decisions, approval
    of budgets, selection of property managers and changes in
    financing. Under the agreements governing the co-investment
    ventures, we and the other party to the co-investment venture
    may be required to make additional capital contributions and,
    subject to certain limitations, the co-investment ventures may
    incur additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain
    restrictions on the transfer of co-investment venture interests
    by us or the other party to the co-investment venture and
    typically provide certain rights to us or the other party to the
    co-investment venture to sell our or their interest in the
    co-investment venture to the co-investment venture or to the
    other co-investment venture partner on terms specified in the
    agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, many of the
    co-investment ventures include buy/sell provisions. See
    Part IV, Item 15: Note 8 of the “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional details.

Unconsolidated Co-investment Ventures:

As of December 31, 2007, we held interests in five
    significant equity investment co-investment ventures that are
    not consolidated in our financial statements. Effective
    October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P. on a prospective basis. The
    management and control over significant aspects of these
    investments are held by the third-party co-investment venture
    partners and we are not the primary beneficiary for the
    investments that meet the variable-interest entity consolidation
    criteria under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.

Secured
    Debt

As of December 31, 2007, we had $1.5 billion of
    secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by
    deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2007, the
    total gross investment book value of those properties securing
    the debt was $2.1 billion. Of the $1.5 billion of
    secured indebtedness, $1.1 billion was consolidated
    co-investment venture debt secured by properties with a gross
    investment value of $1.8 billion. For additional details,
    see Part II, Item 7: “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and
    Part IV, Item 15: Note 5 of “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this report.
    We believe that as of December 31, 2007, the fair value of
    the properties securing the respective obligations in each case
    exceeded the principal amount of the outstanding obligations.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

As of December 31, 2007, there were no material pending
    legal proceedings to which we were a party or of which any of
    our properties was the subject, the adverse determination of
    which we anticipate would have a material adverse effect upon
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on
    November 21, 1997 under the symbol “AMB.” As of
    February 20, 2007, there were approximately 479 holders of
    record of our common stock (excluding shares held through The
    Depository Trust Company, as nominee). Set forth below are
    the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock, as
    reported on the NYSE composite tape, and the distribution per

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

GENERAL

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations in
    conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial
    statements.

We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate
    investment trust and expect that we have qualified, and will
    continue to qualify, as a real estate investment trust for
    federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended
    December 31, 1997. As a self-administered and self-managed
    real estate investment trust, our own employees perform our
    corporate administrative and management functions, rather than
    our relying on an outside manager for these services. We manage
    our portfolio of properties generally through direct property
    management performed by our own employees. Additionally, within
    our flexible operating model, we may from time to time establish
    relationships with third-party real estate management firms,
    brokers and developers that provide some property-level
    administrative and management services under our direction.

Management’s
    Overview

The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received
    from customers under long-term (generally three to ten years)
    operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements
    from customers for certain operating costs. We also generate
    earnings from our private capital business, which consists of
    acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and
    priority distributions, and promoted interests and incentive
    distributions from our co-investment ventures. Additionally, we
    generate earnings from the disposition of projects in our

development-for-sale

and value-



added conversion programs, from the contributions of development
    properties to our co-investment ventures and from land sales.
    Our long-term growth is driven by our ability to:

•

maintain and increase occupancy rates

and/or

increase rental rates at our properties;

•

continue to develop properties profitably and sell to third
    parties or contribute to our co-investment ventures; and

•

continue to grow our earnings from our private capital business
    through the contribution of properties or from the acquisition
    of new properties.

Real
    Estate Operations

Real estate fundamentals in the United States industrial markets
    held steady during 2007 due to balanced supply and demand.
    According to data provided by Torto-Wheaton Research,
    availability was 9.4% for the quarter ended December 31,
    2007, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter and
    unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2006. Activity levels were
    lower than the prior year. According to Torto-Wheaton Research,
    absorption was 21.4 million square feet for the fourth
    quarter and 120.2 million square feet for the full year,
    down from 209.3 million square feet in 2006, whereas
    construction completions were 40.3 million square feet in
    the quarter and 126.8 million square feet for the full
    year, down from 175.1 million square feet in 2006. While
    absorption in 2007 was 17.5% below the

19-year

quarter average, construction completions were 22.6% below the
    average for the same period, which we believe indicates a market
    in equilibrium with a moderating supply of new industrial space
    entering the market. Reflecting the slowdown in the
    U.S. economy, we believe that net absorption for the first
    quarter of 2008 will be at or slightly below the fourth quarter
    2007 level and similar in the second quarter of 2008. We
    presently expect

pick-up

in
    the second half of 2008 to a full year absorption level
    approximating that of 2007. With a similar moderation in
    deliveries, we believe that year-end vacancy will also
    approximate that of 2007.

We think the strongest industrial markets in the United States
    are the major coastal markets tied to global trade, including
    Southern California — which is our largest
    market — Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area,
    Northern New Jersey/New York and Miami. While we expect demand
    to moderate in the first half of 2008, due primarily to the
    slower growth rate in import volumes and the uncertainty in the
    economy, we believe our coastal markets will outperform other
    U.S. industrial markets. These markets have some of the
    highest occupancy rates in the country and we, therefore, expect
    to see some further rate growth in 2008, even as the national
    economic picture plays out.

The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics
    for our owned and managed operating properties for the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006:

Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which
    we define as properties in which we have at least a 10%
    ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset
    manager, and which we intend to hold for the long-term. This
    excludes development and renovation projects and recently
    completed development projects available for sale or
    contribution.



(2)

Rent changes on renewals and rollovers are calculated as the
    difference, weighted by square feet, of the net ABR due the
    first month of a term commencement and the net ABR due the
    last month of the former tenant’s term. If free rent is
    granted, then the first positive full rent value is used as a
    point of comparison. The rental amounts exclude base stop
    amounts, holdover rent and premium rent charges. If either the
    previous or current lease terms are under 12 months, then
    they are excluded from this calculation. If the lease is first
    generation or there is no prior lease for comparison, then it is
    excluded from this calculation.

(3)

On a consolidated basis for the Americas, Europe and Asia,
    occupancy percentage at period end for 2007 was 96.6%, 100.0%
    and 100.0%, and rent change on renewals and rollovers at period
    end for 2007 was 4.2%, 0.0% and 48.7%, respectively. On a
    consolidated basis, for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy
    percentage at period end for 2006 was 97.0%, 98.1% and 100.0%,
    and rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2006
    was 4.2%, 0.0% and 0.0%, respectively.

We believe that higher occupancy levels in our portfolio, driven
    in part by strengthening fundamentals in our markets tied to
    global trade, are contributing to rental rate growth in our
    portfolio. Our operating portfolio’s average occupancy rate
    in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 95.6%, on an owned and managed
    basis, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior
    quarter and 30 basis points from December 31, 2006.
    Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio
    increased 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007, which we think
    reflect the generally positive trends in real estate
    fundamentals in our markets. During the quarter, cash-basis same
    store net operating income, with and without the effect of lease
    termination fees, grew by 3.3% and 4.8%, respectively, on an
    owned and managed basis. See “Supplemental Earnings
    Measures” below for a discussion of cash-basis same store
    net operating income and a reconciliation of cash-basis same
    store net operating income and net income. We believe that
    market rents have generally recovered from their lows and, in
    many of our markets, are back to or above their prior peak
    levels of 2001.

Private
    Capital Business

In June 2007, we announced the formation of AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, our eleventh co-investment fund since our
    initial public offering in 1997. This Euro-denominated, open-end
    commingled fund is our tenth active fund. The fund’s
    investment strategy focuses on acquiring stabilized industrial
    distribution properties, including those developed by us, near
    high-volume airports, seaports and transportation networks, and
    in the major metropolitan areas of Europe, with initial target
    markets in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
    Spain, the United Kingdom and Central/Eastern Europe. The gross
    asset value of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS was approximately
    $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007.

Going forward, we believe that our co-investment program with
    private-capital investors will continue to serve as a
    significant source of revenues and capital for new investments.
    Through these co-investment ventures, we typically earn
    acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority
    distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive
    distributions based on the performance of the co-investment
    ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to
    do so. Through contribution of development properties to our
    co-investment ventures, we expect to recognize value creation
    from our development pipeline. In anticipation of the formation
    of future co-investment ventures, we may also hold acquired and
    newly developed properties for later contribution to future
    funds.

As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately
    83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the
    total operating and development portfolio) through our
    consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We may
    make additional investments through these co-investment ventures
    or new co-investment ventures in the future and presently plan
    to do so.

Development
    Business

Our development business consists of

ground-up

development, redevelopment, renovations, land sales, and
    value-added conversions. We generate earnings from our
    development business through the disposition or contribution of
    projects from these activities. We expect our development
    business to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we
    expand the pipeline across each category.

We believe that customer demand for new industrial space in
    strategic markets tied to global trade will continue to outpace
    supply. To capitalize on this demand, we intend to continue to
    expand our development business



in our existing markets and into new markets around the world
    that are essential to global trade. We also will continue to
    redevelop existing industrial buildings opportunistically by
    investing significant amounts of capital to enhance the
    functionality of the properties to meet current industrial
    market demands. In addition to our committed development
    pipeline, we hold a total of 2,535 acres of land for future
    development or sale, 91% of which is located in the Americas. We
    currently estimate that these 2,535 acres of land could
    support approximately 44.0 million square feet of future
    development.

We believe that our historical investment focus on industrial
    real estate in some of the world’s most strategic infill
    markets positions us to create value through the select
    conversion of industrial properties to higher and better uses
    (value-added conversions). Generally, we expect to sell to third
    parties our value-added conversion projects at some point in the
    re-entitlement/conversion process, thus recognizing the enhanced
    value of the underlying land that supports the property’s
    repurposed use. Value-added conversions involve the repurposing
    of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including
    office, residential, retail, research & development or
    manufacturing. Activities required to prepare the property for
    conversion to a higher and better use may include such
    activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and
    retenanting. The sales price of the value-added conversion
    project is generally based on the underlying land value based on
    its ultimate use and as such, little to no residual value is
    ascribed to the industrial building.

Our long-term capital allocation goal is to have approximately
    50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in

non-U.S. markets

based on owned and managed annualized base rent. As of
    December 31, 2007, our

non-U.S. operating

properties comprised 23.8% of our owned and managed operating
    portfolio and 4.5% of our consolidated operating portfolio based
    on annualized base rent. In addition to the United States, we
    include Canada and Mexico as target countries in the Americas.
    In Europe, our target countries currently are Belgium, France,
    Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.
    In Asia, our target countries currently are China, India, Japan,
    Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target
    countries outside the United States in the future, including
    countries in Central/Eastern Europe.

To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust,
    we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually
    at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely
    on retained earnings to fund our on-going operations to the same
    extent that other corporations that are not real estate
    investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both
    the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs,
    acquisitions and developments. See “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” for a complete discussion of the sources of our
    capital.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 5, 8 and 10 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
    of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements,
    which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The
    preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our
    assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our
    estimates on historical experience and on various other
    assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
    judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
    that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions. We believe the following critical accounting
    policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates
    used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless
    circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which
    case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated
    fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or
    below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs
    for acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability
    accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes
    are reviewed for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period
    in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property
    is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property
    over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. For
    properties held for sale, impairment is recognized when the
    carrying value of the property is less than its estimated fair
    value net of cost to sell. As a result of leasing activity and
    the economic environment, we re-evaluated the carrying value of
    our investments and recorded impairment charges of
    $1.2 million, $6.3 million and $0.0, during the years
    ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, on
    certain of our investments.

Revenue Recognition.

We record rental revenue
    from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of
    the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that
    may result from the inability of our customers to make required
    payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments
    that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts,
    security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to
    recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods.
    We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers
    on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial condition
    periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our
    outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents,
    for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also
    record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a
    definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the
    termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be
    met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains
    in the leased space following the execution of a definitive
    termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are
    deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s
    occupancy.

Property Dispositions.

We report real estate
    dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated
    statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our
    interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the
    sale represent the interests acquired by third-party investors
    for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real
    estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we
    dispose of value-added conversion projects and build-to-suit and
    speculative development projects for which we have not generated
    material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss
    recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported
    net of estimated



taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits,
    net of taxes, within continuing operations of the statement of
    operations. Third, we dispose of value-added conversion and
    other redevelopment projects for which we may have generated
    material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss
    recognized is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable,
    in the development gains line within discontinued operations.
    Lastly, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets,

requires us to separately report as
    discontinued operations the historical operating results
    attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable
    gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is
    included in development gains and gains from dispositions of
    real estate, net of taxes and minority interests, in the
    statement of operations. The consolidated statements of
    operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with
    this classification. There is no impact on our previously
    reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash
    flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the
    full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to
    transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full
    accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when
    the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met.

Co-investment Ventures.

We hold interests in
    both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We
    determine consolidation based on standards set forth in Emerging
    Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue

No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights,

or
    FASB Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities

(FIN 46). For co-investment ventures
    that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46
    where we are not the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate
    the co-investment venture for financial reporting purposes.

Based on the guidance set forth in

EITF 04-5,

we consolidate certain co-investment venture investments because
    we exercise significant control over major operating decisions,
    such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers,
    asset management, investment activity and changes in financing.
    For co-investment ventures under

EITF 04-5,

where we do not exercise significant control over major
    operating and management decisions, but where we exercise
    significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting
    and do not consolidate the

co-investment

venture for financial reporting purposes.

Capitalized General and Administrative
    Expenses.

We capitalize general and
    administrative expenses, related to development projects based
    on time spent on development activities.

Real Estate Investment Trust.

As a real estate
    investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate
    level federal income taxes in the United States if we meet
    minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests.
    However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and
    state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject
    to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is
    required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our
    taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and
    international entities. A deferred tax component could arise
    based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items
    such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe
    deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated
    balance sheet.

CONSOLIDATED
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective
    basis, due to the re-evaluation of the accounting for our
    investment in the fund because of changes to the partnership
    agreement regarding the general partner’s rights effective
    October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations
    presented below are not comparable between years presented.

The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store
    growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures.
    Same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the
    end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and
    excludes development properties stabilized after
    December 31, 2005 (generally defined as properties that are
    90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete
    for at least 12 months).

As of December 31, 2007, same store industrial pool
    consisted of properties aggregating approximately
    72.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during
    2007 consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately
    0.7 million square feet. The properties acquired during
    2006 consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately
    6.6 million square feet. During 2007, property divestitures
    and contributions consisted of 32



properties, aggregating approximately 8.6 million square
    feet. In 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted
    of 50 properties, aggregating approximately 7.5 million
    square feet. Our future financial condition and results of
    operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the
    acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our
    future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical
    results.

U.S. industrial same store rental revenues decreased
    $26.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P., on October 1, 2006 partially offset by rent increases
    on renewals and rollovers. Same store rental revenues for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 would have been
    $513.4 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The
    2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating
    approximately 6.6 million square feet. The 2007 acquisitions
    consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately
    0.7 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues
    from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at
    several of our development projects where development activities
    have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the
    number of development projects. Other industrial revenues
    include rental revenues from properties that have been
    contributed to an unconsolidated co-investment venture, and
    accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our
    consolidated financial statements, and development projects that
    have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of
    the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in
    other industrial revenues was primarily due to an increase in
    base rents. The decrease in revenues from

non-U.S. industrial

properties was primarily due to the contribution of
    4.2 million square feet of operating properties and
    approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed
    development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS. The
    decrease in private capital income of



$14.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive
    fees, acquisition fees, and disposition fees offset by an
    increase in asset management fees as a result of an increase in
    total assets under management.

Same store properties’ operating expenses decreased
    $2.1 million from the prior year due primarily to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P., on October 1, 2006. Same store operating expenses for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been
    $140.3 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The
    increase of approximately $12.5 million, had AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. been deconsolidated
    as of January 1, 2006, was primarily due to increased
    insurance costs, real estate taxes, roads and grounds expense,
    and management fees. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31
    properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square
    feet. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties,
    aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The
    increase in development operating costs was primarily due to
    increased operations in certain development projects which have
    been substantially completed. This increase was primarily due to
    increases in real estate taxes and utilities. The increase in
    other industrial property operating costs was primarily due to
    insurance, cleaning and non-reimbursable expenses. The decrease
    in property operating costs from

non-U.S. industrial

properties is primarily due to the contribution of
    4.2 million square feet of operating properties and
    approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed
    development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS. The
    decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. The increase in general and administrative expenses was
    primarily due to additional staffing and the opening of new
    offices both domestically and internationally. The decrease of
    fund costs from the prior year is due primarily to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. The impairment losses during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 were taken on non-core assets as a result
    of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment.
    The impairment losses during the year ended December 31,
    2006 were taken on several non-core assets as a result of
    leasing activities and changes in the economic environment



and the holding period of certain assets. Other expenses
    increased approximately $2.5 million from the prior year
    due primarily to an increase in dead deal expenditures.

Development gains represent gains from the sale or contribution
    of development projects including land. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we sold seven completed development
    projects totaling 0.5 million square feet and three land
    parcels for approximately $115.1 million, resulting in an
    after-tax gain of $28.6 million. In addition, we
    contributed 15 completed development projects totaling
    3.6 million square feet and two land parcels into AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC,
    AMB Europe Fund  I, FCP-FIS, AMB DFS Fund I, LLC,
    and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., five of our unconsolidated
    co-investment ventures. As a result of these contributions, we
    recognized an aggregate after-tax gain of $95.7 million
    representing the portion of our interest in the contributed
    assets acquired by the third-party co-investors for cash. During
    2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects
    totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an
    aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an
    after-tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006,
    we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with
    the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of
    $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the
    co-investment venture partner’s share. During 2006, we also
    contributed a total of ten completed development projects into
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Four projects totaling
    approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into
    AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately
    0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB-SGP
    Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately
    0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel
    was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of
    these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after-tax gain
    of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest
    in the contributed property acquired by the third-party
    investors for cash. During the year ended December 31,
    2007, we contributed 4.2 million square feet in operating
    properties into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, contributed a
    0.2 million square foot operating property into AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and contributed an
    operating property aggregating approximately 0.1 million
    square feet into

AMB-SGP

Mexico, LLC, for a total of approximately $524.9 million.
    As a result of these contributions, we recognized gains from
    contribution of real estate interests of approximately
    $73.4 million, representing the portion of our interest in
    the contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors
    for cash. The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated
    co-investment ventures of approximately $15.7 million was
    primarily due to a decrease in gains from the disposition of
    real estate by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures
    partially offset by the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P. Other income increased
    approximately $10.4 million from the prior year due
    primarily to an increase in the gain on currency remeasurement
    of approximately $3.9 million, an increase in insurance
    proceeds of approximately $2.9 million related to losses
    from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and an increase in interest
    income of $2.3 million. The decrease in interest expense,
    including amortization, was due primarily to decreased
    borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85%
    Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The
    increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the then newly
    issued shares. On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership
    redeemed all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and
    all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series K Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. In addition, on
    April 17, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our
    subsidiaries, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00%
    Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units. As a result of the redemptions and
    repurchase, we recognized a reduction of income available to

    Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00%
    Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in
    income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for
    the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase.

U.S. industrial same store revenues increased
    $23.6 million from the prior year despite the decrease of
    $66.6 million in same store revenues due to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to
    improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various
    markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 29
    properties, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square
    feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 31
    properties, aggregating approximately 7.3 million square
    feet. The increase in rental revenues from development was
    primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our
    development projects where development activities have been
    substantially completed as well as an increase in the number of
    development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental
    revenues from properties that have



been contributed to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, and
    accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our
    consolidated financial statements, and development projects that
    have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of
    the same store operating pool of properties.

Non-U.S. industrial

revenues increased approximately $21.1 million from the
    prior year due primarily to the stabilization of properties in
    Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France,
    Germany, and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was
    primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees
    from additional assets held in co-investment ventures, which
    were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions
    of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received
    incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which
    $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared
    to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of
    AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

Same store properties’ operating expenses increased
    $7.8 million from the prior year, despite the decrease of
    $14.6 million in same store operating expenses due to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P., effective October 1, 2006, due primarily to increased
    insurance costs, utility expenses, repair and maintenance
    expenses, and other non-reimbursable expenses. The 2005
    acquisitions consisted of 29 properties, aggregating
    approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006
    acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating
    approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial
    expenses include expenses from divested properties that have
    been contributed to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, and
    accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our
    consolidated financial statements, and development properties
    that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet
    part of the same store operating pool of properties.

Non-U.S. industrial

property operating costs increased approximately
    $5.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the
    stabilization of properties in Japan and the continued
    acquisition of properties in France, Germany, and Mexico. The
    increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the
    increase in our net investment in real estate during the year.
    The increase in general and administrative expenses was
    primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense as a
    result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and
    executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our
    international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine.
    Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to
    third parties associated with our co-investment ventures. The
    2006 impairment loss was taken on several non-core assets as a
    result of leasing activities and changes in the economic
    environment and the holding



period of certain assets. Other expenses decreased approximately
    $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a
    decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation
    plan and a decrease in certain deal costs.

Development profits represent gains from the sale of development
    projects and land as part of our development-for-sale program.
    The increase in development profits was due to increased
    disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we
    sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling
    approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale
    price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of
    $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received
    approximately $0.4 million in connection with the
    condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of
    $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the
    co-investment venture partner’s share. During 2006, we also
    contributed a total of ten completed development projects into
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Four projects totaling
    approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into
    AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately
    0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB-SGP
    Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately
    0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel
    was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of
    these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after-tax gain
    of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest
    in the contributed property acquired by the third-party
    investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and
    five development projects, aggregating approximately
    0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of
    $155.2 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of
    $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final
    proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in
    2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development
    project into an unconsolidated co-investment venture, AMB-SGP
    Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of
    $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in
    the contributed property acquired by the third-party co-investor
    for cash. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate
    interests resulted primarily from our contribution of
    $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at
    contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed
    unconsolidated co-investment venture, AMB Japan Fund I,
    L.P. The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures was primarily due to gains
    of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures during 2006. During 2005,
    such gains were $5.5 million. In addition, effective
    October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., resulted in an increase of
    approximately $5.1 million in equity in earnings of
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. The increases in 2006
    were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. The increase in other
    income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and
    an increase in property management income due to the expansion
    of our property management activities. The increase in interest
    expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased
    borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt.

    2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred
    stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition,
    during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II,
    L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its
    outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
    Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75%
    Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95%
    Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00%
    Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in
    income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for
    the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Balance Sheet Strategy.

In general, we use
    unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and
    common equity (issued by us

and/or

the
    operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our
    wholly-owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non-recourse,
    secured debt encumbering our wholly-owned assets and replace
    that debt with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing
    the co-investment ventures, in general, we use

non-recourse,

secured debt to capitalize our co-investment ventures.

We currently expect that our principal sources of working
    capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and
    renovation of properties will include:

•

retained earnings and cash flow from operations;

•

private capital from co-investment partners;

•

net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed
    development projects to our co-investment ventures;

•

net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value-added
    conversion projects and land to third parties;

•

net proceeds from divestitures of properties;

•

proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities
    offerings;

•

borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities;

•

other forms of secured or unsecured financing; and

•

proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including
    issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries).



We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will
    include:

•

working capital;

•

development, expansion and renovation of properties;

•

acquisitions;

•

debt service; and

•

dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred
    stock and limited partnership units.

Cash flows.

As of December 31, 2007, cash
    provided by operating activities was $240.5 million as
    compared to $335.9 million for the same period in 2006.
    This change is primarily due to changes in our assets and
    liabilities offset by gains from sales and contributions of real
    estate interests, net, and an increase in operating
    distributions received by unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
    Cash used in investing activities was $632.2 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash used
    for investing activities of $880.6 million for the same
    period in 2006. This change is primarily due to a decrease in
    cash used for property acquisitions, offset by additions to
    interests in unconsolidated co-investment ventures and additions
    to land and buildings. Cash provided by financing activities was
    $420.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    as compared to cash provided by financing activities of
    $483.6 million for the same period in 2006. This change is
    due primarily to an increase in payments on other debt, credit
    facilities, senior debt, the cost of repurchase of preferred
    units, and a decrease in proceeds from issuances of senior debt,
    and contributions from co-investment partners. This activity was
    partially offset by the issuance of common stock and increased
    borrowings on secured debt and credit facilities.

We believe our sources of working capital, specifically our cash
    flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured
    credit facilities and our ability to access private and public
    debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our
    liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The
    unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    dividends on, and the market price of, our stock.

Property Divestitures.

During 2007, we
    divested ourselves of three industrial properties, aggregating
    approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate
    price of $120.0 million, with a resulting net gain of
    approximately $2.0 million and a gain of approximately
    $60.0 million associated with the sale of two value-added
    conversion projects.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized
    development profits of approximately $95.7 million, as a
    result of the contribution of 15 completed development projects
    and approximately 82 acres of land to AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB
    Japan Fund I, L.P. In addition, we recognized development
    profits of approximately $28.6 million as a result of the
    sale of seven development projects and 76 acres of land
    during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate
    Interests.

During 2007, we contributed operating
    properties for approximately $524.9 million, aggregating
    approximately 4.5 million square feet, into AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. and AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. We recognized a gain of
    $73.4 million on the contributions, representing the
    portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired
    by the third-party investors for cash. During 2006, there were
    no comparable events.

Properties Held for Contribution.

As of
    December 31, 2007, we held for contribution to
    co-investment ventures 17 properties with an aggregate net book
    value of $488.3 million, which, when contributed, will
    reduce our average ownership interest in these projects from
    approximately 90% currently to an expected range of

15-20%.

Properties Held for Divestiture.

As of
    December 31, 2007, we held for divestiture five properties
    with an aggregate net book value of $40.5 million. These
    properties either are not in our core markets or do not meet our
    current investment objectives, or are included as part of our
    development-for-sale or value-added conversion programs. The
    divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of
    acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Properties held
    for divestiture are stated at the lower of cost or estimated
    fair value less costs to sell.

Co-investment Ventures.

Through the operating
    partnership, we enter into co-investment ventures with
    institutional investors. These co-investment ventures are
    managed by our private capital group and provide us with an
    additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions,
    development projects and renovation projects, as well as private
    capital income. We consolidate these co-investment ventures for
    financial reporting purposes when they are



not variable interest entities and when we are the sole managing
    general partner and control all major operating decisions.
    However, in certain cases, our co-investment ventures are
    unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating
    decisions and the general partners do not have significant
    rights under the EITF Issue

No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

.

Third-party equity interests in the co-investment ventures are
    reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial
    statements. As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately
    83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the
    total operating and development portfolio) through our
    consolidated and unconsolidated

co-investment

ventures. We may make additional investments through these
    co-investment ventures or new co-investment ventures in the
    future and presently plan to do so.

On June 30, 2007, we exercised our option to purchase the
    remaining equity interest held by an unrelated third party,
    based on the fair market value as stipulated in the
    co-investment venture agreement, in AMB Pier One, LLC, for a
    nominal amount. AMB Pier One, LLC, is a co-investment venture
    related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier that houses our
    global headquarters in San Francisco, California. As a
    result, the investment was consolidated as of June 30, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, we also had an approximate 39.0%
    unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real
    estate company. G.Accion provides management and development
    services for industrial, retail, residential and office
    properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2007,
    one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in
    IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income
    trust specializing in aviation-related real estate at
    Canada’s leading international airports. These equity
    investments of approximately $2.1 million and
    $2.7 million, respectively, are included in other assets on
    the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006.

Common and Preferred Equity.

We have
    authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred
    stock, of which the following series were designated as of
    December 31, 2007: 1,595,337 shares of series D
    cumulative redeemable preferred, of which none are outstanding;
    2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable
    preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding;
    2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable
    preferred, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares
    of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which
    are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P
    cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding.



As of December 31, 2007, $107.5 million in preferred
    units with a weighted average rate of 6.63% become callable in
    2008.

On April 17, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in
    which, as of January 1, 2008, AMB Property Holding
    Corporation, a Maryland corporation and our direct subsidiary,
    owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the
    operating partnership owns an approximate 92% common limited
    partnership interest, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding
    8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units from a single institutional investor for an
    aggregate price of $25.6 million, including accrued and
    unpaid distributions. In connection with this repurchase, we
    reclassified all 510,000 shares of our 8.00% Series I
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as preferred stock.

On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all
    800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single
    institutional investor for an aggregate price of
    $40.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions.
    In connection with this redemption, we reclassified all
    800,000 shares of our 7.95% Series J Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock as preferred stock.

On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all
    800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series K Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single
    institutional investor for an aggregate price of
    $40.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions.
    In connection with this redemption, we reclassified all
    800,000 shares of our 7.95% Series K Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock as preferred stock.

On January 29, 2007, all of the outstanding 7.75%
    Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units of AMB Property II, L.P. were transferred from
    one institutional investor to another institutional investor. In
    connection with that transfer, on February 22, 2007, AMB
    Property II, L.P. amended the terms of the series D
    preferred units to, among other things, change the rate
    applicable to the series D preferred units from 7.75% to
    7.18% and change the date prior to which the series D
    preferred units may not be redeemed from May 5, 2004 to

    of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately
    $472.1 million, which were contributed to the operating
    partnership in exchange for the issuance of approximately
    8.4 million general partnership units. As a result of the
    common stock issuance, there was a significant reallocation of
    partnership interests due to the difference in our stock price
    at issuance as compared to the book value per share at the time
    of issuance. We intend to use the proceeds from the offering for
    general corporate purposes and, over the long term, to expand
    our global development business.

On September 21, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., repurchased

On August 25, 2006, we issued and sold
    2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative

    Units.

    Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution to AMB
    Property II, L.P of certain parcels of land that are located in
    multiple markets. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert

    Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating
    partnership, and sold all of the series N preferred units

    Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on
    July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem
    all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable
    Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all
    accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date.

In December 2005, our board of directors approved a two-year
    common stock repurchase program for the discretionary repurchase
    of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. During the
    year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased approximately
    1.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate
    price of $53.4 million at a weighted average price of
    $49.87 per share. We have the authorization to repurchase up to
    an additional $146.6 million of our common stock under this
    program. On December 18, 2007, we extended this program
    through December 31, 2009.

Debt.

In order to maintain financial
    flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through
    market cycles, we presently intend over the long term to operate
    with an our share of total debt-to-our share of total market
    capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of
    December 31, 2007, our share of total debt-to-our share of
    total market capitalization ratio was 34.4%. (See footnote 1 to
    the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of
    “our share of total market capitalization,”
    “market equity” and “our share of total
    debt.”) However, we typically finance our co-investment
    ventures with secured debt at a loan-to-value ratio of

50-65%

per
    our co-investment venture agreements. Additionally, we currently
    intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an
    investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless
    of these policies, however, our organizational



documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may
    incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate
    these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances
    could arise that could render us unable to comply with these
    policies.

As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate principal amount of
    our secured debt was $1.5 billion, excluding unamortized
    debt premiums of $4.2 million. Of the $1.5 billion of
    secured debt, $1.1 billion is secured by properties in our
    co-investment ventures. The secured debt is generally
    non-recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 1.1% to
    9.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.6%) and final
    maturity dates ranging from January 2008 to February 2024. As of
    December 31, 2007, $1.0 billion of the secured debt
    obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average
    interest rate of 6.3%, while the remaining $426.0 million
    bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average
    interest rate of 3.8%).

On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P.,
    a Delaware limited partnership, which is one of our
    subsidiaries, entered into a loan agreement for a
    $305 million secured financing. On the same day, pursuant
    to the loan agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered
    four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which matures
    on March 5, 2012. One note has a principal of
    $160 million and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%.
    The second is a $40 million note with an interest rate of
    81 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate. The third
    note has a principal of $84 million and a fixed interest
    rate of 5.90%. The fourth note has a principal of
    $21 million and bears interest at a rate of 135 basis
    points above the one-month LIBOR rate.

As of December 31, 2007, the operating partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 6.1% and had an average term of 4.2 years. The
    unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various
    covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants,
    including compliance with financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and
    limitations on mergers or consolidations.

We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with
    respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to
    refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay
    them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our
    cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our
    stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity.
    Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at
    the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to
    make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest
    rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to
    that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased
    interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition,
    results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends
    on, and the market price of, our stock.

Credit Facilities.

The operating partnership
    has a $550.0 million (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds
    sterling or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured
    revolving credit facility, which bore a weighted average
    interest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2007. This facility
    matures on June 1, 2010. We are a guarantor of the
    operating partnership’s obligations under the credit
    facility. The line carries a one-year extension option and can
    be increased to up to $700.0 million upon certain
    conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a
    margin, based on the operating partnership’s long-term debt
    rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31,
    2007, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The
    four-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component,
    under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in
    U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The
    operating partnership uses the credit facility principally for
    acquisitions, funding development activity and general working
    capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange
    rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was
    $259.4 million and the remaining amount available was
    $273.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of
    $16.8 million.

AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating
    partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit
    facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion
    Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect at
    December 31, 2007, equaled approximately
    $492.4 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted
    average interest rate of 1.2%. We, along with the operating
    partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K.
    under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any
    other entity in which the operating partnership directly or
    indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from
    time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit
    agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the
    facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties
    and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South
    Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit



facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the
    borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate
    assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets.
    The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one-year
    extension option. The extension option is subject to the
    satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an
    extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments
    under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is
    generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit
    rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt and
    was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2007. In
    addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly
    amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating
    partnership’s long-term debt, and was 15 basis points
    of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of
    December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange
    rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was
    $399.5 million in U.S. dollars. The credit agreement
    contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting
    requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and
    negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of
    liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations.

On July 16, 2007, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries
    and the operating partnership, each acting as a borrower, with
    us and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into a
    fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a
    $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that
    replaced the existing $250 million unsecured revolving
    credit facility. The fifth amended and restated credit facility
    amends the fourth amended and restated credit facility to, among
    other things, increase the facility amount to $500 million
    with an option to further increase the facility to
    $750 million, to extend the maturity date to July 2011 and
    to allow for future borrowing in Indian rupees. We, along with
    the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such
    subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the operating
    partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from
    time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to our credit
    facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have
    the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under
    the credit facility. The credit facility includes a
    multi-currency component under which up to $500.0 million
    can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore
    dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, and Euros
    with the ability to add Indian rupees. The line, which matures
    in July 2011 and carries a one-year extension option, can be
    increased to up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions
    and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the
    outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally
    LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating
    partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt, which was
    60 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an
    annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating
    partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. The
    borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund
    the acquisition and development of properties and general
    working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility was approximately
    $217.2 million and bore a weighted average interest rate of
    5.3%. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants,
    including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of
    specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and
    negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of
    liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations.

On December 8, 2006, we executed a 228.0 million Euros
    facility agreement (approximately $303.3 million in
    U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12,
    2007, the date the facility was assumed by AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, as discussed below), which provides that
    certain of our affiliates may borrow either acquisition loans,
    up to a 100.0 million Euros sub-limit (approximately
    $133.0 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange
    rate at June 12, 2007), or secured term loans, in
    connection with properties located in France, Germany, the
    Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy or Spain. On
    March 21, 2007, we increased the facility amount limit from
    228.0 million Euros to 328.0 million Euros. Drawings
    under the term facility bear interest at a rate of 65 basis
    points over EURIBOR and may occur until, and mature on,
    April 30, 2014. Drawings under the acquisition loan
    facility bear interest at a rate of 75 basis points over
    EURIBOR and are repayable within six months of the date of
    advance, unless extended. We initially guaranteed the
    acquisition loan facility and were the carve-out indemnitor in
    respect of the term loans. In accordance with the terms of the
    facility agreement, on June 12, 2007, AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, assumed, and the operating partnership was
    released from, all of the operating partnership’s
    obligations and liabilities under the facility agreement. On
    June 12, 2007, there were 267.0 million Euros
    (approximately $355.2 million in U.S. dollars, using
    the exchange rate at June 12, 2007) of term loans and
    no acquisition loans outstanding under the facility agreement.

Our definition of “total market capitalization” is
    total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus
    market equity. Our definition of “our share of total market
    capitalization” is our share of total debt plus preferred
    equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. Our
    definition of “market equity” is the total number of
    outstanding shares of our common stock and common limited
    partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of
    our common stock as of December 31, 2007. Our definition of
    “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation
    preferences. Our share of total book capitalization is defined
    as our share of total debt plus minority interests to preferred
    unitholders and limited partnership unitholders plus
    stockholders’ equity. Our share of total debt is the pro
    rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity
    interest in each of the consolidated and unconsolidated
    co-investment ventures holding the debt. We believe that our
    share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which
    enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage
    and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In
    addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt
    to that of other companies that do not consolidate their
    co-investment ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended
    to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under
    any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the co-investment
    ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to
    total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see
    the table of debt maturities and capitalization above.



Liquidity

As of December 31, 2007, we had $220.2 million in cash
    and cash equivalents and $649.5 million of additional
    available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of
    December 31, 2007, we had $30.2 million in restricted
    cash.

Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the
    quarter ended December 31, 2007 of $0.50 per share of
    common stock, and the operating partnership announced its
    intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter
    ended December 31, 2007 of $0.50 per common unit. The
    dividends and distributions were payable on January 7, 2008
    to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 21,
    2007. The series L, M, O and P preferred stock dividends
    were payable on January 15, 2008 to stockholders of record
    on January 4, 2008. The following table sets forth the

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from
    operations, will not allow us to pay all of our debt as it comes
    due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net
    proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as
    property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain
    future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to
    obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price
    of, our stock.

Development Pipeline.

As of December 31,
    2007, we had 56 industrial projects in our development pipeline,
    which are expected to total approximately 17.8 million
    square feet and have an aggregate estimated investment of
    $1.7 billion upon completion. We have an additional 12
    development projects available for sale or contribution totaling
    approximately 4.2 million square feet, with an aggregate
    estimated investment of $304.7 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, we and our co-investment venture
    partners have funded an aggregate of $1.2 billion and
    needed to fund an estimated additional $500 million in
    order to complete our development pipeline. The development
    pipeline, at December 31, 2007, included projects expected
    to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition
    to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of
    2,535 acres of land for future development or



sale, approximately 91% of which is located in the Americas. We
    currently estimate that these 2,535 acres of land could
    support approximately 44.0 million square feet of future
    development.

Lease Commitments.

We have entered into
    operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily
    on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms
    from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements
    subject to ground leases are amortized ratably over the lesser
    of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future
    minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating
    leases in effect as of December 31, 2007 were as follows

Co-investment Ventures.

Through the operating
    partnership, we enter into co-investment ventures with
    institutional investors. These co-investment ventures are
    managed by our private capital group and provide us with an
    additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development
    projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital
    income. As of December 31, 2007, we had investments in
    co-investment ventures with a gross book value of
    $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial
    reporting purposes, and net equity investments in five
    significant unconsolidated co-investment ventures of
    $274.9 million and a gross book value of $4.4 billion.
    As of December 31, 2007, we may make additional capital
    contributions to current and planned co-investment ventures of
    up to $151.0 million (using the exchange rates at
    December 31, 2007) pursuant to the terms of the
    co-investment venture agreements. From time to time, we may
    raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended unconsolidated
    co-investment venture formed in 2004 with institutional
    investors, which invests through a private real estate
    investment partnership, and for AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS,
    an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in
    2007 with institutional investors. This would increase our
    obligation to make additional capital commitments to these
    funds. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and the management
    regulations of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, we are obligated
    to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to each fund
    until such time when our total equity commitment is greater than
    $150.0 million or 150.0 million Euros, respectively,
    at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total
    equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with
    cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities,
    debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property
    divestitures, which could adversely affect our cash flow.

Captive Insurance Company.

In December 2001,
    we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance
    coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible
    under our third-party policies. The captive insurance company is
    one element of our overall risk management program. We
    capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory
    requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of our
    properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may
    be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to
    third-party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be
    reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms.
    Through this structure, we think that we have more comprehensive
    insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise
    be available in the market.

Potential Contingent and Unknown
    Liabilities.

Contingent and unknown liabilities
    may include the following:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our
    acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our
    formation or acquisition transactions;



•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
    of business; and

•

tax liabilities.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Standby Letters of Credit.

As of
    December 31, 2007, we had provided approximately
    $24.2 million in letters of credit, of which
    $16.8 million were provided under the operating
    partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit
    facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under
    certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other
    commitments.

Guarantees and Contribution
    Obligations.

Excluding parent guarantees
    associated with unsecured debt or contribution obligations as
    discussed in Notes 5 and 9, we had outstanding guarantees
    and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of
    $405.2 million as described below.

As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding guarantees in
    the amount of $95.9 million in connection with certain
    acquisitions. As of December 31, 2007, we also guaranteed
    $41.2 million and $107.9 million on outstanding loans
    on five of our consolidated co-investment ventures and two of
    our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, respectively.

Also, we have entered into contribution agreements with certain
    of our unconsolidated co-investment venture funds. These
    contribution agreements require us to make additional capital
    contributions to the applicable co-investment venture fund upon
    certain defaults by the co-investment venture of certain of its
    debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital
    contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than our share of the co-investment venture’s debt
    obligation or the value of our share of any property securing
    such debt. Our contribution obligations under these agreements
    will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the
    fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the
    debt and obtained by the lender upon default. Our potential
    obligations under these contribution agreements are
    $160.2 million as of December 31, 2007.

Performance and Surety Bonds.

As of
    December 31, 2007, we had outstanding performance and
    surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $15.2 million. These
    bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development
    projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations
    and the construction of certain real property improvements and
    infrastructure. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and
    expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of
    the improvements and infrastructure.

Promoted Interests and Other Contractual
    Obligations.

Upon the achievement of certain
    return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may
    be obligated to make payments to certain of our co-investment
    venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their
    contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal
    course of our business, we enter into various contracts with
    third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay
    promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of
    certain events.



SUPPLEMENTAL
    EARNINGS MEASURES

Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Funds From
    Operations Per Share and Unit
    (“FFOPS”).

We believe that net income,
    as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings
    measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, and
    FFO per share and unit, or FFOPS, to be useful supplemental
    measures of our operating performance. We define FFOPS as FFO
    per fully diluted weighted average share of our common stock and
    operating partnership units. We calculate FFO as net income,
    calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less gains (or
    losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment
    purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments
    to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We do not adjust FFO to
    eliminate the effects of non-recurring charges. We include the
    gains from development, including those from value-added
    conversion projects, before depreciation recapture, as a
    component of FFO. We believe that value-added conversion
    dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be
    included in FFO, consistent with the real estate investment
    trust industry’s long standing practice to include gains on
    the sale of land in FFO. However, our interpretation of FFO or
    FFOPS may not be consistent with the views of others in the real
    estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be a
    divergence from the NAREIT definition, and may not be comparable
    to FFO or FFOPS reported by other real estate investment trusts
    that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we
    do.

In connection with the formation of a co-investment venture, we
    may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to
    contribute these assets to the newly formed venture. Some of the
    properties held for contribution may, under certain
    circumstances, be required to be depreciated under
    U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, we intend to
    include in our calculation of FFO gains or losses related to the
    contribution of previously depreciated real estate to
    co-investment ventures. Although such a change, if instituted,
    will be a departure from the current NAREIT definition, we
    believe such a calculation of FFO will better reflect the value
    created as a result of the contributions. To date, we have not
    included gains or losses from the contribution of previously
    depreciated warehoused assets in FFO.

AMB believes that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful supplemental
    measures of its operating performance because historical cost
    accounting for real estate assets in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate
    assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through
    depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real
    estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and
    other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have
    considered presentation of operating results for real estate
    companies that use historical cost accounting to be
    insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of
    operating performance for real estate investment trusts that
    exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among
    other items, from net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP. We
    believe that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the
    required U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in
    improving the understanding of operating results of real estate
    investment trusts among the investing public and making
    comparisons of operating results among such companies more
    meaningful. We consider FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for
    reviewing comparative operating and financial performance
    because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of
    previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real
    estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the
    investing public compare the operating performance of a
    company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
    other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely
    used measures of operating performance of real estate investment
    trusts, these measures do not represent cash flow from
    operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should
    not be considered as alternatives to those measures in
    evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS
    also do not consider the costs associated with capital
    expenditures related to our real estate assets nor are FFO or
    FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our
    future cash requirements.

    approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of one
    value-added conversion project.



SS NOI.

We believe that net income, as defined
    by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we
    consider same-store net operating income, or SS NOI, and
    cash-basis SS NOI to be useful supplemental measures of our
    operating performance. Properties that are considered part of
    the same store pool include all properties that were owned, or
    owned and managed, as the case may be, as of the end of both the
    current and prior year reporting periods and exclude development
    properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The
    same store pool is set annually and excludes properties
    purchased and developments stabilized after December 31,
    2005 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or
    properties that have been substantially complete for at least
    12 months). In deriving SS NOI, we define net operating
    income as rental revenues, including reimbursements, less
    property operating expenses, both of which are calculated in
    accordance with GAAP. Property operating expenses exclude
    depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses
    and interest expense. In calculating cash-basis SS NOI, we
    exclude straight-line rents and amortization of lease
    intangibles from the calculation of SS NOI. We consider
    cash-basis SS NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental
    performance measure because it reflects the operating
    performance of our real estate portfolio excluding effects of
    non-cash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual
    cash-basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In
    addition, we believe that SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI help the
    investing public compare our operating performance with that of
    other companies. While SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI are relevant
    and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate
    investment trusts, they do not represent cash flow from
    operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be
    considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our
    liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI
    also do not reflect general and administrative expenses,
    interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital
    expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and
    construction activities that could materially impact our results
    from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI and
    cash-basis SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real
    estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for
    calculating these measures.

The following table reconciles SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI from
    net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in
    thousands):

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market
    prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our
    future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing
    market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching
    projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing
    activities with projected cash outflows for debt service,
    acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to
    stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The
    majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which
    minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to
    market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection
    with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings
    and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval,
    thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could
    adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2007,
    we had one outstanding interest rate swap with a notional amount
    of $25.0 million (in U.S. dollars). See
    “Financial Instruments” below.

The table below summarizes the maturities and interest rates
    associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding
    before net unamortized debt discounts of $5.2 million as of
    December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands):

If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased
    or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest
    cost on the variable rate debt would be $5.0 million (net
    of the swap) annually. As of December 31, 2007, the book
    value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated
    debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.5 billion and
    $3.6 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of
    current market interest rates.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, variable rate debt
    comprised 39.0% and 37.1%, respectively, of all our outstanding
    debt. Variable rate debt was $1.4 billion and
    $1.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding
    balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our
    outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated
    with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations.

Financial Instruments.

We record all
    derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in
    non-functional currencies, we may use derivative financial
    instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our
    derivative financial instrument in effect at December 31,
    2007 was one interest rate swap hedging cash flows of variable
    rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD).

International Operations.

Our exposure to
    market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk.
    The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our
    subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The
    functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the
    United States, other than Mexico, is generally the local
    currency



of the country in which the entity or property is located,
    mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our
    subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
    U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into
    U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the
    exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We
    translate income statement accounts using the average exchange
    rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions
    using the rate on the transaction date. The gains resulting from
    the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’
    equity and totaled $14.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated
    in currencies other than their functional currency. In these
    instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at
    the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities
    are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the
    period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the
    average exchange rate for the period. We also record gains or
    losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third
    party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s
    functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash
    flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the
    exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. For
    the year ended December 31, 2007, unrealized and realized
    gains from remeasurement and translation included in our results
    of operations were $3.9 million.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures and Changes to Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

As required by

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried
    out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the
    design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    that were in effect as of the end of the year covered by this
    report. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
    each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective at a reasonable assurance level as of
    December 31, 2007.

No changes were made in our internal control over financial
    reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting.

Our management has used the framework set forth in the report
    entitled “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
    Based on our evaluation under the framework in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework,” our management
    has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
    was effective as of December 31, 2007. The effectiveness of
    our internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of AMB Property Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of AMB Property
    Corporation (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)
    presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
    consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Item 9A. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

, on January 1, 2007. As discussed in
    Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

, on January 1,
    2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1.

Organization
    and Formation of the Company

AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the
    “Company”), commenced operations as a fully integrated
    real estate company effective with the completion of its initial
    public offering on November 26, 1997. The Company elected
    to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under
    Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its
    taxable year ended December 31, 1997, and believes its
    current organization and method of operation will enable it to
    maintain its status as a REIT. The Company, through its
    controlling interest in its subsidiary, AMB Property, L.P., a
    Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating
    Partnership”), is engaged in the acquisition, development
    and operation of industrial properties in key distribution
    markets throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. The Company
    uses the terms “industrial properties” or
    “industrial buildings” to describe various types of
    industrial properties in its portfolio and uses these terms
    interchangeably with the following: logistics facilities,
    centers or warehouses; distribution facilities, centers or
    warehouses; High Throughput
    Distribution

®

(HTD

®

)
    facilities; or any combination of these terms. The Company uses
    the term “owned and managed” to describe assets in
    which it has at least a 10% ownership interest, for which it is
    the property or asset manager, and which it intends to hold for
    the long-term. Unless the context otherwise requires, the
    “Company” means AMB Property Corporation, the
    Operating Partnership and their other controlled subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company owned an approximate
    96.1% general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership,
    excluding preferred units. The remaining approximate 3.9% common
    limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated
    investors and certain current and former directors and officers
    of the Company. As the sole general partner of the Operating
    Partnership, the Company has full, exclusive and complete
    responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and
    control of the Operating Partnership. Net operating results of
    the Operating Partnership are allocated after preferred unit
    distributions based on the respective partners’ ownership
    interests. Certain properties are owned by the Company through
    limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other
    entities. The ownership of such properties through such entities
    does not materially affect the Company’s overall ownership
    interests in the properties.

Through the Operating Partnership, the Company enters into
    co-investment ventures with institutional investors. These
    co-investment ventures provide the Company with an additional
    source of capital and income. As of December 31, 2007, the
    Company had investments in five significant consolidated and
    five significant unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

Any references to the number of buildings, square footage,
    customers and occupancy in the financial statement footnotes are
    unaudited.

AMB Capital Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
    (“AMB Capital Partners”), provides real estate
    investment services to clients on a fee basis. Headlands Realty
    Corporation, a Maryland corporation, conducts a variety of
    businesses that include development projects available for sale
    or contribution to third parties and incremental income
    programs. IMD Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
    conducts a variety of businesses that also includes development
    projects available for sale or contribution to third parties.
    AMB Capital Partners, Headlands Realty Corporation and IMD
    Holding Corporation are direct subsidiaries of the Operating
    Partnership.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company owned or had
    investments in, on a consolidated basis or through
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures, properties and
    development projects expected to total approximately
    147.7 million square feet (13.7 million square meters)
    in 45 markets within 14 countries. Additionally, as of
    December 31, 2007, the Company managed, but did not have a
    significant ownership interest in, industrial and other
    properties, totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements included herein have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows of the Company, its wholly-owned
    qualified REIT and taxable REIT subsidiaries, the Operating
    Partnership and co-investment ventures, in which the Company has
    a controlling interest. Third-party equity interests in the
    Operating Partnership and co-investment ventures are reflected
    as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements.
    The Company also has non-controlling partnership interests in
    unconsolidated real estate co-investment ventures, which are
    accounted for under the equity method. All significant
    intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications.

Certain items in the
    consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been
    reclassified to conform to current classifications.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless
    circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which
    case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is
    made to reduce it to its estimated fair value. The Company also
    regularly reviews the impact of above or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions,
    and records an intangible asset or liability accordingly.
    Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed
    for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    For properties held for use, impairment is recognized when
    estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the
    property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is
    inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current
    and future economics and market conditions and the availability
    of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an
    adjustment to the carrying value of the Company’s
    long-lived assets could occur in the future period in which the
    assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired,
    the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its
    estimated fair value is charged to earnings. For properties held
    for sale, impairment is recognized when the carrying value of
    the property is less than its estimated fair value net of cost
    to sell. As a result of leasing activity and the economic
    environment, the Company re-evaluated the carrying value of its
    investments and recorded

F-7

    PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

impairment charges of $1.2 million, $6.3 million and
    $0.0 during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively, on certain of its investments.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local airport
    authorities, and subject to ground leases are depreciated over
    the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the
    underlying ground lease. The estimated lives and components of
    depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended
    December 31 are as follows (dollars in thousands):

The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase
    price of the property including legal fees and acquisition
    costs. Project costs directly associated with the development
    and construction of a real estate project, which include
    interest and property taxes, are capitalized as construction in
    progress. Capitalized interest related to construction projects
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $64.0 million, $42.9 million and $29.5 million,
    respectively.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Maintenance expenditures include
    painting and repair costs. The Company expenses costs as
    incurred and does not accrue in advance of planned major
    maintenance activities. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic useful life of assets are capitalized
    and include parking lot, HVAC and roof replacement costs.

Investments in Consolidated and Unconsolidated Co-investment
    Ventures.

Minority interests represent the
    limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and
    interests held by certain third parties in several real estate
    co-investment ventures, which own properties aggregating
    approximately 34.3 million square feet, which are
    consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Such investments
    are consolidated because the Company exercises significant
    control over major operating decisions such as approval of
    budgets, selection of property managers, asset management,
    investment activity and changes in financing.

The Company holds interests in both consolidated and
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. The Company determines
    consolidation based on standards set forth in FASB
    Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities

(FIN 46) or Emerging Issues Task
    Force (EITF) Issue

No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights.

For
    co-investment ventures that are variable interest entities as
    defined under FIN 46 where the Company is not the primary
    beneficiary, it does not consolidate the co-investment venture
    for financial

AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31,
    2007 and 2006

reporting purposes. Based on the guidance set forth in

EITF 04-5,

the Company consolidates certain co-investment venture
    investments because it exercises significant control over major
    operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of
    property managers, asset management, investment activity and
    changes in financing. For co-investment ventures under

EITF 04-5,

where the Company does not exercise significant control over
    major operating and management decisions, but where it exercises
    significant influence, the Company uses the equity method of
    accounting and does not consolidate the co-investment venture
    for financial reporting purposes.

The minority interests associated with certain of the
    Company’s consolidated co-investment ventures, that have
    finite lives under the terms of the partnership agreements
    represent mandatorily redeemable interests as defined in
    SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
    Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity

(“SFAS 150”). As of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, the aggregate book value of these minority interests
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet was
    $517.6 million and $555.2 million, respectively, and
    the Company believes that the aggregate settlement value of
    these interests was approximately $1.1 billion and
    $1.0 billion, respectively. This amount is based on the
    estimated liquidation values of the assets and liabilities and
    the resulting proceeds that the Company would distribute to its
    co-investment venture partners upon dissolution, as required
    under the terms of the respective partnership agreements.
    Subsequent changes to the estimated fair values of the assets
    and liabilities of the consolidated co-investment ventures will
    affect the Company’s estimate of the aggregate settlement
    value. The partnership agreements do not limit the amount that
    the minority partners would be entitled to in the event of
    liquidation of the assets and liabilities and dissolution of the
    respective partnerships.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with property purchases,
    Section 1031 exchange accounts and debt or real estate tax
    payments.

Accounts Receivable.

Accounts receivable
    includes all current accounts receivable, net of allowances,
    other accruals and deferred rent receivable of
    $73.0 million and $64.6 million as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company
    regularly reviews the credit worthiness of its customers and
    adjusts its allowance for doubtful accounts, straight-line rent
    receivable balance and tenant improvement and leasing costs
    amortization accordingly.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

Other real
    estate companies compete with the Company in its real estate
    markets. This results in competition for customers to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Company’s ability to lease space and
    on the amount of rent received. As of December 31, 2007,
    the Company does not have any material concentration of credit
    risk due to the diversification of its customers.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the straight-line method, which
    approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the
    related loan. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, deferred
    financing costs were $23.3 million and $20.4 million,
    respectively, net of accumulated amortization.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

The Company
    has classified as goodwill the cost in excess of fair value of
    the net assets of companies acquired in purchase transactions.
    As prescribed in SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets

, issued by the FASB, goodwill and certain
    indefinite lived intangible assets, including excess
    reorganization value and certain trademarks, are no longer
    amortized, but are subject to at least annual impairment
    testing. The Company tests annually (or more often, if
    necessary) for impairment under SFAS No. 142. The
    Company determined that there was no impairment to goodwill and
    intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2007.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31,
    2007 and 2006

Income Taxes.

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,

(FIN 48),
    which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in
    tax positions, as defined. FIN 48 seeks to reduce the
    diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the
    recognition and measurement related to accounting for income
    taxes. Adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not
    have a material effect on the Company’s financial
    statements. The tax years 2002 through 2006 remain open to
    examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the
    Company is subject.

Financial Instruments.

SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging
    Activities,

provides comprehensive guidelines for the
    recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging
    activities and, specifically, requires all derivatives to be
    recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income or loss. For revenues or expenses denominated in
    nonfunctional currencies, the Company may use derivative
    financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate
    risk. The Company’s derivative financial instruments in
    effect at December 31, 2007 consisted of one interest rate
    swap hedging cash flows of its variable rate borrowings based on
    U.S. Libor (USD) and Euribor (Europe). Adjustments to the
    fair value of this instrument for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 resulted in a loss of $1.7 million.
    This loss is included in other assets in the consolidated
    balance sheet and accumulated other comprehensive loss in the
    consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

Debt.

The Company’s debt includes both
    fixed and variable rate secured debt, unsecured fixed rate debt,
    unsecured variable rate debt and credit facilities. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Company at December 31,
    2007, the book value and the estimated fair value of the total
    debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.5 billion and
    $3.6 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the
    variable rate debt approximates fair value.

Debt Premiums.

Debt premiums represent the
    excess of the fair value of debt over the principal value of
    debt assumed in connection with the Company’s initial
    public offering and subsequent property acquisitions. The debt
    premiums are being amortized as an offset to interest expense
    over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest
    method. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the net
    unamortized debt premium was $4.2 million and
    $6.3 million, respectively, and are included as a component
    of secured debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Rental Revenues and Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts.

The Company, as a lessor, retains
    substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of the
    properties and accounts for its leases as operating leases.
    Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    term of the leases. Reimbursements from customers for real
    estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are
    incurred. The Company also records lease termination fees when a
    customer terminates its lease by executing a definitive
    termination agreement with the Company, vacates the premises and
    the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any
    conditions that must be met before the fee is due to the
    Company. In addition, the Company nets its allowance for
    doubtful accounts against rental income for financial reporting
    purposes. Such amounts totaled $3.7 million,
    $2.9 million and $3.2 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Private Capital Income.

Private capital income
    consists primarily of acquisition and development fees, asset
    management fees and priority distributions earned by AMB Capital
    Partners from co-investment ventures and clients. Private
    capital income also includes promoted interests and incentive
    distributions from the Operating Partnership’s
    co-investment ventures. The Company received incentive
    distributions of $0.5 million, $22.5 million of which
    $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., and
    $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund I, L.P., respectively, during the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Other Income.

Other income consists primarily
    of interest income from mortgages receivable and on cash and
    cash equivalents.

December 31,
    2007 and 2006

Development Profits, Net of Taxes.

When the
    Company disposes of its real estate entities’ interests,
    gains reported from the sale of these interests represent
    either: (i) the sale of partial interests in consolidated

co-investment

ventures to third-party investors for cash or (ii) the sale
    of partial interests in properties to unconsolidated
    co-investment ventures with third-party investors for cash.

Gains from Dispositions of Real Estate.

Gains
    and losses are recognized using the full accrual method. Gains
    related to transactions which do not meet the requirements of
    the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and
    recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria
    are met.

Discontinued Operations.

The Company reported
    real estate dispositions as discontinued operations separately
    as prescribed under the provisions of SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of

Long-Lived

Assets

(SFAS 144). The Company separately reports as
    discontinued operations the historical operating results
    attributable to operating properties sold or held for
    disposition and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition
    of the properties, which is included in development gains and
    gains from dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and
    minority interests, in the statement of operations. The
    consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also
    adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact
    on the Company’s previously reported consolidated financial
    position, net income or cash flows.

International Operations.

The U.S. dollar
    is the functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries
    operating in the United States and Mexico. Other than Mexico,
    the functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries
    operating outside the United States is generally the local
    currency of the country in which the entity or property is
    located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and
    losses. The Company’s subsidiaries whose functional
    currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial
    statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are
    translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial
    statement date. The Company translates income statement accounts
    using the average exchange rate for the period and significant
    nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction
    date. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    gains (losses) resulting from the translation were
    $14.8 million, ($0.2) million and ($1.8) million,
    respectively. These gains (losses) are included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity.

The Company’s international subsidiaries may have
    transactions denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currencies. In these instances, non-monetary assets
    and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate,
    monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange
    rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement
    accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the
    period. The Company also records gains or losses in the income
    statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in
    a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is
    settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more
    or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect
    when the transaction was initiated. These gains and losses have
    been immaterial over the past three years. Unrealized and
    realized gains (losses) from remeasurement and translation were
    $3.9 million, $0.8 million and $0.6 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. These gains are included in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In September
    2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements,

which defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. This Statement is effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. The Company does not believe that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on its
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115,

which permits entities to choose to measure
    many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
    that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. This Statement is effective for

Development Pipeline.

As of December 31,
    2007, the Company had 56 industrial projects in the development
    pipeline, which are expected to total approximately
    17.8 million square feet and have an aggregate estimated
    investment of $1.7 billion upon completion. The Company has
    an additional 12 development projects available for sale or
    contribution totaling approximately 4.2 million square
    feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of
    $304.7 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Company
    and its co-investment venture partners have funded an aggregate
    of $1.2 billion and needed to fund an estimated additional
    $500 million in order to complete its development pipeline.
    The development pipeline, at December 31, 2007, included
    projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of
    2009. In addition to the Company’s committed development
    pipeline, it holds a total of 2,535 acres of land for
    future development or sale, approximately 91% of which is
    located in the Americas. The Company currently estimates that
    these 2,535 acres of land could support approximately
    44.0 million square feet of future development.

Development
    Profits, Gains from Dispositions of Real Estate Interests and
    Discontinued Operations

Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate
    Interests.

During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Company contributed operating
    properties for approximately $524.9 million, aggregating
    approximately 4.5 million square feet, into AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. and AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. The Company recognized a gain of
    $73.4 million on the contributions, representing the
    portion of its interest in the contributed properties acquired
    by the third-party investors for cash. During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, there were no comparable events.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recognized development profits of approximately
    $95.7 million, as a result of the contribution of 15
    completed development projects and approximately 82 acres
    of land to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC,
    AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB DFS
    Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. In addition,
    the Company recognized development profits of approximately
    $28.6 million as a result of the sale of seven development
    projects and 76 acres of land during the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

On June 30, 2005, the Company formed AMB Japan Fund I,
    L.P. a co-investment venture with 13 institutional investors, in
    which the Company retained an approximate 20% interest. The 13
    institutional investors have committed 49.5 billion Yen
    ($443.1 million U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate
    at December 31, 2007) for an approximate 80% equity
    interest. The Company contributed $106.9 million (using

    properties, consisting of two properties, aggregating
    approximately 0.9 million square feet, to this fund. During
    2005, the Company recognized a gain of $17.8 million on the
    contribution, representing the portion of its interest in the
    contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for
    cash.

On December 31, 2004, the Company formed AMB-SGP Mexico,
    LLC, a co-investment venture with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte
    Ltd, a subsidiary of GIC Real Estate Pte. Ltd., the real estate
    investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment
    Corporation, in which the Company retained a 20% interest.
    During 2005, the Company recognized a gain of $1.3 million
    from disposition of real estate interests, representing the
    additional value received from the contribution of properties to
    AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC.

Properties Held for Contribution.

As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company held for contribution to
    co-investment ventures 17 properties with an aggregate net book
    value of $488.3 million, which, when contributed will
    reduce its average ownership interest in these projects from
    approximately 90% currently to an expected range of

15-20%.

Discontinued Operations.

The Company reports
    its property divestitures as discontinued operations separately
    as prescribed under the provisions of SFAS No. 144 ,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets

. Beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144 requires
    the Company to separately report as discontinued operations the
    historical operating results attributable to operating
    properties sold and held for disposition and the

applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties,
    which is included in development gains and gains from
    dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and minority
    interests, in the statement of operations. Although the
    application of SFAS No. 144 may affect the
    presentation of the Company’s results of operations for the
    periods that it has already reported in filings with the SEC,
    there will be no effect on its previously reported financial
    position, net income or cash flows.

During 2007, the Company divested itself of three industrial
    properties, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square
    feet, and two value-added conversion projects for an aggregate
    price of $120.0 million, with a resulting net gain of
    approximately $2.0 million and a gain of approximately
    $60.0 million, respectively.

During 2006, the Company divested itself of 17 industrial
    properties, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square
    feet, for an aggregate price of $175.3 million, with a
    resulting net gain of $42.6 million.

During 2005, the Company divested itself of 18 industrial
    properties and one retail center, aggregating approximately
    9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of
    $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of
    $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale
    of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund  I, L.P., for
    $618.5 million. The multi-investor fund owned approximately
    5.8 million square feet. The Company received cash and a
    distribution of an on-tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo
    Center I, in exchange for its 21% interest in the fund. The
    Company also received a net incentive distribution of
    approximately $26.4 million in cash which is classified
    under private capital revenues on the consolidated statement of
    operations.

Properties Held for Divestiture.

As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company held for divestiture five
    properties with an aggregate net book value of
    $40.5 million. These properties either are not in the
    Company’s core markets, do not meet its current investment
    objectives, or are included as part of its development-for-sale
    or value-added conversion programs. The divestitures of the
    properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and
    other customary conditions. Properties held for divestiture are
    stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs
    to sell.

The following summarizes the condensed results of operations of
    the properties held for divestiture and sold under

Secured debt generally requires monthly principal and interest
    payments. Some of the loans are cross-collateralized by multiple
    properties. The secured debt is collateralized by deeds of trust
    or mortgages on certain properties and is generally
    non-recourse. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31,
    2006, the total gross investment book value of those properties
    securing the debt was $2.1 billion and $2.6 billion,
    respectively, including $1.8 billion in consolidated
    co-investment ventures for each period. As of December 31,
    2007, $1,040 million of the secured debt obligations bore
    interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of
    6.3% while the remaining $426.0 million bore interest at
    variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%).

On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P.,
    a Delaware limited partnership, which is a subsidiary of the
    Company, entered into a loan agreement for a $305 million
    secured financing. On the same day, pursuant to the loan
    agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered four promissory
    notes to the two lenders, each of which matures on March 5,
    2012. One note has a principal of $160 million and an
    interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%. The second note has an
    initial principal borrowing of $40 million with a variable
    interest rate of 81 basis points above the one-month LIBOR
    rate. The third note has an initial principal borrowing of
    $84 million and a fixed interest rate of 5.90%. The fourth
    note has an initial principal borrowing of $21 million and
    bears interest at a variable rate of 135 basis points above
    the one-month LIBOR rate.

On December 8, 2006, the Operating Partnership executed a
    228.0 million Euros facility agreement (approximately
    $303.3 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange
    rate at June 12, 2007, the date the facility was assumed by
    AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, as discussed below), which
    provides that certain of the Company’s affiliates may
    borrow either acquisition loans, up to a 100.0 million
    Euros sub-limit (approximately $133.0 million in
    U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12,
    2007), or secured term loans, in connection with properties
    located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom,
    Italy or Spain. On March 21, 2007, the

Operating Partnership increased the facility amount limit from
    228.0 million Euros to 328.0 million Euros. Drawings
    under the term facility bear interest at a rate of 65 basis
    points over EURIBOR and may occur until, and mature on,
    April 30, 2014. Drawings under the acquisition loan
    facility bear interest at a rate of 75 basis points over
    EURIBOR and are repayable within six months of the date of
    advance, unless extended. The Operating Partnership initially
    guaranteed the acquisition loan facility and was the carve-out
    indemnitor in respect of the term loans. In accordance with the
    terms of the facility agreement, on June 12, 2007, AMB
    Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, assumed, and the Operating
    Partnership was released from, all of the Operating
    Partnership’s obligations and liabilities under the
    facility agreement. On June 12, 2007, there were
    267.0 million Euros (approximately $355.2 million in
    U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12,
    2007) of term loans and no acquisition loans outstanding
    under the facility agreement.

As of December 31, 2007, the Operating Partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 6.1% and had an average term of 4.2 years. The
    Company guarantees the Operating Partnership’s obligations
    with respect to its unsecured senior debt securities. The
    unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various
    covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants,
    including compliance with financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and
    limitations on mergers or consolidations. Management believes
    that the Company and the Operating Partnership were in
    compliance with their financial covenants as of
    December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
    $144.5 million outstanding in other debt which bore a
    weighted average interest rate of 6.0% and had an average term
    of 4.6 years. Other debt includes a $65.0 million
    non-recourse credit facility obtained by AMB Partners II, L.P.,
    a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, which had a
    $65.0 million balance outstanding as of December 31,
    2007. Other debt also includes a $70.0 million non-recourse
    credit facility obtained on August 24, 2007 by AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P., a subsidiary of the
    Operating Partnership, which had a $60.0 million balance
    outstanding as of December 31, 2007. The Company also had
    $19.5 million outstanding in other non-recourse debt.

The Operating Partnership has a $550.0 million (includes
    Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollar
    denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility
    which bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% at
    December 31, 2007. This facility matures on June 1,
    2010. The Company is a guarantor of the Operating
    Partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The
    line carries a one-year extension option and can be increased up
    to $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the
    Operating Partnership’s long-term debt rating, which was
    42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an
    annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four-year
    credit facility includes a multi-currency component, under which
    up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars,
    Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The Operating Partnership
    uses the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding
    development activity and general working capital requirements.
    As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this
    credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on
    December 31, 2007, was $259.4 million and the
    remaining amount available was $273.8 million, net of
    outstanding letters of credit of $16.8 million. The credit
    agreement contains affirmative covenants, including compliance
    with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of
    specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including
    limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on
    mergers or consolidations. Management believes that the Company
    and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with their
    financial covenants under this credit agreement at
    December 31, 2007.

AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the Operating
    Partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit
    facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion
    Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on
    December 31, 2007, equaled approximately
    $492.4 million U.S. dollars. This facility bore a
    weighted average interest rate of 1.2% at December 31,
    2007. The Company and the Operating Partnership guarantee the
    obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility,
    as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the

Operating Partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership
    interest and which is selected from time to time to be a
    borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. Generally,
    borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure
    all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility
    with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding
    such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June
    2010 and has a one-year extension option. The extension option
    is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the
    payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding
    commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on
    the credit rating of the Operating Partnership’s long-term
    debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31,
    2007. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in
    quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the
    Operating Partnership’s long-term debt, and was
    15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the
    facility as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31,
    2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the
    exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was
    $399.5 million in U.S. dollars. The credit agreement
    contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting
    requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and
    negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of
    liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. Management
    believes that the Company, the Operating Partnership and AMB
    Japan Finance Y.K. were in compliance with their financial
    covenants under this credit agreement at December 31, 2007.

On July 16, 2007, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and the
    Operating Partnership, each acting as a borrower, and the
    Company and the Operating Partnership, as guarantors, entered
    into a fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement for
    a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that
    replaced the existing $250 million unsecured revolving
    credit facility. The fifth amended and restated credit facility
    amends the fourth amended and restated credit facility to, among
    other things, increase the facility amount to $500 million
    with an option to further increase the facility to
    $750 million, to extend the maturity date to July 2011 and
    to allow for borrowing in Indian rupees. The Company, along with
    the Operating Partnership, guarantees the obligations for such
    subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the Operating
    Partnership that are selected by the Operating Partnership from
    time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to their credit
    facility. The credit facility includes a multi-currency
    component under which up to $500.0 million can be drawn in
    U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars,
    Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, and Euros with the
    ability to add Indian rupees. The line, which matures in July
    2011 and carries a one-year extension option, can be increased
    to up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions and the
    payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding
    commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus
    a margin, based on the credit rating of the Operating
    Partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt, which was
    60 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an
    annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the Operating
    Partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. As of
    December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit
    facility, using the exchange rates in effect at
    December 31, 2007, was approximately $217.2 million
    and it bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. The credit
    agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial
    reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial
    ratios by the Operating Partnership, and negative covenants,
    including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations
    on mergers or consolidations. Management believes that the
    Company and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with
    their financial covenants under this credit agreement at
    December 31, 2007.

Income
    Taxes

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code,
    commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1997.
    To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of
    organizational and operational requirements, including a
    requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its
    taxable income to its stockholders. It is management’s
    current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain
    the Company’s REIT status. As a REIT, the Company generally
    will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on net
    income it distributes currently to its stockholders. As such, no
    provision for federal income taxes has been included in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements. If the Company
    fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable

year, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular
    corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum
    tax) and may be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four
    subsequent taxable years. Even if the Company qualifies for
    taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state
    and local taxes on its income and excise taxes on its
    undistributed taxable income. The Company is required to pay
    federal and state income tax on its net taxable income, if any,
    from the activities conducted by the Company’s taxable REIT
    subsidiaries. Foreign income taxes are accrued for foreign
    countries in which the Company operates, as necessary.

AMB DFS Fund I, LLC is a co-investment partnership formed
    in 2006 with a subsidiary of GE Real Estate to build and sell
    properties.

(6)

The Company has a 39% unconsolidated equity interest in
    G.Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides
    management and development services for industrial, retail,
    residential and office properties in Mexico.

On December 30, 2004, the Company formed AMB-SGP Mexico,
    LLC, a co-investment venture with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte.
    Ltd., a subsidiary of GIC Real Estate Pte. Ltd., the real estate
    investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment
    Corporation, in which the Company retained an approximate 20%
    interest. During 2007, the Company contributed one approximately
    0.1 million square foot operating property for
    $4.6 million to this co-investment venture. In addition,
    the Company recognized development profits from the contribution
    to this co-investment venture of two completed development
    projects aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet
    with a contribution value of $22.9 million. During 2006,
    the Company recognized development profits of $5.1 million
    from the contribution of two completed development projects for
    $56.4 million aggregating approximately 0.8 million
    square feet.

On June 30, 2005, the Company formed AMB Japan Fund I,
    L.P., a co-investment venture with 13 institutional investors,
    in which the Company retained an approximate 20% interest. The
    13 institutional investors have committed 49.5 billion Yen
    (approximately $443.1 million in U.S. dollars, using
    the exchange rate at December 31, 2007) for an
    approximate 80% equity interest. During 2007, the Company
    contributed to this co-investment venture one completed
    development project for $84.4 million (using the exchange
    rate on the date of contribution) aggregating approximately
    0.5 million square feet. During 2006, the Company
    recognized development profits of $77.9 million,
    representing the portion of the Company’s interest in the
    contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for
    cash from the contribution to the co-investment venture of four
    completed development projects for $486.2 million (using
    the exchange rates in effect at contribution) aggregating
    approximately 2.6 million square feet.

On October 17, 2006, the Company formed AMB DFS
    Fund I, LLC, a merchant development co-investment venture
    with GE Real Estate (“GE”), in which the Company
    retained an approximate 15% interest. The co-investment venture
    has total investment capacity of approximately
    $500.0 million to pursue development-for-sale opportunities
    primarily in U.S. markets other than those the Company
    identifies as its target markets. GE and the Company have
    committed $425.0 million and $75.0 million of equity,
    respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    Company contributed to this co-investment venture approximately
    82 acres of land with a contribution value of approximately
    $30.3 million. During 2006, the Company contributed a land
    parcel with a contribution value of approximately
    $77.5 million to this fund and recognized development
    profits of approximately $0.8 million on the contribution,
    representing the portion of its interest in the contributed land
    parcel acquired by the third-party investor for cash.

Effective October 1, 2006, the Company deconsolidated AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended
    co-investment partnership formed in 2004 with institutional
    investors, on a prospective basis, due to the re-evaluation of
    the Company’s accounting for its investment in the fund
    because of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the
    general partner’s rights effective October 1, 2006.
    During 2007, the Company contributed to this co-investment
    venture one approximately 0.2 million square foot operating
    property and four completed development projects, aggregating
    approximately 1.0 million square feet for approximately
    $116.6 million. During 2006, the Company recognized
    development profits of $10.3 million, representing the
    portion of the Company’s interest in the contributed
    properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash from
    the contribution to the co-investment venture of three completed
    development projects for approximately $64.8 million
    aggregating approximately 0.6 million square feet.

On June 12, 2007, the Company formed AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, a Euro-denominated open-ended
    co-investment venture with institutional investors, in which the
    Company retained an approximate 20% interest. The

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

    2007 and 2006

institutional investors have committed approximately
    263.0 million Euros (approximately $383.7 million in
    U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31,
    2007) for an approximate 80% equity interest. During 2007,
    the Company contributed approximately 4.2 million square
    feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million
    square feet of completed development projects to this
    co-investment venture for approximately $799.3 million
    (using the exchange rates on the dates of contribution).

During 2007, the Company recognized gains from the contribution
    of real estate interests, net, of approximately
    $73.4 million, representing the portion of the
    Company’s interest in the contributed properties acquired
    by the third party investors for cash, as a result of the
    contribution of approximately 4.2 million square feet of
    operating properties to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, and two
    operating properties to AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. These gains are
    presented in gains from disposition of real estate interests in
    the consolidated statements of operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recognized development profits of approximately
    $95.7 million, as a result of the contribution of 15
    completed development projects and approximately 82 acres
    of land to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC,
    AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB DFS
    Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P.

Under the agreements governing the co-investment ventures, the
    Company and the other parties to the co-investment ventures may
    be required to make additional capital contributions and,
    subject to certain limitations, the co-investment ventures may
    incur additional debt.

On June 30, 2007, the Company exercised its option to
    purchase the remaining equity interest from an unrelated third
    party, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the
    co-investment venture agreement in AMB Pier One, LLC, for a
    nominal amount. AMB Pier One, LLC, is a co-investment venture
    related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier which holds the
    Company’s global headquarters in San Francisco,
    California. As a result, the investment was consolidated as of
    June 30, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company also had an
    approximate 39.0% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a
    Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides management and
    development services for industrial, retail, residential and
    office properties in Mexico. In addition, as of
    December 31, 2007, a subsidiary of the Company also had an
    approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund
    (“IAT”), a Canadian income trust specializing in
    aviation-related real estate at Canada’s leading
    international airports. This equity investment of approximately
    $2.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively, is
    included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as
    of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

    shares of its common stock for net proceeds of approximately
    $472.1 million, which were contributed to the Operating
    Partnership in exchange for the issuance of approximately
    8.4 million general partnership units. As a result of the
    common stock issuance, there was a significant reallocation of
    partnership interests due to the difference in the stock price
    at issuance as compared to the book value per share at the time
    of issuance. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the
    offering for general corporate purposes and, over the long term,
    to expand its global development business.

Stock Incentive Plans.

The Company has stock
    option and incentive plans (“Stock Incentive Plans”)
    for the purpose of attracting and retaining eligible officers,
    directors and employees. The Company has authorized for issuance
    17,500,000 shares of common stock under its 2002 stock
    incentive plan of which 9,443,727 shares were

remaining available for grant and 4,507,137 shares were
    reserved for issuance at December 31, 2007. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had 5,855,777 non-qualified
    options outstanding granted to certain directors, officers and
    employees which includes 1,348,640 shares of common stock
    reserved for issuance for outstanding option grants under its
    1997 stock incentive plan which expired in November 2007. Each
    option is exchangeable for one share of the Company’s
    common stock. Each option’s exercise price is equal to the
    Company’s market price on the date of grant. The options
    have an original ten-year term and generally vest pro rata in
    annual installments over a three to five-year period from the
    date of grant.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R,

Share Based
    Payment,

on January 1, 2006. The Company opted to
    utilize the modified prospective method of transition in
    adopting SFAS No. 123R. The effect of this change from
    applying the original expense recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

, had an immaterial effect on income before
    minority interests and discontinued operations, income from
    continuing operations, net income and earnings per share. The
    effect of this change from applying the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 had no effect on cash flow from operating
    and financing activities. The Company recorded a cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of
    $0.2 million as of January 1, 2006 to reflect the
    change in accounting for forfeitures. The Company values stock
    options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and
    recognizes this value as an expense over the vesting periods.
    Under this standard, recognition of expense for stock options is
    applied to all options granted after the beginning of the year
    of adoption. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, the
    Company will recognize the associated expense over the three to
    five-year vesting periods. Additionally, the Company awards
    restricted stock and recognizes this value as an expense over
    the vesting periods. As of December 31, 2007, the Company
    had $5.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested options granted under the Stock Incentive
    Plans which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
    period of 1 year. Results for prior periods have not been
    restated.

The following table summarizes stock option expense and
    restricted stock expense, included in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

SFAS No. 123R requires the cash flows resulting from
    tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the
    compensation cost recognized for those options (excess tax
    benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. The Company
    does not have any such excess tax benefits.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company uses historical
    data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within
    the valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on
    historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The risk-free
    rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based
    on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
    the grant.

    to 20% of their annual compensation (as adjusted under the terms
    of the 401(k) Plan), subject to certain limitations imposed by
    the Code. During the remainder of 2007, the percentage of
    compensation that may be

deferred was increased to 75%. During 2007 and 2006, the Company
    matched employee contributions under the 401(k) Plan in an
    amount equal to 50% of the first 6.0% of annual compensation
    deferred by each employee, up to a maximum match of $6,750 and
    $6,600 per year, respectively, for each participating employee.
    In the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company made matching contributions of $1.0 million,
    $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The
    Company may also make discretionary contributions to the 401(k)
    Plan. No discretionary contributions were made by the Company to
    the 401(k) Plan in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005.

The employees’ elective deferrals are immediately vested
    and non-forfeitable upon contribution to the 401(k) Plan.
    Matching contributions made by the Company vest fully one year
    after the commencement of an employee’s employment with the
    Company.

Deferred Compensation Plans.

The Company has
    established two non-qualified deferred compensation plans for
    eligible officers and directors of the Company and certain of
    its affiliates, which enable eligible participants to defer
    income from their U.S. payroll up to 100% of annual base
    pay, up to 100% of annual bonuses, up to 100% of their meeting
    fees

and/or

committee chairmanship fees, and up to 100% of certain
    equity-based compensation, as applicable, subject to
    restrictions, on a pre-tax basis. This deferred compensation is
    an unsecured obligation of the Company. The Company may make
    discretionary matching contributions to participant accounts at
    any time. The Company made no such discretionary matching
    contributions in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or
    2005. The participant’s elective deferrals and any matching
    contributions are immediately 100% vested. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the total fair value of
    compensation deferred was $100.9 million and
    $70.2 million, respectively.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Commitments

Lease Commitments.

The Company has entered
    into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily
    on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms
    of one to 55 years. Buildings and improvements subject to
    ground leases are depreciated ratably over the lesser of the
    terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum
    rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases
    in effect as of December 31, 2007 were as follows (dollars
    in thousands):

Standby Letters of Credit.

As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had provided approximately
    $24.2 million in letters of credit, of which
    $16.8 million was provided under the Operating
    Partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit
    facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under
    certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other
    commitments.

Guarantees and Contribution
    Obligations.

Excluding parent guarantees
    associated with unsecured debt or contribution obligations as
    discussed in Notes 5 and 9, the Company had outstanding
    guarantees and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount
    of $405.2 million as described below.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding
    guarantees in the amount of $95.9 million in connection
    with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2007, the
    Company also guaranteed $41.2 million and
    $107.9 million on outstanding loans on five of its
    consolidated co-investment ventures and two of its
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures, respectively.

Also, the Company has entered into contribution agreements with
    its unconsolidated co-investment venture funds. These
    contribution agreements require the Company to make additional
    capital contributions to the applicable co-investment venture
    fund upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of
    certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional
    capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than the Company’s share of the co-investment
    venture’s debt obligation or the value of its share of any
    property securing such debt. The Company’s contribution
    obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the
    amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the
    property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the
    lender upon default. The Company’s potential obligations
    under these contribution agreements are $160.2 million as
    of December 31, 2007.

Performance and Surety Bonds.

As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding performance
    and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $15.2 million.
    These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its
    development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax
    obligations and the construction of certain real property
    improvements and infrastructure. The performance and surety
    bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due
    or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure.

Promoted Interests and Other Contractual
    Obligations.

Upon the achievement of certain
    return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, the
    Company may be obligated to make payments to certain of its
    co-investment venture partners pursuant to the terms and
    provisions of their contractual agreements with the Operating

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Partnership. From time to time in the normal course of the
    Company’s business, the Company enters into various
    contracts with third parties that may obligate it to make
    payments, pay promotes or perform other obligations upon the
    occurrence of certain events.

Contingencies

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Company may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a
    material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters.

The Company monitors
    its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic
    substances. The Company is not aware of any environmental
    liability with respect to the properties that would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business, assets
    or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance
    that such a material environmental liability does not exist. The
    existence of any such material environmental liability would
    have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations and cash flow. The Company carries environmental
    insurance and believes that the policy terms, conditions, limits
    and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the
    circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the cost of such
    coverage and current industry practice.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Company carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood and terrorism
    insurance. The Company believes that the policy terms,
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and current industry practice. In
    addition, a significant number of the Company’s properties
    are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. As
    a result, the Company has obtained limited earthquake insurance
    on those properties. There are, however, certain types of
    extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war, that may
    be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although
    the Company has obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism,
    with policy specifications and insured limits that it believes
    are commercially reasonable, there can be no assurance that the
    Company will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Company could lose its investment in,
    and anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property.

Captive Insurance Company.

The Company has a
    wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata National
    Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for
    all or a portion of losses below the deductible under the
    Company’s third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of the Company’s overall risk
    management program. The Company capitalized Arcata in accordance
    with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata establishes
    annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss
    experience at the Company’s properties. Annually, the
    Company engages an independent third party to perform an
    actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related
    deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated
    risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be
    adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to
    third-party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be
    reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms.
    Through this structure, the Company believes that it has more
    comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than
    would otherwise be available in the market.

Segment
    Information

The segment information for the prior periods has been
    reclassified to conform to current presentation.

The Company has two lines of business, real estate operations
    and private capital. Real estate operations is comprised of
    various segments while private capital consists of a single
    segment, on which the Company evaluates its performance:

•

Real Estate Operations.

The Company operates
    industrial properties and manages its business by geographic
    markets. Such industrial properties typically comprise multiple
    distribution warehouse facilities suitable for single or
    multiple customers who are engaged in various types of
    businesses. The geographic markets where the Company owns
    industrial properties are managed separately because it believes
    each market has its own economic characteristics and requires
    its own operating, pricing and leasing strategies. Each market
    is considered to be an individual operating segment. The
    accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The
    Company evaluates performance based upon property net operating
    income of the combined properties in each segment, which are
    listed below. In addition, the Company’s development
    business is included under real estate operations. It primarily
    consists of the Company’s development of real estate
    properties that are subsequently contributed to a co-investment
    venture fund in which the Company has an ownership interest and
    for which the Company acts as manager, or that are sold to third
    parties. The Company evaluates performance of the development
    business by reported operating segment based upon gains
    generated from the disposition

and/or

contribution of real estate. The assets of the development
    business generally include properties under development and land
    held for development. During the period between the completion
    of development of a property and the date the property is
    contributed to an unconsolidated co-investment venture or sold
    to a third party, the property and its associated rental income
    and property operating costs are included in the real estate
    operations segment because the primary activity associated with
    the property during that period is leasing. Upon contribution or
    sale, the resulting gain or loss is included as gains from
    dispositions of real estate interests or development profits, as
    appropriate.

•

Private Capital.

The Company, through its
    private capital group, AMB Capital Partners, LLC, provides real
    estate investment, portfolio management and reporting services
    to co-investment ventures and clients. The private capital
    income earned consists of acquisition and development fees,
    asset management fees and priority distributions, and promoted
    interests and incentive distributions from the Company’s
    co-investment ventures and AMB Capital Partners’ clients.
    With respect to the Company’s U.S. and Mexico funds
    and co-investment ventures, the Company typically earns a
    90 basis points acquisition fee on the acquisition cost of
    third party acquisitions, asset management priority
    distributions of 7.5% of net operating income on stabilized
    properties, 70 basis points of total projected costs as
    asset management fees on renovation or development properties,
    and incentive distributions of 15% of the return over a 9%
    internal rate of return and 20% of the return over a 12%
    internal rate of return to investors on a periodic basis or at
    the end of a fund’s life. In Japan, the Company earns a
    90 basis points acquisition fee on the acquisition cost of
    third party acquisitions, asset management priority
    distributions of 1.5% of 80% of the committed equity during the
    investment period and then 1.5% of unreturned equity, and
    incentive distributions of 20% of the return over a 10% internal
    rate of return and 25% of the return over a 13% internal rate of
    return to investors at the end of a fund’s life. In Europe,
    the Company earns a 90 basis points acquisition fee on the
    acquisition cost of third party acquisitions, asset management
    fees of 75 basis points on the gross asset value of the
    fund, and incentive distributions of 20% of the return over a 9%
    internal rate of return and 25% of the return over a 12%
    internal rate of return to investors on a periodic basis. The
    accounting policies of the segment are the same as those
    described in the summary of significant accounting policies
    under Note 2, Interim Financial Statements. The Company
    evaluates performance based upon private capital income.

The markets included in U.S. markets are a subset of the
    Company’s regions defined as East, Southwest and West
    Central in the Americas. Japan is a subset of our Asia region.

(2)

Property net operating income (“NOI”) is defined as
    rental revenue, including reimbursements, less property
    operating expenses, which excludes depreciation, amortization,
    general and administrative expenses and interest expense. For a
    reconciliation of NOI to net income, see the table below.

The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate and useful
    supplemental performance measure because NOI reflects the
    operating performance of the Company’s real estate
    portfolio on a segment basis, and the Company uses NOI to make
    decisions about resource allocations and to assess regional
    property level performance. However, NOI should not be viewed as
    an alternative measure of the Company’s financial
    performance since it does not reflect general and administrative
    expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs,
    capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development
    and construction activities that could materially impact the
    Company’s results from operations. Further, the
    Company’s NOI may not be comparable to that of other real
    estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for
    calculating NOI.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Unitholders of

AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of net
    assets, operations, changes in net assets and cash flows,
    present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2007, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for the period from May 31, 2007 to
    December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in Luxembourg. These financial statements are
    the responsibility of the Board of Managers of AMB
    Fund Management S.à r.1. (the “Management
    Company”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
    these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
    audit of these statements in accordance with the standards of
    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
    obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

    “Unitholders”) by AMB Fund Management, S.à
    r.l. a Luxembourg private limited company (the “Management
    Company”), pursuant to the Management Regulations of the
    Fund, as the same may be modified or supplemented (“the
    Management Regulations”).

    Also at Inception, AMB European Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Europe”) was admitted to the Fund as a Unitholder in
    exchange for the indirect contribution of 38 industrial
    buildings. At Inception, total equity committed to the Fund by
    all Unitholders, including AMB Europe, was
    €315.1 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund
    had received capital contributions of approximately
    €284.3 million in exchange for 283,675 Units in the
    Fund. Profits and distributions of the Fund are allocated to
    Unitholders as provided in the Management Regulations. AMB
    Europe owned an approximate 21.4 percent interest in the
    Fund as of December 31, 2007.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation.

The consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    Luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements (“Lux
    GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements
    include the financial position and results of operations of the
    Fund and the joint ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s joint
    ventures are reflected as minority interests in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated. All monetary figures are expressed
    in Euro.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with Lux GAAP requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Valuation of Real Estate Investments.

Real
    estate investments not publicly traded are carried at their
    estimated fair value in accordance with Luxembourg legal and
    regulatory requirements for investment funds.

The fair value of real estate investments held by the Fund are
    determined in accordance with the Fund’s appraisal policy
    as approved by the Management Company and the three member
    Independent Council for the Fund (the “Appraisal
    Policy”). Under the Appraisal Policy, approximately one
    fourth of the Fund’s properties are valued by the
    Fund’s independent appraiser (the “Independent
    Appraiser”) each quarter, such that all properties are
    valued at least annually. With respect to all properties
    acquired by the Fund, the Management Company will determine the
    quarter during which each such property will first be appraised,
    provided that it is appraised within the first five calendar
    quarters beginning after the acquisition of such property by the
    Fund.

Appraisals are conducted by the Independent Appraiser in
    accordance with valuation principles set forth in the Appraisal
    and Valuation Manual as published by the Royal Institute of
    Chartered Surveyors or such other standards as may be proposed
    by the Management Company and approved by the Independent
    Council.

Recently acquired investments are accounted for and carried at
    cost, including costs of acquisition plus capital expenditures
    subsequent to acquisition, as this is the best estimate of fair
    value.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2007

Once a property has been appraised, the value of the property is
    the net value of the property shown in the appraisal, adjusted
    (if appropriate) to take into account unamortized closing costs
    and transfer tax savings, if any, resulting from the structure
    of the acquisition of the property, plus capital expenditures
    subsequent to the appraisal not otherwise taken into account in
    the appraisal. Closing costs are costs incurred in connection
    with the acquisition of a property indirectly through a share
    transaction or directly through an asset deal. Transfer tax
    savings result in certain cases depending on the structure of
    the acquisition transaction, and are assumed to generally be
    split between a buyer and a seller of real estate, of the
    estimated transfer taxes on a fifty-fifty basis. The property
    values are reviewed and approved by the Management Company and
    the Independent Council.

Ultimate realisation of the fair values is dependent to a great
    extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond
    management’s control (such as general economic conditions,
    conditions affecting tenants and other events occurring in the
    markets in which individual properties are located). Further,
    values may or may not represent the prices at which the real
    estate investments would be sold since market prices of real
    estate investments can only be determined by negotiation between
    a willing buyer and seller.

Unrealised gains and losses are determined by comparing the fair
    value of the real estate investments to the total acquisition
    cost plus capital expenditures of such assets and are shown net
    of deferred tax liabilities. Unrealised gains and losses
    relating to changes in fair value of the Fund’s real estate
    investments are reflected in the consolidated statement of
    operations as a component of unrealised gains and losses on
    investments in real estate.

Real Estate Transactions.

Purchases of real
    estate investments are recorded at purchase price when title to
    the real estate has been transferred to the Fund. Deal costs in
    relation to pre-acquisition such as legal and other professional
    fees, appraisals and other direct expenses incurred for
    prospective acquisitions of properties are capitalised and
    included within the cost of the corresponding investment upon
    acquisition. In the event that the deal is abandoned, the costs
    are then charged to the consolidated statement of operations.

Capital Expenditures.

Expenditures which
    extend the economic life of the asset, or which represent
    additional capital improvements providing benefit in future
    periods (including tenant improvements) are capitalised together
    with the cost of investments purchased.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

All cash on hand,
    demand deposits with financial institutions and short term,
    highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow by notaries or in connection with reserves from
    loan proceeds for certain capital improvements and real estate
    tax payments.

Fund Formation Costs.

The formation costs
    of the Fund are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
    basis over a five-year period starting at Inception.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs resulting from
    debt issues are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
    basis over the period of the corresponding debt.

Deferred Tax Asset.

Deferred tax assets are
    included in the consolidated statement of net assets when it is
    probable that future taxable income will be recognised in the
    foreseeable future.

Taxation in Luxembourg.

The Fund is liable for
    a subscription tax of 0.01 percent per annum computed, and
    proportionately paid on its net assets value at the end of each
    quarter.

Luxembourg subsidiaries of the Fund are fully subject to
    Luxembourg taxes on income and net worth, however exemptions are
    available. Dividend payments to the Fund from the Luxembourg
    subsidiaries, if any, are subject to a withholding tax of
    15.0 percent. The tax implications have been discussed and
    agreed with the Luxembourg Tax Authorities and confirmed in an
    Advance Tax Agreement.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2007

Taxation abroad.

Provisions for taxation are
    made for income earned by the Fund’s subsidiaries abroad on
    the basis of laws and regulations relating to taxation in the
    countries where the relevant net income is earned.

Deferred Tax Liability.

The deferred tax
    liability as of December 31, 2007 is related to built-in
    unrealised gain on the properties. The unrealised taxable gains
    are valued at the statutory tax rate for capital gains in the
    jurisdiction in which the property is located and reduced by
    50.0 percent to represent a customary buyer and seller
    split of proceeds on potential future dispositions.

Debt.

Debt consists of external secured debt
    stated at face value, adjusted for unrealised gains or losses
    reflecting the change in the fair market value of the debt.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent interests held by affiliates of AMB and third-party
    investors in various entities of the Fund. The Fund consolidates
    these investments because the Fund owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Unitholders’ Capital.

Profits and losses
    of the Fund are allocated to each of the Unitholders in
    accordance with the Management Regulations. Distributions to
    Unitholders are typically made quarterly. Distributions, other
    than incentive distributions (Note 14), are paid or accrued
    to each of the Unitholders in accordance with their respective
    units owned at the time distributions are declared.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

The Fund may
    acquire derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to
    interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate loans. These
    financial instruments are recorded at fair value with any
    unrealised and realised gains or losses included in the
    consolidated statement of operations.

Rental Revenue and Income Recognition.

The
    Fund, as a lessor, retains substantially all of the benefits and
    risks of ownership of the Properties and accounts for its leases
    as operating leases. Rental income as well as rent incentives
    are recognised on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
    leases until the first break right, if any, in the lease.
    Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other
    recoverable operating expenses are recognised as revenue in the
    period that the applicable expenses are incurred. Interest
    income is recorded on an accrual basis. Interest received is
    stated net of withholding taxes. In addition, the Fund includes
    bad debt expense in property operating costs.

Foreign currency translation.

Transactions on
    foreign currencies have been translated into Euros at the rates
    of exchange prevailing at the dates of those transactions.

AMB Property L.P. (“AMB L.P.”) obtains various types
    of liability and property insurance for the benefit of the Fund.
    The insurance coverage includes Commercial General Liability
    Insurance, Umbrella Liability and Excess Liability Insurance and
    Broad Form All Risk Property Damage and Business
    Interruption Insurance, which include earthquake, flood,
    terrorism, and boiler and machinery. The Property Damage and
    Business Interruption Insurance provides for a $150,000,000 each
    occurrence limit of liability subject to industry standard per
    occurrence and aggregate policy sub-limits, deductibles,
    definitions, exclusions and limitations. Property damage is
    valued on a replacement cost basis. Using this method for
    valuing loss, damages for a claim equal amount needed to replace
    the property using new materials without a reduction for
    depreciation.

AMB L.P. regularly evaluates the types and amounts of coverage
    that it carries, and to assess whether in AMB L.P.’s good
    faith discretion, the coverage and limits carried are
    appropriate for the Fund.

Debt

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had a
    €428.0 million credit facility with ING Bank N.V.
    (“Facility 1”), which provides that certain of the
    Fund’s affiliates may borrow either acquisition loans, up
    to a €100.0 million sub-limit (the “Acquisition
    Loan Facility”), or secured term loans, in connection with
    properties located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,
    the United Kingdom, Italy, or Spain. Loan draws under Facility 1
    bear interest at a rate of 65 basis points over EURIBOR and
    may occur until its maturity on April 30, 2014. Drawings
    under the Acquisition Loan Facility bear interest at a rate of
    75 basis points over EURIBOR and are repayable within six
    months of the date of advance, unless extended. The Fund
    guarantees the Acquisition Loan Facility and is a carve-out
    indemnitor with respect to the secured term loans. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Fund had €295.9 million in
    outstanding term loans under Facility 1, including
    €24.7 million outstanding under the Acquisition Loan
    Facility. Facility 1 contains customary and other affirmative
    covenants and negative covenants, including financial reporting
    requirements and maintenance of specific ratios. The Management
    Company of the Fund believes that it was in compliance with
    these financial covenants as of December 31, 2007.

On August 9, 2007, the Fund executed with Aareal Bank A.G.
    a €275.0 million facility (“Facility 2”),
    which provides that certain of the Fund’s affiliates may
    borrow secured term loans in connection with properties located
    in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United
    Kingdom, Italy or Spain. Drawings under Facility 2 may
    occur until its maturity on November 28, 2014, and those
    made in the first year are expected to bear interest at a rate
    of 75 basis points over EURIBOR. The Fund is a carve-out
    indemnitor in respect to the secured term loans. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Fund had €133.0 million in
    outstanding term loans under Facility 2. Facility 2 contains
    customary and other affirmative covenants and negative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specific ratios.

In addition to both facilities, the Fund had two mortgage loans
    outstanding, as of December 31, 2007 totaling
    €28.3 million, which mature between 2008 and 2017.
    These loans are held with IKB Bank A.G. and Credit Fonciere de
    France for €13.9 million and €14.4 million,
    respectively. These mortgage loans, together with the loans
    outstanding under both facilities, bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.1 percent.

Fund Net
    Asset Value

The net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund is determined
    based on the values of the properties (determined in accordance
    with the Appraisal Policy), and takes into account, among other
    things, the value of the Fund’s cash and short-term
    investments, an intangible asset valued based on the formation
    costs of the Fund, the carrying value of all other assets of the
    Fund, and the liabilities of the Fund, including an adjustment
    to reflect the cost or value on any above- or below- market
    indebtedness of the Fund, a ratable portion of the present value
    of the projected incentive distribution, and a provision for
    deferred tax liabilities relating to the acquisition of
    properties as determined in accordance with the Appraisal
    Policy. The Fund’s NAV is determined by the Investment
    Advisor (as defined in Note 14) and is reviewed and

    Management Regulations) as of the end of each calendar quarter.
    The Fund incurred Management Fees of approximately
    €3.0 million for the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2007

Also under the Management Regulations, the Management Company is
    entitled to receive an acquisition fee (the “Acquisition
    Fee”) in an amount equal to 0.9 percent of the
    acquisition cost of properties acquired by the Fund for
    identifying, analyzing, recommending and closing the purchase of
    properties acquired directly or indirectly by the Fund from a
    third party. Acquisition Fees are capitalised and included in
    investments in real estate in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of net assets. During the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007, the Fund capitalised approximately
    €1.3 million in acquisition fees.

Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement (the
    “Advisory Agreement”), the Management Company has
    retained AMB Property Europe B.V. (the “Investment
    Advisor”) to provide operations and asset management
    services and acquisition advisory services to the Fund and its
    subsidiaries and fund advisory services to the Management
    Company. To the extent services are provided directly to the
    subsidiaries of the Fund, the Investment Advisor or its
    affiliated delegates providing such services may charge fees,
    without duplication, directly to the subsidiaries to which the
    services are provided.

At certain properties, affiliates of AMB L.P. are responsible
    for the property management or the accounting or both. On a
    quarterly basis, AMB L.P. earns property management fees between
    0.1 percent and 2.8 percent of the respective
    property’s base rent. For the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007, AMB L.P. earned property management fees
    of approximately €0.3 million.

At certain properties, AMB L.P. earns a leasing commission when
    it has acted as the listing broker or the procuring broker or
    both. During the period from Incorporation to December 31,
    2007, AMB L.P. earned no leasing commissions.

Commencing June 30, 2010 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB Europe is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    20.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 25.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2007, no incentive distribution has been paid to AMB Europe. The
    Fund accrued approximately €0.9 million in incentive
    distributions to AMB Europe for the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007.

AMB L.P. has a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. (“Arcata”), which provides
    insurance coverage for a portion of losses under our third-party
    policies. AMB L.P. capitalised Arcata in accordance with the
    applicable regulatory requirements. Annually, AMB L.P. engages
    an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of
    future projected claims, related deductibles and projected
    expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB L.P. based on AMB L.P.’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated
    to the Properties was approximately €0.3 million for
    the period from Incorporation to December 31, 2007.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows AMB
    L.P.’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on The Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can

S-23


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2007

be no assurance that such a material environmental liability
    does not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. The Fund believes that the policy terms and
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and industry practice. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts
    of war that may be either uninsurable or not economically
    insurable. Although the Fund has obtained coverage for certain
    acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits
    that the Fund believes are commercially reasonable, it is not
    certain that the Fund will be able to collect under such
    policies. Should an uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose
    its investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from,
    a property. AMB Europe has adopted certain policies with respect
    to insurance coverage and proceeds as part of its operating
    policies, which apply to properties owned or managed by AMB
    Europe, including properties owned by the Fund.

17.

Differences
    from United States Accounting Principles

Luxembourg GAAP varies in certain significant respects from the
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“US GAAP”). The approximate effect of these principal
    differences on the Fund’s Audited Consolidated Statement of
    Net Assets and Audited Consolidated Statement of Operations are
    quantified below and described in the accompanying notes.

A. The differences between US GAAP and Luxembourg GAAP
    are summarised as follows:

Under US GAAP:

•

Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at
    cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be
    recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is
    reduced to estimated fair value. At acquisition an intangible
    asset or liability for the value attributable to above or
    below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs
    for all acquisitions is recorded. Carrying values for financial
    reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period
    in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property
    is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property
    over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings.

•

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are owned by federal, state
    or local port authorities, and subject to ground leases are
    depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual
    term of the underlying ground lease. Depreciation of tenant
    improvements is recorded of the remaining lease term.
    Amortisation of above and below-market leases is recorded in
    rental revenues over the average remaining lease term. In-place
    leases are amortised over the average remaining lease term.

•

Debt premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt
    over the principal value of debt assumed in connection with the
    Fund’s formation and subsequent property acquisitions. The
    debt premiums are being amortised as an offset to interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest
    method. Costs incurred related to

start-up

activities, including organizational costs, are expensed as
    incurred. Costs incurred relating to raising capital are
    recorded as an offset to Unitholderss Capital. Financial
    instruments are recorded in accordance with

S-24


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2007

SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and for Hedging Activities. This standard provides comprehensive
    guidelines for the recognition and measurement of derivatives
    and hedging activities and, specifically, requires all
    derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as
    an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss.

•

Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets can be recorded as
    an offset to deferred tax assets. The Fund is not subject to tax
    and therefore does not record deferred tax liability related to
    the ultimate sale of assets.

Under Luxembourg GAAP:

•

All real estate investments, including debt investments and
    derivatives, are revalued to fair market value and the premium
    generated from the acquisition of entities at a price below fair
    market value of acquired assets and liabilities is recognised as
    an unrealised gain.

•

Organizational costs and other fund formation costs are
    capitalized and amortised on a straight-line basis over a
    5 year period.

•

Deferred tax liabilities are recorded on unrealized taxable
    gains at the statutory tax rate for capital gains in the
    property’s jurisdiction and reduced by 50% to represent a
    customary buyer and seller split of proceeds on potential future
    dispositions.

•

Additional differences under Luxembourg GAAP are discussed in
    Note 2.

    79.4 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively.

On February 15, 2008, the Fund acquired one industrial
    building totaling 10,285 square meters (unaudited), for a
    total purchase price of
    approximately €17.7 million. In conjunction with
    this acquisition, AMB Europe received
    approximately €0.6 million in Units.

Organization

On May 19, 2005, AMB Japan Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Japan”) and AMB Property II, L.P. as limited partner,
    formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the “Fund”), a
    Cayman Islands-exempted limited partnership. On June 30,
    2005 (“Inception”), 13 institutional investors were
    admitted as limited partners to the Fund and AMB Property II,
    L.P. withdrew as a limited partner.

The limited partners have collectively committed ¥
    49.5 billion in equity to the Fund and AMB Japan, as
    general partner, has committed ¥ 0.5 billion in equity
    to the Fund. In addition, AMB Property Singapore Pte. Ltd.
    (“AMB Singapore”) has committed ¥
    11.9 billion in equity to co-invest with the Fund in
    properties. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had completed
    five capital calls totaling ¥ 26.8 billion and ¥
    0.3 billion from the limited partners and general partner,
    respectively, of which non-cash contributions from the general
    partner totaled ¥ 0.2 billion.

The Fund and AMB Singapore co-invest (80.81 percent and
    19.19 percent, respectively) in Singapore private limited
    companies (“PTEs”) which indirectly own industrial
    real estate in Japan. The properties are owned individually in
    Japanese Tokutei Mokuteki Kaishas (“TMKs”). TMKs are
    asset-backed entities subject to tax on income net of
    distributions. Distributions from TMKs to non-residents are
    subject to local withholding taxes.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund indirectly owned
    80.81 percent of 24 operating buildings (the
    “Properties”) aggregating approximately
    5.4 million square feet. The Properties are located in the
    Fukuoka market and in the following submarkets of Tokyo: Chiba,
    Funabashi, Kashiwa, Kawasaki, Narita, Narashino, Ohta, and
    Saitama, and the Amagasaki submarket of Osaka.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“U.S. GAAP”) in Yen currency. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the
    Fund and the joint ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s joint
    ventures are reflected as minority interests in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Functional and Reporting Currency.

The Yen is
    both the functional and reporting currency for the Fund’s
    operations. Functional currency is the currency of the primary
    economic environment in which the Fund operates. Monetary assets
    and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Yen are
    remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economic and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of

AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2007

(Report not required)

the Fund’s long-lived assets could occur in the future
    period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a
    property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the
    property over its estimated fair value is charged to income and
    is included in the consolidated statements of operations. The
    management of the Fund believes that there were no impairments
    of the carrying values of its investments in real estate as of
    December 31, 2007.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    investments in real estate. The estimated lives are as follows:

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Estimated Lives

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in the property
    including legal fees and acquisition costs.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

The Fund records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Fund has recorded intangible assets
    and liabilities in the amounts of ¥ 553.4 million,
    ¥ 1.2 billion, and ¥ 137.1 million for the
    value attributable to below-market leases, in-place leases, and
    lease origination costs, respectively, which are included in
    buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    reserves required to be held pursuant to agreements with Chuo
    Mitsui Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., JP Morgan
    Trust Bank, Ltd. (“JP Morgan”), Sumitomo Mitsui
    Banking Corporation and Shinsei Bank, Limited, as well as cash
    held in escrow under the terms of the loan agreement with JP
    Morgan. Pursuant to these agreements, minimum levels of cash are
    required to be held as reserves for operating expenses, real
    estate taxes and insurance reserves, security deposits,
    consumption tax and maintenance reserves. Restricted cash also
    includes cash held directly by the Fund as collateral for a
    ¥ 2.2 billion of secured loan payable in connection
    with the Fund’s acquisition of AMB Funabashi Distribution
    Center 6. Upon repayment of the secured loan payable, the cash
    will be released. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
    ¥ 2.6 billion of restricted cash, which was held
    directly by the Fund as collateral, was released upon full
    repayment of the ¥ 2.6 billion secured loan payable in
    connection with the Fund’s acquisition of Higashi-Ogijima
    Distribution Center in 2005.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related debt. As of December 31, 2007,
    deferred financing costs were ¥ 458.8 million, net of
    accumulated amortization.

Financial Instruments.

Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging Activities, provides
    comprehensive guidelines for the recognition and measurement of
    derivatives and hedging activities and, specifically, requires
    all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
    value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated
    other comprehensive income or loss.

    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2007

(Report not required)

The Fund’s derivative financial instruments in effect at
    December 31, 2007 were five interest rate swaps, hedging
    cash flows of the Fund’s variable rate bonds based on Tokyo
    Inter-bank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”) and London
    Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin.
    Adjustments to the fair value of these instruments for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 resulted in a loss of ¥
    406.1 million, net of minority interests. There were no
    other derivative financial instruments included in accumulated
    other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31,
    2007. This loss is included in accounts payable and other
    liabilities and other comprehensive loss in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of partners’ capital.

Mortgage and Bond Premiums.

Mortgage and bond
    premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt over the
    principal value of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions.
    The mortgage and bond premiums are being amortized into interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2007, the
    unamortized mortgage and bond premiums were approximately
    ¥ 43.9 million.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent a 19.19 percent indirect equity interest in the
    Properties held by AMB Singapore. Such investments are
    consolidated because the Fund owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Fund are allocated to each of the partners in accordance
    with the Fund’s partnership agreement. Partner
    distributions are expected to be made on a semi-annual basis
    when distributable proceeds are available. Distributions, other
    than priority distributions (Note 8), are made to each of
    the partners in accordance with their respective ownership
    interests at the time of the distribution.

Rental Revenues.

The Fund, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. The Fund recorded ¥ 95.7 million of
    revenue related to the amortization of lease intangibles for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. The lease intangibles are
    being amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Fund in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Fund’s ability to lease space and on
    the level of rent that can be achieved. The Fund had five
    tenants that accounted for 47.7 percent of rental revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Fund’s financial instruments include a mortgage loan
    payable, bonds payable and secured loans payable. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Fund at December 31, 2007,
    the estimated fair market value of the financial instruments was
    ¥ 74.4 billion.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In July 2006,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), which
    clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
    positions, as defined. FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity
    in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition
    and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. Adoption
    of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not have a material
    effect on the Fund.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The Fund does not believe that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact
    on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

, which permits entities to choose to measure
    many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
    that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. This Statement is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal year beginning after
    November 15, 2007. The Fund does not believe that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact
    on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Real
    Estate Acquisition Activity

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund acquired
    11 buildings totaling 1,105,800 square feet. The total
    aggregate investment was approximately ¥ 22.0 billion,
    which includes approximately ¥ 660.9 million in
    closing costs and acquisition fees related to these acquisitions.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund acquired
    an 80.81 percent equity interest in an entity that
    indirectly owned an operating property aggregating
    469,627 square feet from AMB Japan. AMB Singapore retained
    19.19 percent of the equity interest in the same entity.
    The total aggregate investment cost was approximately ¥
    9.7 billion which includes ¥ 19.5 million in
    closing costs. As of December 31, 2007, AMB Japan owed the
    Fund ¥ 29.7 million, which represents the overpaid
    portion of the purchase price, and is included in net payables
    to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The total purchase price, excluding closing costs and
    acquisition fees has been allocated as follows:

Debt

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had one mortgage loan
    payable totaling ¥ 2.7 billion, not including an
    unamortized mortgage premium of approximately ¥
    19.5 million. The mortgage loan payable bears interest at a
    fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures in 2011.

The mortgage loan payable is collateralized by certain of the
    Properties and requires interest only payments to be made
    quarterly until maturity in 2011. In addition, the mortgage loan
    payable has various covenants. Management of the Fund believes
    that the Fund was in compliance with these covenants as of
    December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had one collateralized
    bond payable totaling ¥ 3.3 billion, not including an
    unamortized bond premium of ¥ 24.4 million. The bond
    bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures
    in 2011. Principal amortization on this bond started in June
    2007.

If at any such time the principal outstanding on the ¥
    3.3 billion bond payable reaches the balance of the
    principal outstanding on the ¥ 2.7 billion mortgage
    loan payable, amortization of principal would then be applied on
    a pro rata basis of 50.0 percent to the bond payable and
    50.0 percent to the mortgage loan payable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2007

(Report not required)

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had five collateralized
    specified bonds payable totaling ¥ 41.2 billion. The
    bonds bear interest at rates per annum equal to the rates of the
    TIBOR and Yen LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to
    155 basis points and mature between 2012 and 2013. To hedge
    the cash flows of these floating rate borrowings, the Fund
    purchased interest swaps, which have fixed the interest rates
    payable on principal amounts totaling ¥ 36.6 billion
    as of December 31, 2007, at rates ranging from
    1.32 percent to 1.60 percent per annum excluding the
    margin. Including the interest rate swaps, the effective
    borrowing costs for the ¥ 41.2 billion bonds as of
    December 31, 2007 is 2.54 percent per annum.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had secured loans payable
    totaling ¥ 27.3 billion:

(i) Of the ¥ 27.3 billion secured loans payable,
    ¥ 15.5 billion bears interest at a rate per annum
    equal to TIBOR plus a margin ranging from 20 to 95 basis
    points. ¥ 13.3 billion matures in June 2008 and ¥
    2.2 billion matures in February 2008. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the interest rate approximated
    0.74 percent per annum. ¥ 2.2 billion of the
    loans payable is secured by the restricted cash balances held
    directly by the Fund in a cash collateral account. ¥
    13.3 billion of the loans payable is secured by a first
    priority security interest in, and to all of certain TMKs’
    right, title and interest in and to nine buildings, and
    severally but not jointly guaranteed by the Fund and AMB
    Singapore, the indirect owners of the TMKs.

(ii) Of the ¥ 27.3 billion secured loans payable,
    ¥ 11.8 billion bears interest at a rate per annum
    equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 75 basis points and matures
    in April 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    interest rate approximated 1.31 percent per annum. The loan
    payable is secured by the partners’ capital commitments.

Transactions
    With Affiliates

During the year ended December 31, 2007, AMB Japan
    contributed its equity interest in one Singapore PTE entity,
    which owned a 80.81 percent indirect interest in one
    operating property, aggregating 0.5 million square feet, to
    the Fund. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had an
    obligation of ¥ 86.0 million, payable to AMB Japan,
    related to the unpaid portion of the contribution value for the
    Singapore PTE entities, which is included in net payables to
    affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
    Agreement and the Co-Investment Agreement, AMB Japan receives an
    acquisition fee equal to 0.9 percent of the Fund’s
    share of the acquisition cost of properties purchased from third
    parties. This acquisition fee is reduced by a 0.4 percent
    acquisition fee AMB Singapore receives of the acquisition cost
    of properties purchased from third parties who are referred to
    the Fund by AMB Singapore. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Fund incurred acquisition fees of
    approximately ¥157.0 million, of which
    ¥87.2 million was paid to AMB Japan and
    ¥69.8 million was paid to AMB Singapore related to the
    Fund’s acquisition of AMB Funabashi Distribution Center
    6-9, AMB Fukuoka Distribution Center 1, AMB Chiba Distribution
    Center 1, AMB Higashi-Ogijima Distribution Center 2, AMB
    Narashino Distribution Center 1 and AMB Saitama Distribution
    Center 4 and 5. As of December 31, 2007,
    ¥2.3 million was payable to AMB Japan and
    ¥1.9 million was payable to AMB Singapore related to
    the Fund’s acquisition of AMB Saitama Distribution
    Center 4, which are included in net payables to affiliates
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The acquisition fee paid to AMB Blackpine Ltd (a former joint
    venture company which was subsequently fully acquired by
    AMB’s wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary during the year
    ended December 31, 2006) in relation to the
    acquisition of Higashi-Ogijima Distribution Center in 2005 was
    capitalized and included in investments in real estate in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31,
    2007, the unamortized acquisition fee was approximately
    ¥59.7 million.

Pursuant to an asset management fees agreement, on
    January 1, 2006, AMB Property Japan began providing asset
    management services to the Properties. The asset management fee
    is payable monthly. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Fund recorded asset management fees of approximately
    ¥146.1 million.

Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, AMB Singapore
    receives management service fees, payable on a quarterly basis,
    equal to 0.25 percent of capital (equity and shareholder
    loans) contributed to each PTE by the Fund and AMB Singapore.
    For the year ended December 31, 2007, the PTEs recorded
    management service fees of approximately ¥
    49.3 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund owed
    ¥ 44.5 million, for management service fees, which are
    included in net payables to affiliates in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated
    Limited Partnership Agreement of Limited Partnership, for the
    period from July 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007, the
    asset management priority distribution base changed from
    100.0 percent to 90.0 percent of the aggregate capital
    commitments to the Fund; and for the period from April 1,
    2007 through the Supplemental Capital Call Date, the asset
    management priority distribution base changed from
    90.0 percent to 80.0 percent of the aggregate capital
    commitments to the Fund until the earlier of 80.0 percent
    of capital commitments being called or the Supplemental Capital
    Call Date. Subsequently, AMB Japan receives asset management
    priority distributions equal to 1.5 percent per annum,
    payable on a quarterly basis, of the unreturned capital
    contributions. The amounts referred to above are reduced by
    amounts paid or accrued to AMB Singapore for management service
    fees pursuant to the Management Services Agreement and asset
    management fees paid or accrued to AMB Property Japan, pursuant
    to the Agreement Regarding Asset Management Fees.

Promptly following the Supplemental Capital Call Date, an asset
    management priority distribution recalculation will be performed
    as follows:

(i) For the period from July 1, 2006 through
    March 31, 2007 (the “First Calculation Period”),
    the asset management priority distribution will be recalculated
    based on the greater of 90.0 percent of the aggregate
    capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent of the
    unreturned capital contributions. If the recalculated asset
    management priority distribution is greater than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the First
    Calculation Period, a special payment equal to the difference
    shall be paid by the Fund to AMB Japan at the time of such
    recalculation. If the recalculated asset management priority
    distribution is equal to or less than the amount previously
    earned by AMB Japan with respect to the First Calculation
    Period, no additional amount shall be paid by the Fund to AMB
    Japan and no refund of such difference shall be paid by AMB
    Japan to the Fund.

(ii) For the period from April 1, 2007 through the
    Supplemental Capital Call Date (the “Second Calculation
    Period”), the asset management priority distribution will
    be recalculated based on the greater of 80.0 percent of the
    aggregate capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent
    of the unreturned capital contributions. If the recalculated
    asset management priority distribution is greater than the
    amount previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Second
    Calculation Period, a special payment equal to the difference
    shall be paid by the Fund to AMB Japan at the time of such
    recalculation. If the recalculated asset management priority
    distribution is equal to or less than the amount previously
    earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Second Calculation
    Period, no additional amount shall be paid by the Fund to AMB
    Japan and no refund of such difference shall be paid by AMB
    Japan to the Fund.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund recorded
    asset management priority distributions of approximately ¥
    460.2 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund owed
    ¥ 1.2 billion, for asset management priority
    distributions, which are included in distributions payable in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, AMB Japan
    receives incentive distributions equal to 20.0 percent of
    the amount over a 10.0 percent net nominal internal rate of
    return (“IRR”) accruing to the limited partners. The
    incentive distributions increase to 25.0 percent of the
    amount over a 13.0 percent IRR accruing to the limited
    partners. As of December 31, 2007, no incentive
    distributions have been paid or accrued.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2007

(Report not required)

AMB, the indirect owner of AMB Japan, obtains company-wide
    insurance coverage from third parties that apply to all
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including the Properties. As
    such, the Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance
    expense incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Fund recorded insurance expense of
    approximately ¥ 161.9 million.

At certain properties, AMB Property Japan earns a leasing
    commission when it has acted as the listing broker or the
    procuring broker or both. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, AMB Property Japan earned
    ¥ 26.0 million.

Pursuant to the Accounting Service Agreements with certain TMKs,
    AMB Property Japan earns an accounting fee for maintaining the
    books and records with respect to their properties. During the
    year ended December 31, 2007, AMB Property Japan earned
    ¥ 5.9 million.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. Management of the Fund believes that the
    policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate
    and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk
    of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Fund’s properties are located in
    areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Fund has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although the Fund has
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that management of the Fund
    believes are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the
    Fund will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Fund.

    partners’ capital and of cash flows present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of AMB Japan
    Fund I, L.P. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
    2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 and the period from
    Inception (June 30, 2005) to December 31, 2005 in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (denominated in Yen). These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
    audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
    obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable

AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December
    31, 2006

1.

Organization

On May 19, 2005, AMB Japan Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Japan”) and AMB Property II, L.P. as limited partner,
    formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the “Fund”), a
    Cayman Islands-exempted limited partnership. On June 30,
    2005 (“Inception”), 13 institutional investors were
    admitted as limited partners to the Fund and AMB Property II,
    L.P. withdrew as a limited partner.

On June 30, 2005, AMB Japan contributed its
    80.81 percent indirect equity interest with an agreed value
    of ¥11.9 billion in two operating properties (the
    “Properties”), consisting of six industrial buildings
    aggregating 0.9 million square feet (unaudited) to the Fund
    in exchange for a one percent general partnership interest in
    the Fund and ¥5.4 billion in cash. At Inception, the
    limited partners collectively made cash contributions of
    ¥5.7 billion to the Fund in exchange for a
    99.0 percent collective limited partnership interest in the
    Fund.

The limited partners have collectively committed
    ¥49.5 billion in equity to the Fund and AMB Japan, as
    general partner, has committed ¥0.5 billion in equity
    to the Fund. In addition, AMB Property Singapore Pte. Ltd.
    (“AMB Singapore”) has committed
    ¥11.9 billion in equity to co-invest with the Fund in
    properties. As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had completed
    four capital calls totaling ¥17.5 billion from the
    limited partners and non-cash contributions from the general
    partner totaling ¥0.2 billion, respectively.

The Fund and AMB Singapore co-invest (80.81 percent and
    19.19 percent, respectively) in Singapore private limited
    companies (“PTEs”) which indirectly own industrial
    real estate in Japan. The Properties are owned individually in
    Japanese Tokutei Mokuteki Kaishas (“TMKs”). TMKs are
    asset-backed entities subject to tax on income net of
    distributions. Distributions from TMKs to non-residents are
    subject to local withholding taxes.

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund indirectly owned
    80.81 percent of 12 operating buildings aggregating
    3.8 million square feet (unaudited). The Properties are
    located in the following submarkets of Tokyo: Funabashi,
    Kashiwa, Kawasaki, Narita, Ohta, and Saitama, and a submarket of
    Osaka: Amagasaki.

2.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“U.S. GAAP”) in Yen currency. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the
    Fund and the joint ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s joint
    ventures are reflected as minority interests in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Functional and Reporting Currency.

The Yen is
    both the functional and reporting currency for the Fund’s
    operations. Functional currency is the currency of the primary
    economic environment in which the Fund operates. Monetary assets
    and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Yen are
    remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently

S-47


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December
    31, 2006

uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future
    economic and market conditions and the availability of capital.
    If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to
    the carrying value of the Fund’s long-lived assets could
    occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To
    the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the
    carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is
    charged to income and is included on the consolidated statements
    of operations. There were no impairments of the carrying values
    of its investments in real estate as of December 31, 2006
    and 2005.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    investments in real estate. The estimated lives are as follows:

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Estimated Lives

Building and seismic costs

40 years

Parking, plumbing and utility

25 years

Expansions, roof, HVAC and other

20 years

Furniture, fixtures and other

10 years

Signage and common areas

7 years

Painting and other

5 years

Ground lease

Lesser of lease term or 40 years

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in the property
    including legal fees and acquisition costs.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

The Fund records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. At
    December 31, 2006, the Fund has recorded intangible assets
    and liabilities in the amounts of ¥111.0 million,
    ¥816.3 million, and ¥61.9 million for the
    value attributable to below-market leases, in-place leases, and
    lease origination costs, respectively, which are included in
    buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets. The value attributable to below-market leases is
    amortized over the average lease term, approximately
    3.9 years, and the amortization is included in rental
    revenues in the accompanying statements of operations. The value
    attributable to in-place leases and lease origination costs is
    amortized over the initial lease term, ranging from
    3.9 years to 9.9 years, and the amortization expense
    is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the
    accompanying statements of operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    reserves required to be held pursuant to Agreements with Chuo
    Mitsui Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. (“Chuo
    Mitsui”), JP Morgan Trust Bank, Ltd. (“JP
    Morgan”), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation
    (“SMBC”) and Shinsei Bank, Limited, as well as cash
    held in escrow under the terms of the Loan Agreement with JP
    Morgan. Pursuant to these agreements, minimum levels of cash are
    required to be held as reserves for operating expenses, real
    estate taxes and insurance reserves, consumption tax and
    maintenance reserves. Restricted cash also includes cash held
    directly by the Fund as collateral for a ¥2.6 billion
    secured loan payable in connection with the Fund’s
    acquisition of Higashi-Ogijima Distribution Center, which was
    acquired indirectly by an entity of which the Fund owns
    80.81 percent. Upon repayment of this secured loan payable,
    the cash will become unrestricted.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related debt. As of December 31, 2006,
    deferred financing costs were ¥547.3 million, net of
    accumulated amortization.

AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December
    31, 2006

Financial Instruments.

SFAS No. 133,
    Accounting for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging
    Activities, provides comprehensive guidelines for the
    recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging
    activities and, specifically, requires all derivatives to be
    recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income or loss. The Fund’s derivative financial instruments
    in effect at December 31, 2006 were four interest rate
    swaps, hedging cash flows of the Fund’s variable rate bonds
    based on Tokyo Inter-bank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”) plus
    a margin. Adjustments to the fair value of these instruments for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted in a loss of
    ¥7.4 million, net of minority interest. There were no
    other derivative financial instruments included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income or loss for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. There was no impact on accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 as the Fund did not have any derivative
    financial instruments. This loss is included in accounts
    payables and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet and other comprehensive income in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of partners’ capital.

Mortgage and Bond Premiums.

Mortgage and bond
    premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt over the
    principal value of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions.
    The mortgage and bond premiums are being amortized into interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2006, the
    unamortized mortgage and bond premiums were approximately
    ¥57.4 million.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent a 19.19 percent indirect equity interest in the
    Properties held by AMB Singapore. Such investments are
    consolidated because the Fund owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Fund are allocated to each of the partners in accordance
    with the respective partnership agreements as amended. Partner
    distributions are expected to be made on a semi-annual basis
    when distributable proceeds are available. Distributions, other
    than priority distributions (Note 8), are made to each of
    the partners in accordance with their respective ownership
    interests at the time of the distribution.

Rental Revenues.

The Fund, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. The Fund recorded ¥28.4 million and
    ¥14.2 million of revenue related to the amortization
    of lease intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2006
    and for the period from Inception to December 31, 2005,
    respectively. The lease intangibles are being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Fund in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Fund’s ability to lease space and on
    the level of rent that can be achieved. The Fund had five
    tenants that accounted for 53.0 percent of rental revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Fund’s financial instruments include a mortgage loan
    payable, bonds payable and secured loans payable. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Fund at December 31, 2006,
    the estimated fair market value of the financial instruments was
    ¥53.4 billion.

3.

Real
    Estate Acquisition Activity

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Fund acquired
    an 80.81 percent equity interest in entities that
    indirectly own four operating properties aggregating
    2.6 million square feet (unaudited) from AMB Japan. AMB
    Singapore retained 19.19 percent of the equity interest in

Debt

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had one mortgage loan
    payable totaling ¥2.7 billion, not including an
    unamortized mortgage premium of approximately
    ¥25.5 million. The mortgage loan payable bears
    interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures in
    2011.

The mortgage loan payable is collateralized by certain of the
    Properties and requires interest only payments to be made
    quarterly until maturity in 2011. In addition, the mortgage loan
    payable has various covenants such as maintaining debt service
    coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.
    Management of the Fund believes that the Fund was in compliance
    with these covenants as of December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had one collateralized
    bond payable totaling ¥3.4 billion, not including an
    unamortized bond premium of ¥31.9 million. The bond
    bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures
    in 2011. Principal amortization on this bond begins in June 2007.

If at any such time, the principal outstanding on the
    ¥3.4 billion bond payable reaches the balance of the
    principal outstanding on the ¥2.7 billion mortgage
    loan payable, amortization of principal would then be applied on
    a pro rata basis of 50.0 percent to the bond payable and
    50.0 percent to the mortgage loan payable.

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had four collateralized
    specified bonds payable totaling ¥35.2 billion. The
    bonds bear interest at rates per annum equal to the rates of the
    TIBOR and Yen London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”)
    plus a margin ranging from 85 to 155 basis points and
    mature between 2012 and 2013. To hedge the cash flows of these
    floating rate borrowings, the Fund purchased interest swaps,
    which have fixed the interest rates payable on principal amounts
    totaling ¥31.2 billion at rates ranging from
    1.32 percent to 1.60 percent per annum. Including the
    interest rate swaps, the effective borrowing cost for the
    ¥35.2 billion bonds is 2.65 percent per annum.

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had secured loans payable
    totaling ¥12.4 billion:

(i) The ¥2.6 billion secured loan payable bears
    interest at a rate per annum equal to TIBOR plus a margin of
    20 basis points and matures in August 2007. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, the interest rate approximated
    0.410 percent per annum. The loan payable is secured by a
    restricted cash balance held directly by the Fund in a cash
    collateral account.

    1.14 percent per annum. The loan payable is secured by the
    partners’ capital commitment (“Credit Facility”).

Except for the secured loan payable of ¥9.8 billion
    due in 2008 which is held by the Fund, the Fund’s operating
    properties, mortgage loan payable, bonds payable, and secured
    loan payable are all held in Japanese TMKs which are special
    purpose companies (“SPCs”). TMKs are SPCs established
    under Japanese Asset Liquidation law. As of December 31,
    2006, the seven TMKs included in the Fund’s consolidated
    financial statements are AMB Funabashi Tokorozawa TMK, AMB
    Higashi-Ogijima TMK, AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Narita 1-1 TMK, AMB
    Amagasaki TMK, AMB Kashiwa TMK and AMB Funabashi 6 TMK. The
    Properties owned by AMB Funabashi Tokorozawa TMK collateralize
    one mortgage loan payable and one bond payable. The secured loan
    payable held by AMB Higashi-Ogijima TMK is collateralized by
    cash directly held by the Fund in a cash collateral account. The
    properties owned by AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Narita 1-1 TMK, AMB
    Amagasaki TMK and AMB Kashiwa TMK collateralize bonds payable by
    the respective entities. The creditors of the TMKs do not have
    recourse to any other assets or revenues of AMB Japan or its
    affiliated entities. Conversely, the creditors of AMB Japan and
    its affiliated entities do not have recourse to any of the
    assets or revenues of the TMKs.

Income
    and Withholding Taxes

The Fund is exempt from all forms of taxation in the Cayman
    Islands, including income, capital gains, and withholding tax.
    The foreign countries where the Fund has operations may impose
    income, withholding, and other direct and indirect taxes under
    their respective laws. Accordingly, the Fund recognizes income
    taxes for these jurisdictions in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
    as necessary. As of December 31, 2006, the Fund has accrued
    a current tax liability of ¥61.3 million, representing
    future withholding taxes on distributions from operations in
    Japan and Singapore. The Fund also accrued a deferred tax asset
    of ¥34.5 million, as of December 31, 2006. These
    amounts are included in accounts payable and other liabilities
    and accounts receivables and other assets in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.

The tax consequences for each partner of the Fund of acquiring,
    holding, or disposing of partnership interests will depend upon
    the relevant laws of any jurisdiction to which the partner is
    subject.

Transactions
    with Affiliates

During the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Japan
    contributed its equity interest in five Singapore PTE entities
    which owned an 80.81 percent indirect interest in four
    operating properties, aggregating 2.6 million square feet
    (unaudited) to the Fund. As of December 31, 2006, the Fund
    has an obligation of ¥56.6 million, payable to AMB
    Japan, related to the unpaid portion of the contribution value
    for the Singapore PTE entities, which is included in net
    payables to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheet.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Fund made debt
    financed distributions of ¥9.8 billion to AMB Japan
    related to the unpaid portion of the contributions value for the
    Singapore PTE entities contributed at Inception and during the
    year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2005,
    ¥2.6 billion was included in net payables to
    affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The contribution values of the Singapore PTEs contributed to the
    Fund at Inception were determined based on estimated fair market
    values of the net assets of each PTE as of June 30, 2005.

determination of the Singapore PTE net assets was the fair
    market value of the Properties. The fair market value of the
    Properties was determined based on an appraisal conducted by an
    independent third party. In September 2005, the June 30,
    2005 estimated fair market values of the net assets of the PTEs
    were adjusted to reflect final valuations.

Pursuant to the Co-Investment Agreement, AMB Singapore has an
    obligation to contribute 19.19 percent in capital (debt or
    equity) towards acquisitions of properties. As of
    December 31, 2005, AMB Singapore had issued unsecured,
    non-interest bearing loans in the amount of
    ¥139.2 million to an 80.81 percent controlled
    subsidiary of the Fund as funding for acquisition of properties.
    During the year ended December 31, 2006, these loans were
    converted into equity in this subsidiary of the Fund.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
    Agreement and the Co-Investment Agreement, AMB Japan receives an
    acquisition fee equal to 0.9 percent of the Fund’s
    share of the acquisition cost of properties purchased from third
    parties. This acquisition fee is reduced by a 0.4 percent
    acquisition fee AMB Singapore receives of the acquisition cost
    of properties purchased from third parties who are referred to
    the Fund by AMB Singapore.

In relation to the acquisition of Higashi-Ogijima Distribution
    Center, AMB Higashi-Ogijima TMK paid an acquisition fee of
    ¥63.4 million to AMB Blackpine Ltd
    (“Blackpine”), a 50/50 joint venture between AMB
    Headlands Japan LLC, an indirect subsidiary of AMB Property
    Corporation (“AMB”), and a team of real estate
    professionals in Japan. During the year ended December 31,
    2006, AMB acquired the 50.0 percent of Blackpine that AMB
    did not previously own, and AMB has combined the operation of
    Blackpine with its wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary, AMB
    Property Japan, Inc., the Japan branch of AMB (“AMB
    Property Japan”). This acquisition fee was capitalized and
    included in investments in real estate in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2006, the
    unamortized acquisition fee was approximately
    ¥61.3 million.

In 2005, the TMKs recorded asset management fees and leasing
    commissions to Blackpine of approximately ¥7.2 million
    and ¥16.7 million, respectively. The leasing
    commissions were capitalized and included in investments in real
    estate. As of December 31, 2006, the unamortized leasing
    commissions were approximately ¥12.6 million.
    Blackpine ceased providing asset management services to the TMKs
    on January 1, 2006.

Pursuant to an asset management fees agreement, on
    January 1, 2006, AMB Property Japan began providing asset
    management services to the Properties. The asset management fee
    is payable monthly. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    the Fund recorded asset management fees of approximately
    ¥54.5 million.

Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, AMB Singapore
    receives management service fees, payable on a quarterly basis,
    equal to 0.25 percent of capital (equity and debt)
    contributed to each PTE by the Fund and AMB Singapore. For the
    year ended December 31, 2006, and for the period from
    Inception to December 31, 2005, the PTEs recorded
    management service fees of approximately ¥18.6 million
    and ¥7.7 million, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Fund owed ¥7.9 million,
    for management service fees which are included in net payables
    to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement from June 30,
    2005 to June 30, 2006, AMB Japan, as general partner,
    receives asset management priority distributions equal to
    1.5 percent per annum, payable on a quarterly basis, of
    aggregate capital commitments made to the Fund from the
    effective date of the agreement through the Supplemental Capital
    Call Date (as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement).
    Pursuant to the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated
    Agreement of Limited Partnership, effective from July 1,
    2006, the asset management priority distribution base changed
    from 100 percent to 90.0 percent of the aggregate
    capital commitments to the Fund until the earlier of
    90.0 percent of capital commitments being called or the
    Supplement Call Date (as defined in the Limited Partnership
    Agreement), and thereafter until the Supplement Call Date, the
    base will be the called but unreturned capital contributions.
    Subsequent to the Supplemental Capital Call Date, AMB Japan
    receives asset management priority distributions equal to
    1.5 percent per annum, payable on a quarterly basis, of the
    unreturned capital contributions. Both amounts referred to above
    are reduced by amounts paid or

    regarding asset management fees. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Fund recorded asset management
    priority distributions of approximately
    ¥654.4 million. For the period from Inception to
    December 31, 2005, the Fund recorded asset management
    priority distributions of approximately
    ¥367.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Fund
    owed ¥1.0 billion, for asset management priority
    distributions, which are included in distributions payable in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, AMB Japan
    receives incentive distributions equal to 20.0 percent of
    the amount over a 10.0 percent net nominal internal rate of
    return (“IRR”) accruing to the limited partners. The
    incentive distributions increase to 25.0 percent of the
    amount over a 13.0 percent IRR accruing to the limited
    partners. As of December 31, 2006, no incentive
    distributions have been paid or accrued.

AMB, the asset manager for AMB Japan, obtains company-wide
    insurance coverage from third parties that applies to all
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including the Properties. As
    such, the Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance
    expense incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated
    to the Properties amounted to ¥108.9 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 and ¥24.1 million
    for the period from Inception to December 31, 2005.

9.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. Management of the Fund believes that the
    policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate
    and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk
    of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Fund’s properties are located in
    areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Fund has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although the Fund has
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that management of the Fund
    believes are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the
    Fund will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Fund.

10.

Subsequent
    Events (Unaudited)

Subsequent to December 31, 2006, the Fund acquired
    approximately ¥31.4 billion of operating properties,
    obtained secured loans payable and bonds payable of
    approximately ¥27.0 billion, and repaid
    ¥6.1 billion in bonds and secured loans payable, in
    the ordinary course of business.
