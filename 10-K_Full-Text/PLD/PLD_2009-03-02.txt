FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS

Some of the information included in this annual report on

Form 10-K

contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to
    the safe-harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Because these
    forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and
    uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our
    actual results to differ materially from those in the
    forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the
    forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The
    events or circumstances reflected in the forward-looking
    statements might not occur. You can identify forward-looking
    statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as
    “believes,” “expects,” “may,”
    “will,” “should,” “seeks,”
    “approximately,” “intends,”
    “plans,” “forecasting,” “pro
    forma,” “estimates” or “anticipates,”
    or the negative of these words and phrases, or similar words or
    phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by
    discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking
    statements should not be read as guarantees of future
    performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate
    indicators of whether, or the time at which, such performance or
    results will be achieved. There is no assurance that the events
    or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements will
    occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements are necessarily
    dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect
    or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual
    results and future events to differ materially from those set
    forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:

•

changes in general economic conditions, global trade or in
    the real estate sector (including risks relating to decreasing
    real estate valuations and impairment charges);

•

risks associated with using debt to fund our business
    activities, including re-financing and interest rate risks;

•

our failure to obtain, renew, or extend necessary financing
    or access the debt or equity markets;

•

our failure to maintain our current credit agency ratings or
    comply with our debt covenants;

•

risks related to our obligations in the event of certain
    defaults under co-investment venture and other debt;

    the global economy or real estate conditions and other financial
    market fluctuations;

•

defaults on or non-renewal of leases by customers or renewal
    at lower than expected rent;

•

risks and uncertainties relating to the disposition of
    properties to third parties and our ability to effect such
    transactions on advantageous terms and to timely reinvest
    proceeds from any such dispositions;

•

our failure to contribute properties to our co-investment
    ventures due to such factors as our inability to acquire,
    develop, or lease properties that meet the investment criteria
    of such ventures, or our co-investment ventures’ inability
    to access debt and equity capital to pay for property
    contributions or their allocation of available capital to cover
    other capital requirements such as future redemptions;

•

difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in
    effecting acquisitions on advantageous terms and the failure of
    acquisitions to perform as we expect;

•

risks and uncertainties affecting property development,
    redevelopment and value-added conversion (including construction
    delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits
    and financing, our inability to lease properties at all or at
    favorable rents and terms, public opposition to these
    activities);

•

risks of doing business internationally and global expansion,
    including unfamiliarity with new markets and currency risks;

•

risks of changing personnel and roles;

    as amended.

Our success also depends upon economic trends generally,
    various market conditions and fluctuations and those other risk
    factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in
    Item 1A of this report. We caution you not to place undue
    reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our
    analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or as of

PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

The
    Company

AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation, organized in
    1997, owns, acquires, develops and operates industrial
    properties in key distribution markets tied to global trade in
    the Americas, Europe and Asia. We use the terms “industrial
    properties” or “industrial buildings” to describe
    various types of industrial properties in our portfolio and use
    these terms interchangeably with the following: logistics
    facilities, centers or warehouses; distribution facilities,
    centers or warehouses; High Throughput
    Distribution

®

(HTD

®

)

    facilities; or any combination of these terms. We use the term
    “owned and managed” to describe assets in which we
    have at least a 10% ownership interest, we are the property or
    asset manager and we currently intend to hold for the long term.
    We use the term “joint venture” to describe all joint
    ventures, which include co-investment ventures, as well as
    ventures with third parties. We earn asset management
    distributions or fees, or earn incentive distributions or
    promote interests from the joint ventures. In certain cases, we
    might provide development, leasing, property management

and/or

accounting services, for which we may receive compensation. We
    use the term “co-investment venture” to describe joint
    ventures with institutional investors that are managed by us,
    from which we receive acquisition fees for third-party
    acquisitions, portfolio and asset management distributions or
    fees, as well as incentive distributions or promote interests.

We operate our business primarily through our subsidiary, AMB
    Property, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer
    to as the “operating partnership.” As of
    December 31, 2008, we owned an approximate 96.6% general
    partnership interest in the operating partnership, excluding
    preferred units. As the sole general partner of the operating
    partnership, we have the full, exclusive and complete
    responsibility for and discretion in its day-to-day management
    and control.

We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate
    investment trust and expect that we have qualified, and will
    continue to qualify, as a real estate investment trust for
    federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended
    December 31, 1997. As a self-administered and self-managed
    real estate investment trust, our own employees perform our
    corporate administrative and management functions, rather than
    our relying on an outside manager for these services. We manage
    our portfolio of properties generally through direct property
    management performed by our own employees. Additionally, within
    our flexible operating model, we may from time to time establish
    relationships with third-party real estate management firms,
    brokers and developers that provide some property-level
    administrative and management services under our direction.

Our global headquarters are located at Pier 1, Bay 1,
    San Francisco, California 94111; our telephone number is

(415) 394-9000.

Our other principal office locations are in Amsterdam, Boston,
    Chicago, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Shanghai, Singapore and
    Tokyo. As of December 31, 2008, we employed 645
    individuals: 171 in our San Francisco headquarters, 46 in
    our Boston office, 54 in our Tokyo office, 58 in our Amsterdam
    office, 64 in our Mexico City office and the remainder in our
    other offices.

Investment
    Strategy

Our strategy focuses on providing industrial distribution
    warehouse space to customers whose businesses are tied to global
    trade and who value the efficient movement of goods through the
    global supply chain. Our properties are primarily located in the
    world’s busiest distribution markets: large,
    supply-constrained infill locations with dense populations and
    proximity to airports, seaports and major highway systems. When
    measured by annualized base rent, on an owned and managed basis,
    a substantial majority of our portfolio of industrial properties
    is located in our target markets and much of this is in infill
    submarkets within our target markets. Infill locations are
    characterized by supply constraints on the availability of land
    for competing projects as well as physical, political or
    economic barriers to new development.

In many of our target markets, we focus on
    HTD

®

facilities, which are buildings designed to facilitate the rapid
    distribution of our customers’ products rather than the
    storage of goods. Our investment focus on
    HTD

®

assets is based on what we believe to be a global trend toward
    lower inventory levels and expedited supply chains.
    HTD

®



facilities generally have a variety of physical characteristics
    that allow for the rapid transport of goods from point-to-point.
    These physical characteristics could include numerous dock
    doors, shallower building depths, fewer columns, large truck
    courts and more space for trailer parking. We believe that these
    building characteristics help our customers to reduce their
    costs and become more efficient in their delivery systems. Our
    customers include air express, logistics and freight forwarding
    companies that have time-sensitive needs, and that value
    facilities located in convenient proximity to transportation
    infrastructure, such as major airports and seaports.

As of December 31, 2008, we owned, or had investments in,
    on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated co-investment
    ventures, properties and development projects expected to total
    approximately 160.0 million square feet (14.9 million
    square meters) in 49 markets within 15 countries. Additionally,
    as of December 31, 2008, we managed, but did not have an
    ownership interest in, industrial and other properties totaling
    approximately 1.1 million rentable square feet.

Of the approximately 160.0 million square feet as of
    December 31, 2008:

•

on an owned and managed basis, which includes investments held
    on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint
    ventures, we owned or partially owned approximately
    131.5 million square feet (principally, warehouse
    distribution buildings) that were 95.1% leased; we had
    investments in 53 development projects, which are expected to
    total approximately 16.4 million square feet upon
    completion; and we owned 16 development projects, totaling
    approximately 4.6 million square feet, which are available
    for sale or contribution;

•

through non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, we had
    investments in 46 industrial operating properties, totaling
    approximately 7.4 million square feet; and

•

we held approximately 0.1 million square feet through a
    ground lease, which is the location of our global headquarters.

Operating
    Strategy

We believe that real estate is fundamentally a local business
    and is best operated by local teams in each of our markets. As a
    vertically integrated company, we actively manage our portfolio
    of properties. In select markets, we may, from time to time,
    establish relationships with third-party real estate management
    firms, brokers and developers that provide some property-level
    administrative and management services under our direction. We
    offer a broad array of service offerings, including access to
    multiple locations worldwide and build-to-suit developments.

Long Term
    Growth Strategies

Growth
    through Operations

We seek to generate long-term internal growth through rent
    increases on existing space and renewals on rollover space,
    striving to maintain a high occupancy rate at our properties and
    to control expenses by capitalizing on the economies of scale
    inherent in owning, operating and growing a large, global
    portfolio. We actively manage our portfolio, whether directly or
    with an alliance partner, by establishing leasing strategies and
    negotiating lease terms, pricing, and level and timing of
    property improvements. We believe that our long-standing focus
    on customer relationships and ability to provide global
    solutions in fifteen countries for a well-diversified customer
    base in the shipping, air cargo and logistics industries will
    enable us to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.

We believe that our properties benefit from cost efficiencies
    produced by an experienced, cycle-tested operations team
    attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and
    from our ongoing programs to ensure that our property management
    personnel remain focused on customer relations. Our goal is to
    be well-situated to attract new customers and achieve solid
    rental rates as a result of properties that are well-located,
    well-designed and well-maintained, a reputation for high-quality
    building services and responsiveness to customers and an ability
    to offer expansion, consolidation and relocation alternatives
    within our submarkets.



Growth
    through Development

We think that the development, redevelopment and expansion of
    well-located, high-quality industrial properties provide us with
    attractive investment opportunities at higher rates of return
    than may be obtained from the purchase of existing properties.
    Through the deployment of our in-house development and
    redevelopment expertise, we seek to create value both through
    new construction and the acquisition and management of
    redevelopment opportunities. Additionally, we believe that our
    historical focus on infill locations creates a unique
    opportunity to enhance value through the select conversion of
    industrial properties to higher and better uses, within our
    value-added conversion business. Value-added conversion projects
    generally involve a significant enhancement or a change in use
    of the property from industrial distribution warehouse to a
    higher and better use, such as office, retail or residential.
    New developments, redevelopments and value-added conversions
    require significant management attention, and development and
    redevelopment require significant capital investment, to
    maximize their returns. Completed development and redevelopment
    properties are generally contributed to our co-investment
    ventures and held in our owned and managed portfolio or sold to
    third parties. Value-added conversion properties are generally
    sold to third parties at some point in the
    re-entitlement/conversion process, thus recognizing the enhanced
    value of the underlying land that supports the property’s
    repurposed use. We think our global market presence and
    expertise will enable us to generate and capitalize on a diverse
    range of development opportunities in the long term. At this
    time, however, while development, redevelopment and value added
    conversions will continue to be a fundamental part of our long
    term growth strategy, we will limit this activity to situations
    where we are fulfilling prior commitments until the financial
    and real estate markets stabilize.

Although we have reduced our development staff in correlation to
    reduced levels of development activity, our core team possesses
    multidisciplinary backgrounds, which positions us to complete
    the build out of our development pipeline and for future
    development or redevelopment opportunities when stability
    returns to the financial and real estate markets. We believe our
    development team has extensive experience in real estate
    development, both with us and with local, national or
    international development firms. We pursue development projects
    directly and in co-investment ventures and development joint
    ventures, providing us with the flexibility to pursue
    development projects independently or in partnerships, depending
    on market conditions, submarkets or building sites and
    availability of capital.

Growth
    through Acquisitions and Capital Redeployment

Our acquisition experience and our network of property
    management, leasing and acquisition resources should continue to
    provide opportunities for growth. In addition to our internal
    resources, we have long-term relationships with leasing and
    investment sales brokers, as well as third-party local property
    management firms, which may give us access to additional
    acquisition opportunities because such managers frequently
    market properties on behalf of sellers. In addition, we seek to
    redeploy capital from non-strategic assets into properties that
    better fit our current investment focus. See Part II,
    Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Summary of Key Transactions in 2008.” At this time, while
    acquisitions will continue to be a fundamental part of our long
    term growth strategy, we will limit this activity to situations
    where we are fulfilling prior commitments until the financial
    and real estate markets stabilize.

We are generally engaged in various stages of negotiations for a
    number of acquisitions and other transactions, some of which may
    be significant, that may include, but are not limited to,
    individual properties, large multi-property portfolios or
    property owning or real estate-related entities. We cannot
    assure you that we will consummate any of these transactions.
    Such transactions, if we consummate them, may be material
    individually or in the aggregate.

Growth
    through Global Expansion

Our long-term capital allocation goal is to have approximately
    50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in
    markets outside the United States based on annualized base rent.
    Expansion into target markets outside the United States
    represents a natural extension of our strategy to invest in
    industrial property markets with high population densities,
    proximity to large customer clusters and available labor pools,
    and major distribution centers serving global trade. Our
    international expansion strategy mirrors our focus in the United
    States on supply-



constrained submarkets with political, economic or physical
    constraints to new development. Our international investments
    extend our offering of
    HTD

®

facilities to customers who value speed-to-market over storage.
    We think that our established customer relationships, our
    contacts in the air cargo, shipping and logistics industries,
    our underwriting of markets and investments, our in-house
    expertise and our strategic alliances with knowledgeable
    developers and managers will assist us in competing
    internationally. For a discussion of the amount of our revenues
    attributable to the United States and international markets,
    please see Part IV, Item 15: Note 16 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Growth
    through Co-Investments

We, through AMB Capital Partners, LLC, our private capital
    group, were one of the pioneers of the real estate investment
    trust (REIT) industry’s co-investment private capital
    investment model and have more than 25 years of experience
    meeting institutional investors’ real estate needs. We
    co-invest in properties with private capital investors through
    partnerships, limited liability companies or other joint
    ventures. We have a direct and long-standing relationship with
    institutional investors. More than 60% of our owned and managed
    operating portfolio is owned through our eight co-investment
    ventures. We tailor industrial portfolios to investors’
    specific needs — in separate or commingled
    accounts — deploying capital in both close-ended and
    open-ended structures and providing complete portfolio
    management and financial reporting services. Generally, we will
    own a

10-50%

interest in our co-investment ventures. Our co-investment
    ventures typically allow us to earn acquisition and development
    fees, asset management fees or priority distributions, as well
    as promote interests or incentive distributions based on the
    performance of the co-investment ventures. As of
    December 31, 2008, we owned approximately 78.7 million
    square feet of our properties (49.2% of the total operating and
    development portfolio) through our consolidated and
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

BUSINESS
    RISKS

Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse
    consequences to us. These risks include, among others:

Risks of
    the Current Economic Environment

If the
    global market and economic crisis intensifies or continues in
    the long term, disruptions in the capital and credit markets may
    adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows
    and financial condition.

Recent global market and economic conditions have been
    unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions,
    slower growth through the fourth quarter of 2008 and recession
    in most major economies continuing into 2009. Continued concerns
    about the systemic impact of inflation, the availability and
    cost of credit, declining real estate market, energy costs and
    geopolitical issues have contributed to increased market
    volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy.
    In the fourth quarter of 2008, added concerns fueled by the
    failure of several large financial institutions and government
    interventions in the credit markets led to increased market
    uncertainty and instability in the capital and credit markets.
    These conditions, combined with declining business activity
    levels and consumer confidence, increased unemployment and
    volatile oil prices, have contributed to unprecedented levels of
    volatility in the capital markets. If the global market and
    economic crisis intensifies or continues in the long term,
    disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely
    affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and
    financial condition.

As a result of these market conditions, the cost and
    availability of credit have been and may continue to be
    adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit
    spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally
    and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many
    lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some
    cases, cease to provide funding to businesses and consumers.
    These factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses
    and consumers alike, and a corresponding decrease in global
    infrastructure spending. While we currently believe that we have
    sufficient working capital and capacity under our credit
    facilities in the near term, continued turbulence in the global
    markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and
    consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and
    financial condition, as well as the liquidity and financial
    condition of our customers. If these market conditions persist
    in the long term, they may limit our ability, and the ability of
    our customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities, and
    access the credit markets to meet liquidity needs.

If the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall
    below our current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under our
    unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans may increase.
    In addition, if the long-term debt ratings of the operating
    partnership fall below investment grade, we may be unable to
    request borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or
    Japanese Yen, as applicable; however, the lack of other currency
    borrowings does not affect our ability to fully draw down under
    the credit facilities or term loans. While we currently do not
    expect our long-term debt ratings to fall below investment
    grade, in the event that our ratings do fall below those levels,
    we may be unable to exercise our options to extend the term of
    our credit facilities or our $230 million secured term loan
    credit agreement, and the loss of our ability to borrow in
    foreign currencies could affect our ability to optimally hedge
    our borrowings against foreign currency exchange rate changes.
    In addition, while based on publicly available information
    regarding our lenders, we currently do not expect to lose
    borrowing capacity under our existing lines of credit and term
    loans as a result of a dissolution, bankruptcy, consolidation,
    merger or other business combination among our lenders, we
    cannot assure you that continuing long-term disruptions in the
    global economy and the continuation of tighter credit conditions
    among, and potential failures of, third-party financial
    institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an
    adverse effect on our borrowing capacity and liquidity position.
    Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on
    the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities
    to meet their funding commitments to us. We can not assure you
    that if one of our lenders fails (some of whom are lenders under
    a number of our facilities), we will be successful in finding a
    replacement lender and, as a result, our borrowing capacity
    under the applicable facilities may be permanently reduced. If
    we do not have sufficient cash flows and income from our
    operations to meet our financial commitments and those lenders



are not able to meet their funding commitments to us, our
    business, results of operations, cash flows and financial
    condition could be adversely affected.

Certain of our third-party indebtedness is held by our
    consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures. In the event that
    our joint venture partner is unable to meet its obligations
    under our joint venture agreements or the third-party debt
    agreements, we may elect to pay our joint venture partner’s
    portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the mortgaged property
    or permit the lender to foreclose on the mortgaged property to
    meet the joint venture’s debt obligations. In either case,
    we could face a loss of income and asset value on the property.

Until the financial and real estate markets stabilize, we have
    limited our capital deployment activities to situations where we
    are fulfilling prior commitments. There can be no assurance that
    the markets will stabilize in the near future or that we will
    choose to or be able to increase our levels of capital
    deployment at such time or ever. In addition, a continued
    increase in the cost of credit and inability to access the
    capital and credit markets may adversely impact the occupancy of
    our properties, the disposition of our properties, private
    capital raising and contribution of properties to our
    co-investment ventures. For example, an inability to fully lease
    our properties may result in such properties not meeting our
    investment criteria for contributions to our co-investment
    ventures. If we are unable to contribute completed development
    properties to our co-investment ventures or sell our completed
    development projects to third parties, we will not be able to
    recognize gains from the contribution or sale of such properties
    and, as a result, our net income available to our common
    stockholders and our funds from operations will decrease.
    Additionally, business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns
    and other similar factors that affect our customers may
    adversely impact our business and financial condition.
    Furthermore, general uncertainty in the real estate markets has
    resulted in conditions where the pricing of certain real estate
    assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to
    capitalization rates and valuations, among other things, which
    may add to the difficulty of buyers or our co-investment
    ventures to obtain financing on favorable terms to acquire such
    properties or cause potential buyers to not complete
    acquisitions of such properties. The market uncertainty with
    respect to capitalization rates and real estate valuations also
    adversely impacts our net asset value. In addition, we may face
    difficulty in refinancing our mortgage debt, or may be unable to
    refinance such debt at all, if our property values significantly
    decline. Such a decline may also cause a default under the
    loan-to-value covenants in some of our joint ventures’
    mortgage debt, which may require our joint ventures to re-margin
    or pay down a portion of the applicable debt. There can be no
    assurance, however, that in such an event, we will be able to do
    so to prevent foreclosure.

In the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us
    through our operations to continue operating our business as
    usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our
    liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation,
    divesting ourselves of properties, whether or not they otherwise
    meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term, at less
    than optimal terms; issuing and selling our debt and equity in
    public or private transactions under less than optimal
    conditions; entering into leases with our customers at lower
    rental rates or less than optimal terms; or entering into lease
    renewals with our existing customers without an increase in
    rental rates at turnover. There can be no assurance, however,
    that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be
    available to us. Additionally, taking such measures to increase
    our liquidity may adversely affect our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $223.9 million in cash
    and cash equivalents. Our available cash and cash equivalents
    are held in accounts managed by third-party financial
    institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our
    operating accounts. The invested cash is invested in money
    market funds that invest solely in direct obligations of the
    government of the United States or in time deposits with certain
    financial institutions. To date, we have experienced no loss or
    lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents;
    however, we can provide no assurances that access to our
    invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by
    adverse conditions in the financial markets.

At any point in time, we also have a significant amount of cash
    deposits in our operating accounts that are with third-party
    financial institutions, and, as of December 31, 2008, the
    amount in such deposits was approximately $176.6 million on
    a consolidated basis. These balances exceed the Federal Deposit
    Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While we monitor daily
    the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash
    balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted
    if the underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to
    other



adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have
    experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating
    accounts.

The
    price per share of our stock may decline or fluctuate
    significantly.

The market price per share of our common stock may decline or
    fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including:

•

general market and economic conditions;

•

actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating
    results or dividends or our payment of dividends in shares of
    our stock;

•

changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•

difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or
    refinance existing debt;

•

breaches of covenants and defaults under our credit facilities
    and other debt;

•

decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations;

•

publication of research reports about us or the real estate
    industry;

•

the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the
    attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other
    equity securities (including securities issued by other real
    estate-based companies);

•

general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in
    interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead
    prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual
    yield from future dividends;

•

a change in analyst ratings or our credit ratings;

•

changes in market valuations of similar companies;

•

adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the
    future;

•

additions or departures of key management personnel;

•

actions by institutional stockholders;

•

speculation in the press or investment community;

•

terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our
    securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and
    causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence
    and spending;

•

governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and

•

the realization of any of the other risk factors included or
    incorporated by reference in this report.

Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These
    factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock
    to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of
    operations, business or our prospects.

Debt
    Financing Risks

We
    face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business
    activities, including refinancing and interest rate
    risks.

As of December 31, 2008, we had total debt outstanding of
    $4.0 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we guaranteed
    $1.2 billion of the operating partnership’s
    obligations with respect to the senior debt securities
    referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks
    normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that
    our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of
    principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a
    small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity.
    Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion
    of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we
    may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of
    any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our
    existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal
    payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other
    capital



transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be
    sufficient in all years to repay all such maturing debt and to
    pay cash dividends to our stockholders. Furthermore, if
    prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of
    refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make
    commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates
    upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that
    refinanced indebtedness would increase. Higher interest rates on
    newly incurred debt may negatively impact us as well. If
    interest rates increase, our interest costs and overall costs of
    capital will increase, which could adversely affect our
    financial condition, results of operation and cash flow, the
    market price of our stock, our ability to pay principal and
    interest on our debt, our ability to pay cash dividends to our
    stockholders and our capital deployment activity. In addition,
    there may be circumstances that will require us to obtain
    amendments or waivers to provisions in our credit facilities or
    other financings. There can be no assurance that we will be able
    to obtain necessary amendments or waivers at all or without
    significant expense. In such case, we may not be able to fund
    our business activities as planned, within budget or at all.

In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to
    secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet
    mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or
    transferred to the lender with a consequent loss of income and
    asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to our
    stockholders, and the market price of our stock.

As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding bank guarantees
    in the amount of $27.8 million used to secure contingent
    obligations, primarily obligations under development and
    purchase agreements, including $0.7 million guaranteed
    under a purchase agreement entered into by an unconsolidated
    joint venture. As of December 31, 2008, we also guaranteed
    $49.6 million and $231.8 million on outstanding loans
    for six of our consolidated co-investment ventures and four of
    our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, respectively, as well
    as the following credit facility held by AMB Europe Fund I,
    FCP-FIS, one of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. In
    December 2008, we agreed to guarantee 50.2 million Euros
    (approximately $70.1 million in U.S. dollars using the
    exchange rate as of December 31, 2008) that our
    European affiliate borrowers

and/or

their
    affiliates borrowed under an existing credit facility held by
    AMB Europe Fund  I, FCP-FIS. The European affiliate
    borrowers are in the process of granting security interests to
    the lender, as the security agent, under and in accordance with
    the terms of such facility, all of which security interests are
    expected to become effective in the first half of 2009. We
    agreed to guarantee the 50.2 million Euro amount borrowed
    under such existing credit facility only until the security
    interests are granted, at which time the guarantees will be
    extinguished. Also, we have entered into contribution agreements
    with certain of our unconsolidated co-investment venture funds.
    These contribution agreements require us to make additional
    capital contributions to the applicable co-investment venture
    fund upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of its
    debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital
    contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than our share of the co-investment venture’s debt
    obligation or the value of our share of any property securing
    such debt. Our contribution obligations under these agreements
    will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the
    fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the
    debt and obtained by the lender upon default. Our potential
    obligations under these contribution agreements were
    $260.6 million as of December 31, 2008. We intend to
    continue to guarantee debt of our unconsolidated co-investment
    venture funds and make additional contributions to our
    unconsolidated co-investment venture funds in connection with
    property contributions to the funds. Such payment obligations
    under such guarantees and contribution obligations under such
    contribution agreements, if required to be paid, could be of a
    magnitude that could adversely affect our financial condition,
    results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash
    dividends to our stockholders and the market price of our stock.

Adverse
    changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our
    financing activity.

The credit ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt and
    preferred stock are based on our operating performance,
    liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and
    other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their
    rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount
    of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of
    any debt we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be
    able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event
    our current credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur
    higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining
    additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings
    may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences
    under our current and future credit facilities



and debt instruments. For example, if our credit ratings of our
    senior unsecured long-term debt are downgraded to below
    investment grade levels, we may not be able to obtain or
    maintain extensions on certain of our existing debt. Adverse
    changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our
    refinancing activities, our ability to manage our debt
    maturities, our future growth, our financial condition, the
    market price of our stock, and our development and acquisition
    activity.

Covenants
    in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness
    require that we comply with a number of financial and other
    covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and
    leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These
    covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our
    failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default
    under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied
    our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2008, we had
    certain non-recourse, secured loans, which are
    cross-collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on
    any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such
    indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to
    avoid foreclosure on all the cross-collateralized properties
    within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or
    our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could
    adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders
    and the market price of our stock. In addition, our credit
    facilities and senior debt securities contain certain
    cross-default provisions, which are triggered in the event that
    our other material indebtedness is in default. These
    cross-default provisions may require us to repay or restructure
    the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition
    to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders
    and the market price of our stock.

Failure
    to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rates may
    adversely affect results of operations.

We seek to manage our exposure to exchange and interest rate
    volatility by using exchange and interest rate hedging
    arrangements, such as cap agreements and swap agreements. These
    agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the
    counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these
    arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in
    reducing our exposure to exchange or interest rate changes and
    that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally
    enforceable. Hedging may reduce overall returns on our
    investments. Failure to hedge effectively against exchange and
    interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our
    results of operations.

We are
    dependent on external sources of capital.

In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we are
    required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least
    90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income
    (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and
    by excluding any net capital gain) and are subject to tax to the
    extent our income is not fully distributed. While historically
    we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash
    distributions to our stockholders, we may choose to  satisfy
    these requirements by making distributions of cash or other
    property, including, in limited circumstances, our own stock.
    For distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or
    before December 31, 2009, recent Internal Revenue Service
    guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90% of the distribution
    requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares
    of our stock, if certain conditions are met. Assuming we
    continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash,
    we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including
    acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from
    operations and may have to rely on third-party sources of
    capital. Further, in order to maintain our real estate
    investment trust status and avoid the payment of federal income
    and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term
    basis to meet the real estate investment trust distribution
    requirements even if the then-prevailing market conditions are
    not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term borrowing
    needs could result from differences in timing between the actual
    receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax
    purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures,
    the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization
    payments. Our ability to access private debt and equity capital
    on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of
    factors, including general



market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth
    potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash
    distributions and the market price of our securities.

We
    could incur more debt, increasing our debt
    service.

As of December 31, 2008, our share of total debt-to-our
    share of total market capitalization ratio was 61.4%. Our
    definition of “our share of total market
    capitalization” is our share of total debt plus preferred
    equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See footnote
    1 to the Capitalization Ratios table contained in Part II,
    Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operation —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources” for our definitions of
    “market equity” and “our share of total
    debt.” As this ratio percentage increases directly with a
    decrease in the market price per share of our capital stock, an
    unstable market environment will impact this ratio in a volatile
    manner. However, there can be no assurance that we would not
    also become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in
    debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for
    distribution to our stockholders. Furthermore, if we become more
    highly leveraged, we may not be in compliance with the debt
    covenants contained in the agreements governing our
    co-investment ventures, which could adversely impact our private
    capital business.

Other
    Real Estate Industry Risks

Our
    performance and value are subject to general economic conditions
    and risks associated with our real estate assets.

The investment returns available from equity investments in real
    estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital
    appreciation generated by the properties, as well as the
    expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our
    properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating
    expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then
    our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders could be
    adversely affected. In addition, there are significant
    expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such
    as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs)
    that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the
    income from the property. Income from, and the value of, our
    properties may be adversely affected by:

•

changes in the general economic climate, such as the current
    one, including diminished access to or availability of capital
    (including difficulties in financing, refinancing and extending
    existing debt) and rising inflation;

•

local conditions, such as oversupply of or a reduction in demand
    for industrial space;

•

the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers;

•

competition from other properties;

•

our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance;

•

increased operating costs;

•

increased cost of compliance with regulations;

•

the potential for liability under applicable laws (including
    changes in tax laws); and

•

disruptions in the global supply chain caused by political,
    regulatory or other factors, including terrorism.

In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession in the
    United States and in other countries, rising interest rates,
    diminished access to or availability of capital or declining
    demand for real estate, may result in a general decrease in
    rents, an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases
    or greater difficulty in financing our acquisition and
    development activities, which would adversely affect our
    financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist
    attacks may result in declining economic activity, which could
    reduce the demand for and the value of our properties. To the
    extent that future attacks impact our customers, their
    businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including
    their ability to continue to honor their existing leases.



Our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial
    real estate sector. As a result of this concentration, we feel
    the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely
    than if our portfolio included other property types.

Declining
    real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely
    affect our earnings and financial condition.

The current economic downturn has generally resulted in lower
    real estate valuations, which has required us to recognize real
    estate impairment charges on our assets. In the quarter ended
    December 31, 2008, we recognized non-cash impairment
    charges of approximately $207.2 million on an owned and
    managed basis including $195.4 million of real estate
    impairment losses ($193.9 million on a consolidated basis)
    and $11.8 million of charges for the write-off of pursuit
    costs related to development projects that we no longer plan to
    commence and reserves against tax assets associated with the
    reduction in development activity. To the extent that the book
    value of a land parcel or development asset exceeded the fair
    market value of the property, based on its intended holding
    period, a non-cash impairment charge was recognized for the
    shortfall. We examined the estimated fair value of all of our
    assets under development and assets held for sale or
    contribution. The estimated fair value of each of these assets
    was calculated based upon our intent to sell or contribute these
    properties, assumptions regarding rental rates, costs to
    complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods and sales prices or contribution values. To
    determine the fair market value for our land holdings, we
    considered our intent to sell or to develop the parcels and, in
    the case of the latter, assumptions regarding rental rates,
    costs to complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods and sales prices or contribution values are
    taken into account. There can be no assurance that the estimates
    and assumptions we use to assess impairments are accurate and
    will reflect actual results. Further deterioration in real
    estate market conditions may lead to additional impairment
    charges in the future, possibly against other assets we hold or
    of a greater magnitude than we have currently recognized. A
    worsening real estate market may cause us to reevaluate the
    assumptions used in our impairment analysis and our intent to
    hold, sell, develop or contribute properties. Impairment charges
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations and our ability to pay cash dividends to our
    stockholders and the market price of our stock. See Part IV,
    Item 15: Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the
    real estate impairment losses recorded in our results of
    operations during the fourth quarter of 2008.

We may
    be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases
    expire.

As of December 31, 2008, on an owned and managed basis,
    leases on a total of 16.8% of our industrial properties (based
    on annualized base rent) will expire on or prior to
    December 31, 2009. We derive most of our income from rent
    received from our customers. Accordingly, our financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to
    pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be
    adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew
    these expiring leases or if the rental rates upon renewal or
    reletting are significantly lower than expected. Periods of
    economic slowdown or recession are likely to adversely affect
    our leasing activities. If a customer experiences a downturn in
    its business or other type of financial distress, then it may be
    unable to make timely rental payments or renew its lease.
    Further, our ability to rent space and the rents that we can
    charge are impacted, not only by customer demand, but by the
    number of other properties we have to compete with to appeal to
    customers.

We
    could be adversely affected if a significant number of our
    customers are unable to meet their lease
    obligations.

Our results of operations, distributable cash flow and the value
    of our stock would be adversely affected if a significant number
    of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations to
    us. In the current economic environment, it is likely that
    customer bankruptcies will increase. If a customer seeks the
    protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, such
    customer’s lease may be terminated in the process and
    result in a reduction of cash flow to us. In the event of a
    significant number of lease defaults

and/or

tenant bankruptcies, our cash flow may not be sufficient to pay
    cash dividends to our stockholders and repay maturing debt and
    any other obligations. As of December 31, 2008, on an owned
    and managed basis, we did not have any single customer account
    for annualized



base rent revenues greater than 4.1%. However, in the event of
    lease defaults by a significant number of our customers, we may
    incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord.

We may
    be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous terms or at
    all.

We intend to continue to divest ourselves of properties, which
    are currently in our pipeline, are held for sale or which
    otherwise do not meet our strategic objectives, and we may, in
    certain circumstances, divest ourselves of properties to
    increase our liquidity or to capitalize on opportunities that
    arise. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous
    terms or at all depends on factors beyond our control, including
    competition from other sellers, current market conditions
    (including capitalization rates applicable to our properties)
    and the availability of financing for potential buyers of our
    properties. If we are unable to dispose of properties at all or
    on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property
    divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy, then
    our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow,
    ability to meet our debt obligations in a timely manner and
    ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and the market
    price of our stock could be adversely affected.

Actions
    by our competitors may affect our ability to divest properties
    and may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and
    rental rates of our properties.

We compete with other owners, operators and developers of real
    estate, some of which own properties similar to ours in the same
    submarkets in which our properties are located. If our
    competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in
    the same markets

and/or

at
    valuations below our valuations for comparable assets, we may be
    unable to divest our assets at all or at favorable pricing or on
    favorable terms. In addition, if our competitors offer space at
    rental rates below current market rates or below the rental
    rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential
    customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates
    below those we currently charge in order to retain customers
    when our customers’ leases expire. As a result, our
    financial condition, cash flow, cash available for distribution,
    trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our
    debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.

We may
    not be successful in contributing properties to our
    co-investment ventures.

Although we are curtailing our capital deployment activities
    until the financial and real estate markets stabilize, we may
    contribute or sell properties to our co-investment ventures on a

case-by-case

basis. However, we may fail to contribute properties to our
    co-investment ventures due to such factors as our inability to
    acquire, develop, or lease properties that meet the investment
    criteria of such ventures, or our co-investment ventures’
    inability to access debt and equity capital to pay for property
    contributions or their allocation of available capital to cover
    other capital requirements such as forward commitments, loan
    maturities and future redemptions. If the co-investment ventures
    are unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms after
    currently available capital is depleted or if the value of such
    properties are appraised at less than the cost of such
    properties, then such contributions or sales could be delayed or
    prevented, adversely affecting our financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to
    our stockholders, and the market price of our stock. For
    example, although we have acquired land for development and made
    capital commitments, we cannot be assured that we ultimately
    will be able to contribute such properties to our co-investment
    ventures as we have planned.

A delay in these contributions could result in adverse effects
    on our liquidity and on our ability to meet projected earnings
    levels in a particular reporting period. Failure to meet our
    projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could
    have an adverse effect on our results of operations,
    distributable cash flow and the value of our securities.

We are
    subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties
    owned through co-investment ventures, limited liability
    companies, partnerships and other investments.

As of December 31, 2008, approximately 89.9 million
    square feet of our properties were held through several joint
    ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with third
    parties. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of
    available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited
    liability companies or co-investment ventures, and we may
    continue to develop and acquire properties through co-investment
    ventures, limited liability



companies, partnerships with and investments in other entities
    when warranted by the circumstances. Such partners may share
    certain approval rights over major decisions and some partners
    may manage the properties in the joint venture partnership,
    limited liability company or joint venture investments.
    Partnership, limited liability company or co-investment venture
    investments involve certain risks, including:

•

if our partners, co-members or co-venturers go bankrupt, then we
    and any other remaining general partners, members or
    co-venturers may generally remain liable for the
    partnership’s, limited liability company’s or
    co-investment venture’s liabilities;

•

if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital
    contributions, then we may choose to or be required to
    contribute such capital;

•

our partners, co-members or co-venturers might have economic or
    other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our
    business interests or goals that would affect our ability to
    operate the property;

•

our partners, co-members or co-venturers may have the power to
    act contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or
    objectives, including our current policy with respect to
    maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust;

•

the joint venture, limited liability company and partnership
    agreements often restrict the transfer of a co-venturer’s,
    member’s or partner’s interest or may otherwise
    restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on
    advantageous terms;

•

our relationships with our partners, co-members or co-venturers
    are generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or
    dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event,
    we may not continue to own or operate the interests or assets
    underlying such relationship or may need to purchase such
    interests or assets at an above-market price to continue
    ownership;

•

disputes between us and our partners, co-members or
    co-investment venturers may result in litigation or arbitration
    that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and
    directors from focusing their time and effort on our business
    and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable
    partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture to
    additional risk; and

•

we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our
    partners, co-members or co-venturers.

We generally seek to maintain sufficient control or influence
    over our partnerships, limited liability companies and joint
    ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives,
    however, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one
    or more of the events described above could adversely affect our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and the market
    price of our stock.

We may
    be unable to complete renovation, development and redevelopment
    projects at all or on advantageous terms.

On a strategic and selective basis, we may develop, renovate and
    redevelop properties. In the long term after the credit markets
    stabilize, we may expand and increase our investment in our
    development, renovation and redevelopment business. The real
    estate development, renovation and redevelopment business
    involves significant risks that could adversely affect our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and the market
    price of our stock, which include the following risks:

•

we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects
    at all or on favorable terms and complete construction on
    schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service
    expense and construction costs and delays in leasing the
    properties, generating cash flow and, if applicable,
    contributing properties to a joint venture;

•

we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in
    obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy
    and other governmental permits and authorizations;

•

the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing
    cash flow below budgeted amounts;

•

we may not be able to lease properties at all or on favorable
    terms;



•

construction costs, total investment amounts and our share of
    remaining funding may exceed our estimates and projects may not
    be completed, delivered or stabilized as planned;

•

we may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced value
    created by our value-added conversion projects ever or on our
    expected timetables;

•

we may fail to contribute properties to our co-investment
    ventures due to such factors as our inability to acquire,
    develop, or lease properties that meet the investment criteria
    of such ventures, or our co-investment ventures’ inability
    to access debt and equity capital to pay for property
    contributions or their allocation of available capital to cover
    other capital requirements such as future redemptions;

•

we may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if there is
    public opposition to our activities;

•

substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment
    activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically
    require a significant amount of management’s time and
    attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day
    operations; and

•

upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain,
    or obtain on advantageous terms, permanent financing for
    activities that we have financed through construction loans.

We may
    be unable to consummate acquisitions at all or on advantageous
    terms or acquisitions may not perform as we
    expect.

On a strategic and selective basis, we may continue to acquire
    properties, primarily industrial in nature. The acquisition of
    properties entails various risks, including the risks that our
    investments may not perform or grow in value as we expect, that
    we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new
    acquisitions into our existing operations or, if applicable,
    contribute the acquired properties to a joint venture, and that
    our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to
    market standards may prove inaccurate. In addition, we expect to
    finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings
    under our unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from equity or
    debt offerings by us or the operating partnership or our
    subsidiaries and proceeds from property divestitures, which may
    not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flow.
    Further, we face significant competition for attractive
    investment opportunities from other real estate investors,
    including both publicly-traded real estate investment trusts and
    private institutional investors and funds. This competition
    increases as investments in real estate become increasingly
    attractive relative to other forms of investment. As a result of
    competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties
    as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly
    elevated. Any of the above risks could adversely affect our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the
    ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, and the
    market price of our stock.

Real
    estate investments are relatively illiquid, making it difficult
    for us to respond promptly to changing conditions.

Real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of
    assets. Further, the Internal Revenue Code regulates the number
    of properties that we, as a real estate investment trust, can
    dispose of in a year, their tax bases and the cost of
    improvements that we make to the properties. In addition, a
    portion of the properties held directly or indirectly by certain
    of our subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for
    limited partnership units in the applicable partnership. The
    contribution agreements for such properties may contain
    restrictions on certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions
    of these properties, or a portion thereof, that result in a
    taxable transaction for specified periods, following the
    contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership.
    These limitations may affect our ability to sell properties.
    This lack of liquidity and the Internal Revenue Code
    restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio
    promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions
    and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flow, the market price
    of our stock, the ability to pay cash dividends to our
    stockholders, and our ability to access capital necessary to
    meet our debt payments and other obligations.



Risks
    Associated With Our International Business

Our
    international activities are subject to special risks and we may
    not be able to effectively manage our international
    business.

We have acquired and developed, and may continue to acquire and
    develop on a strategic and selective basis, properties outside
    the United States. Because local markets affect our operations,
    our international investments are subject to economic
    fluctuations in the international locations in which we invest.
    Access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable
    entirely or on favorable terms, in certain locations. In
    addition, our international operations are subject to the usual
    risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax treaties
    or other laws and regulations, including those governing the
    taxation of our international revenues, restrictions on the
    transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world,
    uncertainty over property rights and political instability. We
    cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may
    occur. Further, we have entered, and may in the future enter,
    into agreements with

non-U.S. entities

that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute
    resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We
    cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us
    with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that
    may arise. Further, even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory
    decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could
    have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely
    basis or at all.

We also have offices in many countries outside the United States
    and, as a result, our operations may be subject to risks that
    may limit our ability to effectively establish, staff and manage
    our offices outside the United States, including:

•

differing employment practices and labor issues;

•

local business and cultural factors that differ from our usual
    standards and practices;

•

regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between
    jurisdictions; and

•

health concerns.

Our global growth (including growth in new regions in the United
    States) subjects us to certain risks, including risks associated
    with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and
    establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the
    operations of new offices. In addition, payroll expenses are
    paid in local currencies and, therefore, we are exposed to risks
    associated with fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the
    U.S. dollar and these currencies.

Further, our business has grown rapidly and may continue to grow
    in a strategic and deliberate manner. If we fail to effectively
    manage our international growth, then our financial condition,
    results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash
    dividends to our stockholders, and the market price of our stock
    could be adversely affected.

We are
    subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates
    between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other
    countries in which we invest.

We may pursue growth opportunities in international markets on a
    strategic and selective basis. As we invest in countries where
    the U.S. dollar is not the national currency, we are
    subject to international currency risks from the potential
    fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and
    the currencies of those other countries. A significant
    depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more
    countries where we have a significant investment may materially
    affect our results of operations. We attempt to mitigate any
    such effects by borrowing in the currency of the country in
    which we are investing and, under certain circumstances, by
    putting in place international currency put option contracts to
    hedge exchange rate fluctuations. For leases denominated in
    international currencies, we may use derivative financial
    instruments to manage the international currency exchange risk.
    We cannot assure you, however, that our efforts will
    successfully neutralize all international currency risks.



Acquired
    properties may be located in new markets, where we may face
    risks associated with investing in an unfamiliar
    market.

We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties on a
    strategic and selective basis in international markets that are
    new to us. When we acquire properties located in these markets,
    we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or
    understanding of the local economy, forging new business
    relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local
    government and permitting procedures. We work to mitigate such
    risks through extensive diligence and research and associations
    with experienced partners; however, there can be no guarantee
    that all such risks will be eliminated.

General
    Business Risks

Our
    performance and value are impacted by the local economic
    conditions of and the risks associated with doing business in
    California.

As of December 31, 2008, our industrial properties located
    in California represented 23.7% of the aggregate square footage
    of our industrial operating properties and 22.3% of our
    industrial annualized base rent, on an owned and managed basis.
    Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in
    California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such
    as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties)
    and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing,
    industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may
    adversely impact California’s economic climate. Because of
    the number of properties we have located in California, a
    downturn in California’s economy or real estate conditions
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to our
    stockholders and the market price of our stock.

We may
    experience losses that our insurance does not
    cover.

We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss
    insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in
    types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate
    given the relative risks applicable to the property, the cost of
    coverage and industry practice. Certain losses, such as those
    due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity, may be
    insured subject to certain limitations, including large
    deductibles or co-payments and policy limits. Although we have
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially
    reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage, we
    cannot be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on
    comparable terms or collect under such policies. In addition,
    there are other types of losses, such as those from riots,
    bio-terrorism or acts of war, that are not generally insured in
    our industry because it is not economically feasible to do so.
    We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and
    we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at
    commercially reasonable rates. Given current market conditions,
    there can also be no assurance that the insurance companies
    providing our coverage will not fail or have difficulty meeting
    their coverage obligations to us. Furthermore, we cannot assure
    you that our insurance companies will be able to continue to
    offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially
    reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or
    that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one or more of
    our properties or if our insurance companies fail to meet their
    coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss, then
    we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as
    well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties
    and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated
    for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to
    the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the
    operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of
    the operating partnership’s unsatisfied recourse
    obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating
    partnership as the general partner of co-investment ventures.
    Any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect
    our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and the market
    price of our stock.

A number of our properties are located in areas that are known
    to be subject to earthquake activity. U.S. properties
    located in active seismic areas include properties in the
    San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Our
    largest concentration of such properties is in California where,
    on an owned and managed basis, as of December 31, 2008, we
    had 296 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately
    31.2 million square feet and representing 23.7% of our
    industrial operating properties based on aggregate square
    footage and 22.3% based on industrial annualized base rent, on
    an owned and managed basis. International properties located in
    active seismic



areas include Tokyo and Osaka, Japan and Mexico City, Mexico. We
    carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in
    areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to
    coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are
    commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance
    coverage annually in light of current industry practice through
    an analysis prepared by outside consultants.

A number of our properties are located in areas that are known
    to be subject to hurricane

and/or

flood
    risk. We carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of
    our properties located in areas historically subject to such
    activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that
    we believe are commercially reasonable. We evaluate our
    insurance coverage annually in light of current industry
    practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants.

Contingent
    or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

We have acquired and may in the future acquire properties
    subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only
    limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a
    result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon
    ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might
    have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely
    affect our cash flow. Contingent or unknown liabilities with
    respect to entities or properties acquired might include:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

losses in excess of our insured coverage;

•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
    of business;

•

tax, legal and regulatory liabilities;

•

claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our
    predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions
    that had not been asserted or were unknown prior to our
    formation or acquisition transactions; and

•

claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and
    directors and others indemnified by the former owners of our
    properties.

Risks
    Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel

We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key
    employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may
    change. As part of our cost savings plan, we have reduced our
    total global headcount and may do so again in the future. While
    we believe that we have retained our key talent and left our
    global platform intact and can find suitable employees to meet
    our personnel needs, the loss of key personnel, any change in
    their roles, or the limitation of their availability could
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, and
    the market price of our stock. We do not have employment
    agreements with any of our executive officers.

Because our compensation packages include equity-based
    incentives, pressure on our stock price or limitations on our
    ability to award such incentives could affect our ability to
    offer competitive compensation packages to our executives and
    key employees. If we are unable to continue to attract and
    retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required
    to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our
    performance and competitive position could be materially
    adversely affected.

Conflicts
    of Interest Risks

Some
    of our directors and executive officers are involved in other
    real estate activities and investments and, therefore, may have
    conflicts of interest with us.

From time to time, certain of our executive officers and
    directors may own interests in other real-estate related
    businesses and investments, including de minimis holdings of the
    equity securities of public and private real estate companies.
    Our executive officers’ involvement in other real
    estate-related activities could divert their attention from our
    day-to-day operations. Our executive officers have entered into
    non-competition agreements with us



pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any
    activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial
    real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any
    industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership
    of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public
    company engaged in such activities or through certain specified
    investments. State law may limit our ability to enforce these
    agreements. We will not acquire any properties from our
    executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the
    transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and
    independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock
    Exchange) members of our board of directors with respect to that
    transaction.

Our
    role as general partner of the operating partnership may
    conflict with the interests of our stockholders.

As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have
    fiduciary obligations to the operating partnership’s
    limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the
    interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons
    holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as
    a class on certain amendments to the operating
    partnership’s partnership agreement and individually to
    approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their
    rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in
    a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders.
    In addition, under the terms of the operating partnership’s
    partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will
    have approval rights with respect to specified transactions that
    affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a
    manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders.

Risks
    Associated with Government Regulations

The
    costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and
    any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for
    these items.

Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a
    current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be
    liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of
    certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at,
    on, under, in or from its property. The costs of removal or
    remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws
    typically impose liability and

clean-up

responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator
    knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more
    than one person may have been responsible for the contamination,
    each person covered by the environmental laws may be held
    responsible for all of the

clean-up

costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or
    operator of a site for damages based on personal injury,
    property damage or other costs, including investigation and

clean-up

costs, resulting from the environmental contamination.

Environmental laws in some countries, including the United
    States, also require that owners or operators of buildings
    containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos,
    adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with
    asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or
    other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during
    building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines
    and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply
    with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek
    recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated
    with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties are known to
    contain asbestos-containing building materials.

In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been
    leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use,
    store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous
    or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of
    such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our
    properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that
    have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other
    hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have
    engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may
    release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time,
    we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with
    known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the
    environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are
    quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior
    risk-adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the
    costs of environmental investigation,

clean-up

and
    monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate
    environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection
    with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain
    responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or
    monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.



At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to
    a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent
    environmental consultants and we may have additional
    Phase II testing performed upon the consultant’s
    recommendation. These environmental assessments have not
    revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability
    that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
    Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal
    all environmental liabilities and that there are material
    environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known
    environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are
    greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties’
    current environmental condition may be affected by customers,
    the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the
    properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks) or
    by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with
    existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our
    budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to
    our stockholders, and the market price of our stock could be
    adversely affected.

Compliance
    or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act
    and other similar regulations could result in substantial
    costs.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public
    accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to
    access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result
    in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the
    award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to
    make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans
    with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then
    our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our
    stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also
    subject to various federal, state and local regulatory
    requirements, such as state and local fire and life-safety
    requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if
    we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that
    our properties are currently in material compliance with these
    regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new
    requirements may be imposed that could require significant
    unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow
    and results of operations.

Federal
    Income Tax Risks

Our
    failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have
    serious adverse consequences to our stockholders.

We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under
    Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”),
    commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997.
    We believe we have operated so as to qualify as a real estate
    investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe
    that our current organization and method of operation comply
    with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal
    Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real
    estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have
    been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow
    us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our
    future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.
    Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to
    satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a
    quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex
    sections of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only
    limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and
    involves the determination of various factual matters and
    circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in
    order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must
    derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from
    qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to our
    stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real
    estate investment trust taxable income (determined without
    regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital
    gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly
    basis. While historically we have satisfied the distribution
    requirement discussed above by making cash distributions to our
    stockholders, we may choose to satisfy this requirement by
    making distributions of cash or other property, including, in
    limited circumstances, our own stock. For distributions with
    respect to taxable years ending on or before December 31,
    2009, recent Internal Revenue Service guidance allows us to
    satisfy up to 90% of this distribution requirement through the
    distribution of shares of our stock, if certain conditions are
    met. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable
    Treasury regulations regarding qualification as a real estate
    investment trust are more complicated in our case because we
    hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation,
    new regulations, administrative interpretations or



court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with
    respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or
    the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.
    However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that
    would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate
    investment trust.

If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any
    taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax
    (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our
    taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are
    entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would
    be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust
    for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost
    our qualification. If we lost our real estate investment trust
    status, our net earnings available for investment or
    distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for
    each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be
    required to make distributions to our stockholders.

Furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain
    subsidiary REITs which elected to be taxed as a REIT under
    Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Provided that each subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our
    interest in such subsidiary REIT will be treated as a qualifying
    real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and any
    dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT
    will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes
    of the REIT gross income tests. To qualify as a REIT, the
    subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy various REIT
    qualification requirements. If such subsidiary REIT were to fail
    to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions did not
    apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and
    its income would be subject to United States federal income tax.
    In addition, a failure of the subsidiary REIT to qualify as a
    REIT would have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with
    the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify
    as a REIT.

Certain
    property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income,
    resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the
    transaction.

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some
    of our properties, including by contributing properties to our
    co-investment venture funds. Under the Internal Revenue Code,
    any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as
    inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary
    course of business is treated as income from a prohibited
    transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. We do not believe
    that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions
    of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited
    transactions. However, whether property is held for investment
    purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and
    circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The
    Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or
    dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties
    into our co-investment venture funds are prohibited
    transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service
    would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue
    Service were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition,
    or contribution of property constituted a prohibited
    transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on
    any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In
    addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely
    affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification
    as a real estate investment trust.

We may
    in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock, in which
    case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you
    receive.

We may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in our
    stock. Under IRS Revenue Procedure

2009-15,

up
    to 90% of any such taxable dividend for 2008 and 2009 could be
    payable in our stock. Taxable stockholders receiving such
    dividends will be required to include the full amount of the
    dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and
    accumulated earnings and profits for United States federal
    income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be
    required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of
    the cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it
    receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales
    proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with
    respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our
    stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to

non-U.S. stockholders,

we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to
    such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such
    dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant
    number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stock
    in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward
    pressure on the trading price of our stock.



Risks
    Associated with Ownership of Our Stock

Limitations
    in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in
    control.

Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer or
    prevent a change in control or other transaction that could
    provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to
    realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the
    common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate
    investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than
    50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or
    constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the
    Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the
    last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for
    which a real estate investment trust election is made.
    Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of
    100 persons for at least 335 days of a

12-month

taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In
    addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock,
    actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our
    customers (or a customer of any partnership in which we are a
    partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or
    through any such partnership) from that customer will not be
    qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment
    trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help
    us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust
    for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership,
    actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions
    of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than
    9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more
    restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our
    common stock, series L preferred stock, series M
    preferred stock, series O preferred stock, and
    series P preferred stock (unless such limitations are
    waived by our board of directors). We also prohibit the
    ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our
    series D preferred stock by any single person so that no
    such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by
    such person, including any common stock or other series of
    preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and
    outstanding capital stock (unless such limitations are waived by
    our board of directors). We refer to this limitation as the
    “ownership limit.” The charter provides that shares
    acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be
    transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated
    charitable beneficiary. The charter further provides that any
    person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit
    will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be
    entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the
    subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the
    price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale.
    A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be
    void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have
    the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in
    control and, therefore, could adversely affect our
    stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the
    then-prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock
    in connection with such transaction.

Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common
    and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and
    other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we
    issue. Our board of directors could establish a series or class
    of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying,
    deferring or preventing a transaction, including a change in
    control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock
    or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other
    provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders
    without the approval of our board of directors, which in turn
    may delay, defer or prevent a transaction, including a change in
    control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include:

•

directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a
    two-thirds vote of stockholders;

•

our board can fix the number of directors within set limits
    (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill
    vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the
    remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the
    case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the
    board, a majority of the entire board;

•

stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or
    propose business for consideration at a stockholders’
    meeting; and

•

the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is
    necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting.



Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include:

•

a two-thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our
    charter; and

•

stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous
    approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in
    question.

In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder
    approval, other provisions under Maryland law that may impede a
    change in control.

If we
    issue additional securities, then the investment of existing
    stockholders will be diluted.

As a real estate investment trust, we are dependent on external
    sources of capital and may issue common or preferred stock or
    debt securities to fund our future capital needs. We have
    authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or
    debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership or AMB
    Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, to issue limited
    partnership units, in exchange for property or otherwise.
    Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any
    additional securities issued by the operating partnership, AMB
    Property II, L.P., or us and any issuance of additional equity
    securities may adversely effect the market price of our stock
    and could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s
    investment.

Earnings,
    cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the
    price of our stock.

As a real estate investment trust, the market value of our
    equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the
    market’s perception of our growth potential and our current
    and potential future earnings and cash dividends. The market
    value of our equity securities is based secondarily upon the
    market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this
    reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher
    or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that
    we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working
    capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while
    increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not
    correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our
    failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to
    future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect
    the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield
    on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock)
    relative to market interest rates may also influence the price
    of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead
    prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher
    distribution yield, which would adversely affect our
    stock’s market price. Additionally, if the market price of
    our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain
    covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could
    adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future
    acquisitions and our ability to pay cash dividends to our
    stockholders.

Our board of directors has decided to align our regular dividend
    payments with the projected taxable income from recurring
    operations alone. We may make special distributions going
    forward, as necessary, related to taxable income associated with
    any asset dispositions and gain activity. In the past, our board
    of directors has suspended dividends to our stockholders, and it
    is possible that they may do so again in the future, or decide
    to pay dividends in our own stock as provided for in the
    Internal Revenue Code.

We
    could change our investment and financing policies without a
    vote of stockholders.

Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our
    qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change
    is approved by our board of directors under certain
    circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment
    and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt,
    capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Our board
    of directors may revise or amend these strategies and policies
    at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may
    not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely
    affect our financial condition or results of operations,
    including our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders.

Shares
    available for future sale could adversely affect the market
    price of our common stock.

The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had
    3,439,522 common limited partnership units issued and
    outstanding as of December 31, 2008, all of which are
    currently exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares of our
    common stock. In the future, the operating partnership or AMB
    Property II, L.P. may issue additional limited



partnership units, and we may issue shares of common stock, in
    connection with the acquisition of properties or in private
    placements. These shares of common stock and the shares of
    common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units
    may be sold in the public securities markets over time, pursuant
    to registration rights that we have granted, or may grant in
    connection with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144
    under the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, common stock
    issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be
    sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we
    have filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31,
    2008, under our stock option and incentive plans, we had
    8,447,215 shares of common stock reserved and available for
    future issuance, had outstanding options to purchase
    6,206,678 shares of common stock (of which 5,161,609 are
    vested and exercisable and 178,890 have exercise prices below
    market value at December 31, 2008) and had 859,026
    unvested restricted shares of common stock outstanding. Future
    sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in
    the market or the perception that such sales might occur could
    adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further,
    the existence of the common limited partnership units of the
    operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. and the shares
    of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of
    limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and
    registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the
    terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital
    through the sale of equity securities.

Risks
    Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our
    business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in
    our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over
    financial reporting.

The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
    procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not
    prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While
    management will continue to review the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
    financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal
    control over financial reporting will be effective in
    accomplishing all control objectives all of the time.
    Furthermore, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
    control over financial reporting with respect to entities that
    we do not control or manage or third-party entities that we may
    acquire may be substantially more limited than those we maintain
    with respect to the subsidiaries that we have controlled or
    managed over the course of time. Deficiencies, including any
    material weakness, in our internal control over financial
    reporting which may occur in the future could result in
    misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our
    financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise
    materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of
    operations, financial condition or liquidity.

INDUSTRIAL
    PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2008, we owned and managed 1,116
    industrial buildings aggregating approximately
    131.5 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated
    basis, we had 696 industrial buildings aggregating approximately
    72.8 million rentable square feet), excluding development
    and renovation projects and recently completed development
    projects available for sale or contribution, located in 49
    global markets throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our
    industrial properties were 95.1% leased to 2,602 customers, the
    largest of which accounted for no more than 4.1% of our
    annualized base rent from our industrial properties. See
    Part IV, Item 15: Note 16 of “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for segment information
    related to our operations.

Property Characteristics.

Our industrial
    properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution
    facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are
    typically comprised of multiple buildings.

Lease Terms.

Our industrial properties are
    typically subject to leases on a “triple net basis,”
    in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate
    taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject to leases
    on a “modified gross basis,” in which customers pay
    expenses over certain threshold levels. In addition, most of our
    leases include fixed rental increases or Consumer Price
    Index-based rental increases. Lease terms typically range from
    three to ten years, with a weighted average of six years,
    excluding renewal options. However, the majority of our
    industrial leases do not include renewal options.

Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are
    generally concentrated in locations with limited new
    construction opportunities within established, relatively large
    submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of
    occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere.
    These infill locations are typically near major airports or
    seaports or convenient to major highway systems and rail lines,
    and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is
    typically broad demand for industrial space in these
    centrally-located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries
    and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution,
    light assembly and manufacturing. We generally avoid locations
    at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are fewer
    constraints to the supply of additional industrial properties.

Consolidated
    Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2008, we held interests in co-investment
    ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with
    institutional investors and other third parties, which we
    consolidate in our financial statements. We determine
    consolidation based on standards set forth in FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB
    No. 51

(FIN 46) or EITF Issue

No. 04-5

(EITF 04-5),

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

and

SOP 78-9,

Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures.

Based
    on the guidance set forth in

EITF 04-5,

we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we
    exercise significant control over major operating decisions,
    such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers,
    asset management, investment activity and changes in financing.
    We are the general partner (or equivalent of a general partner
    in entities not structured as partnerships) in a number of our
    consolidated joint venture investments. In all such cases, the
    limited partners in such investments (or equivalent of limited
    partners in such investments which are not structured as
    partnerships) do not have rights described in

EITF 04-5,

which would preclude consolidation. We consolidate certain other
    joint ventures where we are not the general partner (or
    equivalent of a general partner in entities not structured as
    partnerships) because we have control over those entities
    through majority ownership, retention of the majority of
    economics, and a combination of substantive kick-out rights

and/or

substantive participating rights.

Under the agreements governing the co-investment ventures, we
    and the other party to the co-investment venture may be required
    to make additional capital contributions and, subject to certain
    limitations, the co-investment ventures may incur additional
    debt. Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the
    transfer of co-investment venture interests by us or the other
    party to the co-investment venture and typically provide certain
    rights to us or the other party to the co-investment venture to
    sell our or their interest in the co-investment venture to the
    co-investment venture or to the other co-investment venture
    partner on terms specified in the agreement. In addition, under
    certain circumstances, many of the co-investment ventures
    include buy/sell provisions. See Part IV, Item 15:
    Notes 9 and 10 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for additional details.

SOP 78-9,

Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures.

For
    joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined
    under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiary, we
    do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting
    purposes. For joint ventures under

EITF 04-5

where we do not exercise significant control over major
    operating and management decisions, but where we exercise
    significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting
    and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting
    purposes. In such unconsolidated joint ventures, either we are
    not the general partner (or general partner equivalent) and do
    not hold sufficient capital or any rights that would require
    consolidation or, alternatively, we are the general partner (or
    the general partner equivalent) and the other partners (or
    equivalent) hold substantive participating rights that override
    the presumption of control.

On December 30, 2004, we formed AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, a
    co-investment venture with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte. Ltd., a
    subsidiary of GIC Real Estate Pte. Ltd., the real estate
    investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment
    Corporation, in which we retained an approximate 20% interest.
    This interest increased to approximately 22% upon our
    acquisition of AMB Property Mexico. During 2008, we contributed
    three completed development projects totaling approximately
    1.4 million square feet to this co-investment venture for
    approximately $90.5 million. During 2007, we contributed
    one approximately 0.1 million square foot operating
    property for approximately $4.6 million to this
    co-investment venture. In addition, we recognized development
    profits from the contribution to this co-investment venture of
    two completed development projects aggregating approximately
    0.3 million square feet with a contribution value of
    $22.9 million.

On June 30, 2005, we formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., a
    co-investment venture with 13 institutional investors, in which
    we retained an approximate 20% interest. The 13 institutional
    investors have committed 49.5 billion Yen (approximately
    $545.9 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange
    rate at December 31, 2008) for an approximate 80%
    equity interest. During 2008, we contributed to this
    co-investment venture two completed development projects,
    aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for
    approximately $174.9 million (using the exchange rate on
    the date of contribution). During 2007, we contributed to this
    co-investment venture one completed development project
    aggregating approximately 0.5 million square feet for
    approximately $84.4 million (using the exchange rate on the
    date of contribution).

On October 17, 2006, we formed AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, a
    merchant development co-investment venture with GE Real Estate
    (“GE”), in which we retained an approximate 15%
    interest. The co-investment venture has total investment
    capacity of approximately $500.0 million to pursue
    development-for-sale opportunities primarily in
    U.S. markets other than those we identify as our target
    markets. GE and we have committed $425.0 million and
    $75.0 million of equity, respectively. No properties were
    contributed to this co-investment venture during 2008. During
    the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed to this
    co-investment venture approximately 82 acres of land with a
    contribution value of approximately $30.3 million.

Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended
    co-investment partnership formed in 2004 with institutional
    investors, on a prospective basis, due to the re-evaluation of
    our accounting for our investment because of changes to the
    partnership agreement regarding the general partner’s
    rights effective October 1, 2006. On July 1, 2008, the
    partners of AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated
    co-investment venture) contributed their interests in AMB
    Partners II, L.P. to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. in exchange for interests in AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture.
    During 2008, we contributed to this co-investment venture one
    approximately 0.8 million square foot operating property
    and four completed development projects, aggregating
    approximately 2.7 million square feet, for approximately
    $274.3 million. During 2007, we contributed to this
    co-investment venture one approximately 0.2 million square
    foot operating property and four completed development projects,
    aggregating approximately 1.0 million square feet for
    approximately $116.6 million.

On June 12, 2007, we formed AMB Europe Fund I,
    FCP-FIS, a Euro-denominated open-ended co-investment venture
    with institutional investors, in which we retained an
    approximate 20% interest upon formation. At the time of
    formation, the institutional investors committed approximately
    263.0 million Euros (approximately $367.5 million in
    U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31,
    2008) for an approximate 80% equity interest. During 2008,
    we contributed to this co-investment venture two development
    projects, aggregating approximately



0.2 million square feet, for approximately
    $35.2 million (using the exchange rate on the date of
    contribution). During 2007, we contributed approximately
    4.2 million square feet of operating properties and
    approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed
    development projects to this co-investment venture for
    approximately $799.3 million (using the exchange rates on
    the dates of contribution).

During 2008, we recognized gains from the contribution of real
    estate interests, net, of approximately $20.0 million,
    representing the portion of our interest in the contributed
    properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash, as a
    result of the contribution of approximately 0.8 million
    square feet of operating properties to AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P. These gains are presented in gains
    from sale or contribution of real estate interests, in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

During 2008, we recognized development profits of approximately
    $73.9 million, as a result of the contribution 11 completed
    development projects, aggregating approximately 5.2 million
    square feet, to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.,
    AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. and
    AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. During 2007, we recognized development
    profits of approximately $95.7 million, as a result of the
    contribution of 15 completed development projects and
    two land parcels, aggregating approximately 82 acres
    of land, to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB-SGP Mexico,
    LLC, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB DFS
    Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P.

Under the agreements governing the co-investment ventures, we
    and the other parties to the co-investment ventures may be
    required to make additional capital contributions and, subject
    to certain limitations, the co-investment ventures may incur
    additional debt.

AMB Pier One, LLC, is a joint venture related to the 2000
    redevelopment of the pier which holds our global headquarters in
    San Francisco, California. On June 30, 2007, we
    exercised our option to purchase the remaining equity interest
    from an unrelated third party, based on the fair market value as
    stipulated in the joint venture agreement in AMB Pier One, LLC,
    for a nominal amount. As a result, the investment was
    consolidated as of June 30, 2007.

In August 2008, a subsidiary of ours sold its approximate 5%
    interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund, a Canadian
    income trust specializing in aviation-related real estate at
    Canada’s international airports, as part of a tender offer
    for interests in the income trust. This equity investment of
    approximately $2.1 million (valued as of December 31,
    2007) was included in other assets on the consolidated
    balance sheets as of December 31, 2007.

Secured
    Debt

As of December 31, 2008, we had $1.5 billion of
    secured indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by
    deeds of trust or mortgages. As of December 31, 2008, the
    total gross investment book value of those properties securing
    the debt was $2.1 billion. Of the $1.5 billion of
    secured indebtedness, $808.1 million was consolidated
    co-investment venture debt secured by properties with a gross
    investment value of $1.4 billion. For additional details,
    see Part II, Item 7: “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and
    Part IV, Item 15: Note 6 of “Notes to

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations in
    conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Management’s
    Overview

Current
    Global Market and Economic Conditions

Recent global market and economic conditions have been
    unprecedented, challenging and unpredictable with significantly
    tighter credit and declining economic growth through the fourth
    quarter of 2008. Continued concerns about the availability and
    cost of credit, declining real estate market and geopolitical
    issues have contributed to increased market volatility and
    decreased expectations for the global economy. In the fourth
    quarter, added concerns fueled by the failure of several large
    financial institutions and government interventions in the
    U.S. financial system led to increased market uncertainty
    and instability in the global capital and credit markets. These
    conditions, combined with declining business activity levels and
    consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have contributed
    to unprecedented levels of volatility.

In light of this economic downturn, we are increasing our focus
    on our operations with a special emphasis on tenant retention
    and occupancy. Until the financial and real estate markets
    stabilize, we are limiting our acquisition and development
    activities to fulfilling prior commitments. We have realigned
    and streamlined internal resources as well as our overhead
    structure to meet the current and future needs of the business
    and have taken further steps to strengthen our capital and
    liquidity position. Our priorities are the strength of our
    balance sheet, controlling expenses and managing our business
    for the long term. Our goal is to do what we consider best for
    long-term value creation and enhancement of our net asset value.
    As we look forward, our objective is to emerge from this
    downturn in a competitive position to take advantage of
    opportunities as they arise, with our long term earnings
    capacity enhanced.

Primary
    sources of revenue and earnings

The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received
    from customers under long-term (generally three to ten years)
    operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements
    from customers for certain operating costs. We may also generate
    earnings from our private capital business, which consists of
    asset management fees and priority distributions, acquisition
    and development fees, and promote interests and incentive
    distributions from our co-investment ventures. Additionally, we
    may generate earnings from the contributions of development
    properties to our co-investment ventures, from the disposition
    of projects in our development-for-sale and value-added
    conversion programs and from land sales. We believe that our
    long-term growth will be driven by our ability to:

•

maintain and increase occupancy rates

and/or

increase rental rates at our properties;

•

raise third-party equity in our co-investment ventures and to
    grow our earnings from our private capital business from the
    acquisition of new properties or through the possible
    contribution of properties; and

•

develop properties profitably and sell to third parties or
    contribute to our select co-investment ventures.

Focus
    on our balance sheet and cost structure

To position ourselves to meet the challenges of the current
    business environment, we implemented a broad based cost
    reduction plan in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result, we
    recognized a restructuring charge of approximately
    $12.3 million in the quarter, associated with severance,
    office closures and the termination of certain contractual
    obligations. About one-third of the restructuring charges were
    non-cash. As part of this plan, we reduced our total global
    headcount by approximately 22% as well as certain forecasted
    third-party expenditures. In executing these cost saving
    efforts, we believe that we have preserved our ability to serve
    our global customers and manage our operating portfolio. While
    we have removed excess capacity in our deployment teams, we
    believe that we have retained our key talent and left our global
    platforms intact. Cost reductions were also made to the back



office, support functions and third party costs, particularly
    those that related to our global expansion efforts in India and
    Poland.

During the fourth quarter, we suspended our regular quarterly
    common stock dividend as we had met our 2008 REIT dividend
    distribution requirement. In addition, we aligned our 2009
    regular quarterly dividend payments with the projected taxable
    income from recurring operations alone. Together, we believe
    these actions will improve our cash position by allowing us to
    retain $53.0 million of cash in the fourth quarter of 2008
    and an additional $98 million over the course of 2009. We
    may make special distributions going forward, as necessary,
    related to taxable income associated with any asset dispositions
    and gain activity.

We are currently exploring various options to monetize some of
    our development and operating assets, including asset sales and
    the formation of new joint ventures. On an owned and managed
    basis, we have properties available for sale or contribution
    with an estimated total investment upon completion of
    $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2008. We may use some
    or all of the proceeds from these transactions to decrease our
    debt obligations, but there can be no assurance that we will
    consummate any such transactions or use the proceeds to pay our
    debt obligations.

Our
    liquidity position

As a result of the current market conditions, the cost and
    availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely
    affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads.
    Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the
    strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and
    institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to
    provide funding to businesses and consumers. We believe our
    current maturity schedule is well-laddered. As of
    December 31, 2008, our total consolidated debt maturities
    for 2009 were $782.6 million, excluding principal
    amortization. Assuming that we exercise available extension
    options, our total 2009 consolidated debt maturities would be
    $340.7 million, excluding principal amortization. Our total
    unconsolidated debt maturities for 2009 were $212.1 million
    as of December 31, 2008, excluding principal amortization.
    Assuming we exercise available extension options, our total 2009
    unconsolidated debt maturities would be $173.4 million,
    excluding principal amortization. As of December 31, 2008,
    we had $710.2 million available for future borrowings under
    our three multi-currency lines of credit and had cash and cash
    equivalents of $223.9 million. While we believe that we
    have sufficient working capital and capacity under our credit
    facilities to continue our business operations as usual in the
    near-term, continued turbulence in the global markets and
    economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer
    spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial
    condition, as well as the liquidity and financial condition of
    our customers. If these market conditions persist in the
    long-term, they may limit our ability, and the ability of our
    customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the
    capital markets to meet liquidity needs.

If the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall
    below current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under our
    unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans may increase.
    In addition, if the long-term debt ratings of the operating
    partnership fall below investment grade, we may be unable to
    request borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or
    Japanese Yen, as applicable. However, the lack of other currency
    borrowings does not affect our ability to fully draw down under
    the credit facilities or term loans. While we currently do not
    expect the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership
    to fall below investment grade, in the event that the ratings do
    fall below those levels, we may be unable to exercise our
    options to extend the term of our credit facilities or our
    $230.0 million secured term loan credit agreement, and the
    loss of our ability to borrow in foreign currencies could affect
    our ability to optimally hedge our borrowings against foreign
    currency exchange rate changes. In addition, based on publicly
    available information regarding our lenders, we currently do not
    expect to lose borrowing capacity under our existing lines of
    credit and as a result of a dissolution, bankruptcy,
    consolidation, merger or other business combination among our
    lenders. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is
    dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such
    facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. If we do not
    have sufficient cash flows and income from our operations to
    meet our financial commitments and lenders are not able to meet
    their funding commitments to us, our business, results of
    operations, cash flows and financial condition could be
    adversely affected.

Certain of our third party indebtedness is held by our
    consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures. In the event that
    our joint venture partner is unable to meet its obligations
    under our joint venture agreements or the third



party debt agreements, we may elect to pay our joint venture
    partner’s portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the
    mortgaged property or permit the lender to foreclose on the
    mortgaged property to meet the joint venture’s debt
    obligations. In either case, we would face a loss of income and
    asset value on the property.

In addition, a continued increase in the cost of credit and
    inability to access the capital and credit markets may adversely
    impact the occupancy of our properties, the disposition of our
    properties, private capital raising and contribution of
    properties to our co-investment ventures. If we are unable to
    contribute completed development properties to our co-investment
    ventures or sell our completed development projects to third
    parties, we will not be able to recognize gains from the
    contribution or sale of such properties and, as a result, our
    net income available to our common stockholders and our funds
    from operations will decrease. Additionally, business layoffs,
    downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that
    affect our customers may adversely impact our business and
    financial condition. Furthermore, general uncertainty in the
    real estate markets has resulted in conditions where the pricing
    of certain real estate assets may be difficult due to
    uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and valuations,
    among other things, which may add to the difficulty of buyers or
    our co-investment ventures to obtain financing on favorable
    terms to acquire such properties or cause potential buyers to
    not complete acquisitions of such properties. The market
    uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and real estate
    valuations also adversely impacts our net asset value.

In the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us
    through our operations to continue operating our business as
    usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our
    liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation,
    divesting ourselves of properties, whether or not they otherwise
    meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term, at less
    than optimal terms; issuing and selling our debt and equity in
    public or private transactions under less than optimal
    conditions; entering into leases with our customers at lower
    rental rates or less than optimal terms; or entering into lease
    renewals with our existing customers without an increase in
    rental rates at turnover. There can be no assurance, however,
    that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be
    available to us. Additionally, taking such measures to increase
    our liquidity may adversely affect our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.

Our main financial covenants with respect to our credit
    facilities generally relate to fixed charge or debt service
    coverage, liabilities to asset value, debt to asset value and
    unencumbered cash flow. As of December 31, 2008, we were in
    compliance with all of these covenants. There can be no
    assurance, however, that if the financial markets and economic
    conditions continue to deteriorate, that we will be able to
    continue to comply with our financial covenants.

Impairment
    and restructuring charges

We recognized charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to
    the valuation of our development program and reduction in
    personnel of approximately $219.5 million on an owned and
    managed basis ($218.0 million on a consolidated basis);
    these charges were almost entirely non-cash. The impairment
    charge on the assets under development and those available for
    sale or contribution on an owned or managed basis totaled
    approximately $100.7 million ($99.2 million on a
    consolidated basis), reflecting a 16% decline from the
    $617.4 million cost basis of the assets written down. The
    majority of the impairment charges related to assets in the
    Americas, with the remainder primarily in Europe. The impairment
    charge on the land inventory totaled approximately
    $94.7 million, reflecting a 34% decline from the
    $278.9 million cost basis of the land written down. These
    impairments were related to land inventory in the Americas. We
    also incurred approximately $11.8 million in charges for
    the write-off of pursuit costs related to development projects
    that we no longer plan to commence and reserves against tax
    assets associated with the reduction in development activity, as
    well as approximately $12.3 million of restructuring
    charges associated with severance, office closures and the
    termination of certain contractual obligations.

An impairment charge is recognized when the book value of a
    property or land parcel is greater than its estimated fair
    value, based on the intended use and holding period. The
    intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the
    long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured.
    If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is determined
    using the estimated fair value. If an asset is intended to be
    held for the long term, impairment is recognized if undiscounted
    cash flows over the entire holding period, including a residual
    value, are less than the cost basis. We determined impairment
    based upon estimated fair market values which are consistent



with our business model to sell or contribute the assets we
    develop. When available, current market information was used to
    determine capitalization and rental growth rates. When market
    information was not readily available, the inputs were based on
    our understanding of market conditions and the experience of the
    management team, although actual results could differ
    significantly from our estimates. In a few instances, current
    comparative sales values were available and used to establish
    fair value. Additional impairments may be necessary in the
    future in the event that market conditions continue to
    deteriorate and impact the factors used to estimate fair value.
    We also utilized the knowledge of our regional teams and the
    recent valuations of our two open-ended funds, which contain a
    large, geographically-diversified pool of assets, all of which
    were subject to third-party appraisals at year end.

In order to comply with disclosure requirements as outlined in
    SFAS No. 157, the designation of the level of inputs
    used in the fair value models must be determined. Inputs used in
    establishing fair value for real estate assets generally fall
    within level three, which are characterized as requiring
    significant judgment as little or no current market activity may
    be available for validation. The main indicator used to
    establish the classification of the inputs was current market
    conditions that, in many instances, resulted in the use of
    significant unobservable inputs in establishing fair value
    measurements. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 3 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses
    recorded in our results of operations during the fourth quarter
    of 2008.

Market
    price of our shares

Recent global financial market and economic conditions have
    adversely impacted the market price per share of our common
    stock. Our market equity was $2.39 billion as of
    December 31, 2008, compared to $5.94 billion as of
    December 31, 2007. We define market equity as the total
    number of outstanding shares of our common stock and common
    limited partnership units multiplied by the closing price per
    share of our common stock at the relevant period end. The
    factors impacting the price per share of our common stock are
    discussed under the heading “Business Risks” in
    Part I, Item 1A of this report.

Customer
    bankruptcies

From a customer receivables standpoint, as of December 31,
    2008, we believe that account receivables delinquency levels
    were consistent with our historical norms and we believe that we
    maintain adequate bad debt reserves. Although we believe that
    the number of bankruptcies of our customers increased during the
    fourth quarter of 2008, we believe the impact of such
    bankruptcies on our business was not significant for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. Our account receivables
    delinquencies may not continue at the same levels, our bad debt
    reserves may not be sufficient to cover such delinquencies as
    they occur and the level of customer bankruptcies may increase
    to levels that could be significant to our operations.

Real
    estate operations

Real estate fundamentals in the United States continued to
    weaken in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the national economy
    slowed further. We anticipate that the U.S. and global
    economies will decline further in 2009. Customer decision-making
    is prolonged, as commitments for new space are being eliminated
    or put on hold with only time critical leasing decisions being
    made. According to data provided by Torto Wheaton Research as of
    February 19, 2009, availability in the United States was
    11.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, up
    70 basis points from the prior quarter and 200 basis
    points from the fourth quarter of 2007. Also, according to Torto
    Wheaton Research, absorption was negative 47.1 million
    square feet in the fourth quarter of 2008, and construction
    completions were 44.5 million square feet, down from
    45.6 million square feet in the prior quarter. For 2008,
    absorption was negative 94.1 million square feet, the
    lowest since 2001. While we expect the delivery pipeline to
    decline substantially, we expect net absorption to be negative
    in 2009.

We believe the strongest industrial markets in the United States
    continue to be the primary infill coastal markets tied to global
    trade. While demand has weakened notably across the U.S., due
    primarily to the weakening economy, we believe our coastal
    markets will continue to outperform other U.S. industrial
    markets. Outside the United States, while activity is
    moderating, we believe that we will continue to experience
    demand for our



distribution facilities due to the reconfiguration of supply
    chains and customer requirements for upgraded distribution space
    to modern facilities.

Although the economy continued to slow, we maintained strong
    occupancy levels at December 31, 2008 compared to
    September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Our owned
    and managed portfolio occupancy at December 31, 2008 was
    95.1%, down from 95.4% at September 30, 2008 and 96.0% at
    December 31, 2007, while average occupancy was 94.9%, down
    from 95.0% at September 30, 2008 and 95.1% at
    December 31, 2007. During the three months ended
    December 31, 2008, rent on renewed and re-leased space in
    our operating portfolio increased 2.5% on an owned and managed
    basis, excluding expense reimbursements, rental abatements,
    percentage rents and straight-line rents. Rental rates on lease
    renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 3.1% for the
    trailing four quarters ended December 31, 2008. During
    2008, cash-basis same store net operating income, with and
    without the effect of lease termination fees, grew by 4.0% and
    0.2%, respectively, on an owned and managed basis. Excluding the
    impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements against the
    U.S. dollar, cash-basis same store net operating income
    without the effect of lease termination fees increased 2.3%
    during the year ended



December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, cash-basis
    same store net operating income, with and without the effect of
    lease termination fees, increased by 4.4% and 3.7%,
    respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See
    “Supplemental Earnings Measures” for a discussion of
    cash-basis same store net operating income and a reconciliation
    of cash-basis same store net operating income and net income.

Development
    Business

Our development business consists of conventional development,
    build-to-suit development, redevelopment, value-added
    conversions and land sales. We generate earnings from our
    development business through the disposition or contribution of
    projects from these activities.

Despite the cyclical downturn in the U.S. and global
    economies, we believe that, over the long term, customer demand
    for new industrial space in strategic markets tied to global
    trade will continue to outpace supply, most notably in major
    gateway markets in Asia and Europe. To capitalize on this
    demand, we intend to opportunistically develop in many of our
    global markets that are essential to global trade. However,
    given the uncertainty in the global economy, we curtailed
    development activity, and as a result, development starts for
    the full year decreased 50% over 2007 with 69% of our 2008
    development starts outside the United States. For 2009, our
    development activity will be limited to fulfilling prior
    commitments until the financial and real estate markets
    stabilize. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we
    hold a total of 2,503 acres of land for future development
    or sale, approximately 86% of which is located in North America,
    including 79 acres that are held in an unconsolidated joint
    venture. We currently estimate that these 2,503 acres of
    land could support approximately 45.1 million square feet
    of future development. Our long-term capital allocation goal is
    to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating
    portfolio invested in

non-U.S. markets

based on annualized base rent.

We believe that our historical investment focus on industrial
    real estate in some of the world’s most strategic infill
    markets positions us to create value through the select
    conversion of industrial properties to higher and better uses
    (value-added conversions). Generally, we expect to sell to third
    parties these value-added conversion projects at some point in
    the re-entitlement/conversion process, thus recognizing the
    enhanced value of the underlying land that supports the
    property’s repurposed use. Value-added conversions involve
    the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better
    use, including office, residential, retail, research &
    development or manufacturing. Activities required to prepare the
    property for conversion to a higher and better use may include
    such activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and
    retenanting. The sales price of a value-added conversion project
    is generally based on the underlying land value, reflecting its
    ultimate higher and better use and as such, little to no
    residual value is ascribed to the industrial building. Due to
    dislocation in the housing industry, we do not believe that this
    is the optimal time to market certain value-added conversion
    projects, in particular, those intended to include a residential
    component. We remain committed to the viability of this
    development activity and believe that a well-timed approach to
    executing value-added conversion transactions will enhance
    stockholder value over the long term.

Private
    Capital Business

Since our initial public offering in 1997, we have formed eleven
    co-investment ventures and raised approximately
    $3.1 billion of private capital from third parties as
    equity in such co-investment ventures. Eight of these
    co-investment ventures are still active in the United States,
    Mexico, Europe and Japan: AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P., AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB Japan
    Fund I, L.P., AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB DFS Fund I,
    LLC, AMB-SGP, L.P., AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II,
    L.P., and

AMB-AMS,

L.P.

We believe that our co-investment program with private-capital
    investors will continue to serve as a source of revenues and
    capital for new investments. Through these co-investment
    ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management
    fees and priority distributions, as well as promote interests
    and incentive distributions based on the performance of the
    co-investment ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we
    will continue to do so. Through contribution of development
    properties to our co-investment ventures, we expect to recognize
    value creation from our development pipeline. In anticipation of
    the formation of future co-investment ventures, we may also hold
    acquired and newly developed properties for contribution to such
    future co-investment ventures.



Equityholders in two of our co-investment ventures, AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, have a right to request that the ventures
    redeem their interests under certain conditions. The redemption
    right of investors in AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. is currently exercisable, and as of December 31, 2008,
    this co-investment venture had $132.7 million of
    outstanding redemption requests based on the co-investment
    venture’s net asset value at December 31, 2008. The
    redemption right of investors in AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS
    is exercisable beginning after July 1, 2011. Although such
    redemption rights generally do not require the co-investment
    ventures to allocate newly acquired capital to cover redemption
    activity, there can be no assurance that such allocation will
    not occur and will not occur in such magnitude that will affect
    our contribution of properties to the ventures. While we have no
    obligation to fund redemption requests, we plan to meet our
    redemptions as cash becomes available through property sales,
    financings and new capital contributions.

As of December 31, 2008, we owned approximately
    78.7 million square feet of our properties (49.2% of the
    total operating and development portfolio) through our
    consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We may
    make additional investments through these co-investment ventures
    or new co-investment ventures in the future and presently plan
    to do so. Given the current economic environment, however, the
    pace of new private capital commitments has slowed significantly.

    contributed their interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. to AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., in exchange for
    interests in AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. At
    the contribution date, the outstanding balance of the
    $65.0 million non-recourse credit facility obtained by AMB
    Partners II, L.P. was repaid in full and the facility was
    terminated. Additionally, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P., assumed $314.4 million of secured debt with a
    weighted average interest rate of 6.1%; and

•

Obtained a $230.0 million secured term loan facility, which
    had a balance of $230.0 million outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008, and a weighted average interest rate of
    4.0%.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
    of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements,
    which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The
    preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our
    assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our
    estimates on historical experience and on various other
    assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
    judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
    that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions. We believe the following critical accounting
    policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates
    used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless
    circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which
    case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is
    made to reduce it to its estimated fair value. We also regularly
    review the impact of above or below-market leases, in-place
    leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions, and record
    an intangible asset or liability accordingly.

Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed
    for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    When the carrying value of a property or land parcel is greater
    than its estimated fair value, based on the intended use and
    holding period, an impairment charge to earnings is recognized
    for the excess over its estimated fair value less costs to sell.
    The intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for
    the long term, can significantly impact how impairment is
    measured. If an asset is intended to be held for the long term,
    the impairment



analysis is based on a two-step test. The first test measures
    estimated expected future cash flows over the holding period,
    including a residual value (undiscounted and without interest
    charges), against the carrying value of the property. If the
    asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is measured
    against the lower of cost or the present value of expected cash
    flows over the expected hold period. An impairment charge to
    earnings is recognized for the excess of the asset’s
    carrying value over the lower of cost or the present values of
    expected cash flows over the expected hold period. If an asset
    is intended to be sold, impairment is determined using the
    estimated fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of
    expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and
    relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and
    market conditions and the availability of capital. We determine
    the estimated fair values based on our assumptions regarding
    rental rates, costs to complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values.
    When available, current market information was used to determine
    capitalization and rental growth rates. When market information
    was not readily available, the inputs were based on our
    understanding of market conditions and the experience of the
    management team. Actual results could differ significantly from
    our estimates. The discount rates used in the fair value
    estimates ranged from 8-11% and represent a rate commensurate
    with the indicated holding period with a premium layered on for
    risk. In a few instances, current comparative sales values were
    available and used to establish fair value. We also utilize the
    knowledge of our regional teams and the recent valuations of our
    two open-ended funds, which contain a large, geographically
    diversified pool of assets, all of which are subject to
    third-party appraisals at year end.

Revenue Recognition.

We record rental revenue
    from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of
    the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that
    may result from the inability of our customers to make required
    payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments
    that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts,
    security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to
    recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods.
    We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers
    on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial condition
    periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our
    outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents,
    for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also
    record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a
    definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the
    termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be
    met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains
    in the leased space following the execution of a definitive
    termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are
    deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s
    occupancy.

Property Dispositions.

We report real estate
    dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated
    statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our
    interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the
    sale represent the interests acquired by third-party investors
    for cash and are included in gains from sale or contribution of
    real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we
    dispose of value-added conversion projects and build-to-suit and
    speculative development projects for which we have not generated
    material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss
    recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported
    net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are included in
    development profits, net of taxes, within continuing operations
    of the statement of operations. Third, we dispose of value-added
    conversion and other redevelopment projects for which we may
    have generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain
    or loss recognized is reported net of estimated taxes, when
    applicable, in the development gains line within discontinued
    operations. Lastly, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

requires us to separately
    report as discontinued operations the historical operating
    results attributable to operating properties sold and the
    applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties,
    which is included in development gains and gains from
    dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and minority
    interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated
    statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to
    conform with this classification. There is no impact on our
    previously reported consolidated financial position, net income
    or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized
    using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to
    transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full
    accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when
    the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met.

Joint Ventures.

We hold interests in both
    consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine
    consolidation based on standards set forth in FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB
    No. 51

(FIN 46) or EITF Issue

No. 04-5

(EITF 04-5),

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the



Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

and

SOP 78-9,

Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures.

For
    joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined
    under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiary, we
    do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting
    purposes. Based on the guidance set forth in

EITF 04-5,

we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we
    exercise significant control over major operating decisions,
    such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers,
    asset management, investment activity and changes in financing.
    We are the general partner (or equivalent of a general partner
    in entities not structured as partnerships) in a number of our
    consolidated joint venture investments. In all such cases, the
    limited partners in such investments (or equivalent of limited
    partners in such investments which are not structured as
    partnerships) do not have rights described in

EITF 04-5,

which would preclude consolidation. We consolidate certain other
    joint ventures where we are not the general partner (or
    equivalent of a general partner in entities not structured as
    partnerships) because we have control over those entities
    through majority ownership, retention of the majority of
    economics, and a combination of substantive kick-out rights

and/or

substantive participating rights. For joint ventures under

EITF 04-5

where we do not exercise significant control over major
    operating and management decisions, but where we exercise
    significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting
    and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting
    purposes. In such unconsolidated joint ventures, either we are
    not the general partner (or general partner equivalent) and do
    not hold sufficient capital or any rights that would require
    consolidation or, alternatively, we are the general partner (or
    the general partner equivalent) and the other partners (or
    equivalent) hold substantive participating rights that override
    the presumption of control.

Based on the guidance set forth in

EITF 04-5,

we consolidate certain co-investment venture investments because
    we exercise significant control over major operating decisions,
    such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers,
    asset management, investment activity and changes in financing.
    For co-investment ventures under

EITF 04-5,

where we do not exercise significant control over major
    operating and management decisions, but where we exercise
    significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting
    and do not consolidate the co-investment venture for financial
    reporting purposes.

Capitalized General and Administrative
    Expenses.

In conformity with
    SFAS No. 67,

Accounting for Costs and Initial
    Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects

, we capitalize
    costs, such as general and administrative expenses that are
    directly related to our development projects, based on time
    spent on development activities.

Real Estate Investment Trust.

As a real estate
    investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate
    level federal income taxes in the United States if we meet
    minimum distribution requirements, and certain income, asset and
    share ownership tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be
    subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign
    entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country.
    An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our
    taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment
    trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax
    component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus
    tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition.
    However, we believe the net deferred tax is an immaterial
    component of our consolidated balance sheet.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and
    Translation.

Transactions that require the
    remeasurement and translation of a foreign currency are recorded
    according to the guidance set forth in SFAS No. 52,

Foreign Currency Translation

. The U.S. dollar is the
    functional currency for our subsidiaries formed in the United
    States, Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. Other than
    Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe, the functional
    currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United
    States is generally the local currency of the country in which
    the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of
    currency exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose
    functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their
    financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and
    liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of
    the financial statement date. We translate income statement
    accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and
    significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the
    transaction date.

Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated
    in currencies other than their functional currencies. In these
    instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at
    the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities
    are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the
    period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the
    average exchange rate for the period. We also record gains or
    losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third
    party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s
    functional



currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows
    realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange
    rate in effect when the transaction was initiated.

CONSOLIDATED
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store
    growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. The
    same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the
    end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and
    excludes development properties stabilized after
    December 31, 2006 (generally defined as properties that are
    90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete
    for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2008, the
    same store industrial pool consisted of properties aggregating
    approximately 65.0 million square feet. Our future
    financial condition and results of operations, including rental
    revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional
    properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses
    may vary materially from historical results.

U.S. industrial same store rental revenues decreased
    $35.4 million from the prior year primarily due to the
    decrease of $40.6 million in same store revenues from the
    contribution of the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P.
    (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated
    co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store rental
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have
    been $574.7 million if the interests in AMB Partners II,
    L.P. had not been contributed as of December 31, 2008. The
    decrease of $40.6 million related to the contribution of
    interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. was offset by an
    increase of $5.2 million, primarily due to increased rates
    and decreases in free rent. The increase in rental revenues from
    development of $0.5 million was primarily due to increased
    occupancy at several of our development projects. Other
    industrial revenues include rental revenues from development
    projects that have reached certain levels of operation but are
    not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The
    increase in these revenues of



$8.1 million reflects the number of projects that have
    reached these levels of operation and higher rent levels during
    2008. The increase in revenues from

non-U.S. industrial

properties of $32.7 million was primarily due to the
    acquisition of 2.4 million square feet of operating
    properties during 2008 as well as an increase in square footage
    leased at our completed development properties. The increase in
    private capital revenues of $36.7 million was primarily due
    to the receipt of an incentive distribution of
    $33.0 million for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P., an incentive distribution of $1.0 million in
    connection with the sale of the partnership interests in
    AMB/Erie, L.P., including its final real estate asset to AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and an increase in
    asset management fees as a result of an increase in total
    unconsolidated assets under management, partially offset by a
    decrease in acquisition fees.

Same store properties’ operating expenses decreased
    $14.0 million from the prior year primarily due to a
    decrease of $10.5 million from the contribution of the
    interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated
    co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on
    July 1, 2008. The decrease of $3.5 million, excluding
    the effect of the AMB Partners II, L.P. contribution, was
    primarily due to decreased repairs and maintenance expense as
    well as decreases in real estate taxes and insurance expense.
    Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested
    properties that have been contributed to unconsolidated
    co-investment ventures, which are not classified as discontinued
    operations in our consolidated financial statements, and
    development properties that have reached certain levels of
    operation but are not yet part of the same store operating pool
    of properties. The decrease in these costs of $2.1 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due
    to the decrease in our development-start and acquisition
    activities. Development starts for the full year 2008 totaled
    $544.7 million, a 50 percent decrease from
    $1.1 billion in 2007. The decrease was partially offset by
    the contribution of one operating property totaling
    0.8 million square feet during 2008. The increase in
    property operating costs for

non-U.S. industrial

properties of $28.1 million was primarily due to the
    acquisition of 2.4 million square feet of operating
    properties during 2008, as well as an increase in square footage
    leased at our completed development properties. The increase in
    depreciation and amortization expense of $6.8 million was
    primarily due to the recognition of $4.3 million of
    depreciation expense resulting from



the reclassification of $76.7 million from properties held
    for contribution to investments in real estate. The increase in
    general and administrative expenses of $14.5 million was
    primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, resulting from
    increased employee headcount in the first three quarters of 2008
    as well as an increase in professional services, and taxes.
    During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded
    $12.3 million in restructuring charges due to the
    implementation of a broad-based cost reduction plan, which
    included a reduction in global headcount, office closure costs
    and the termination of certain contractual obligations. The
    increase in real estate impairment losses was primarily a result
    of changes in the economic environment in addition to the
    write-off of pursuit costs. See Part IV, Item 15:
    Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the real
    estate impairment losses recorded in our results of operations
    during the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in other
    expenses of $4.6 million was primarily due to a loss on our
    non-qualified deferred compensation plans during the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to a gain during the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Development profits represent gains from the sale or
    contribution of development projects including land. See the
    development sales and development contributions tables and
    “— Property Divestitures” in “Capital
    Resources” for a discussion of the development asset sales
    and contributions and the associated development profits during
    the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. During the year
    ended December 31, 2008, we contributed an operating
    property for approximately $66.2 million, aggregating
    approximately 0.8 million square feet, into AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. As a result, we
    recognized a gain of $20.0 million on the contribution,
    representing the portion of our interest in the contributed
    property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. During
    the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed
    4.2 million square feet in operating properties into AMB
    Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, contributed a 0.2 million
    square foot operating property into AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P., and contributed an operating property
    aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet into
    AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, for a total of approximately
    $524.9 million. As a result of these contributions, we
    recognized gains from the contribution of real estate interests
    of approximately $73.4 million, representing the portion of
    our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the
    third-party investors for cash.

The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint
    ventures of $9.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was primarily due to the contribution of
    the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a
    consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment
    venture, as well as growth in our unconsolidated assets under
    management. Other (expense) income decreased $25.4 million
    from the prior year primarily due to foreign currency exchange
    rate loss, a loss on our non qualified deferred compensation
    plan of $7.8 million, the recognition of a
    $5.5 million loss on impairment of an investment and a
    decrease in interest income of approximately $3.3 million,
    partially offset by an increase in third party management fees.
    During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a
    gain on currency remeasurement of approximately
    $3.1 million, compared to a loss of approximately
    $5.7 million in 2008. Additionally, other income during the
    year ended December 31, 2007 included insurance proceeds of
    approximately $2.9 million related to losses from
    Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Interest expense increased
    $6.6 million as result of increased total consolidated debt
    at December 31, 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold an
    approximate 0.1 million square foot industrial operating
    property for a sale price of $3.6 million, with a resulting
    net gain of $0.7 million, and also recognized a deferred
    gain of approximately $1.1 million on the divestiture of
    one industrial building, aggregating approximately
    0.1 million square feet, for a price of $3.5 million,
    which was disposed of on December 31, 2007. During the year
    ended December 31, 2007, we divested ourselves of three
    industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 0.3 million
    square feet, for an aggregate price of $120.0 million, with
    a resulting net gain of $2.0 million, and two value-added
    conversion projects resulting in a gain of approximately
    $60.0 million.

On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all
    800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 800,000
    of its outstanding 7.95% Series K Cumulative Redeemable
    Preferred Limited Partnership Units. In addition, AMB Property
    II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 510,000 of
    its outstanding 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable
    Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result of the
    redemptions and repurchase, we recognized a reduction of income
    available to common stockholders of $2.9 million for the
    original issuance costs during the year ended December 31,
    2007. No repurchases were made during the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective
    basis, due to the re-evaluation of the accounting for our
    investment in the fund because of changes to the partnership
    agreement regarding the general partner’s rights effective
    October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations
    presented below are not comparable between years presented.

U.S. industrial same store rental revenues decreased
    $26.0 million from the prior year due primarily to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P., on October 1, 2006. Same store rental revenues for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been
    $542.1 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The
    increase of $27.4 million, excluding the deconsolidation of
    AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., is primarily due
    to increased occupancy, rent increases on renewals and rollovers
    as well as decreases in free rent. The 2007 acquisitions
    consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately
    0.7 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues
    from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at
    several of our development projects where development activities
    have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the
    number of development projects. Other industrial revenues
    include rental revenues from properties that have been
    contributed to an unconsolidated co-investment venture, and
    accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our
    consolidated financial statements, and development projects that
    have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of
    the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in
    other industrial revenues was primarily due to an increase in
    base rents. The decrease in revenues from

non-U.S. industrial

properties was primarily due to the contribution of
    4.2 million square feet of operating properties and
    approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed
    development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS. The
    decrease in private capital income of $14.4 million was
    primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees, acquisition fees,
    and disposition fees offset by an increase in asset management
    fees as a result of an increase in total assets under management.

Same store properties’ operating expenses increased
    $4.0 million from the prior year, despite a decrease of
    approximately $12.7 million due to the deconsolidation of
    AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on
    October 1, 2006. Same store operating expenses for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 would have been $145.7 million
    if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been
    deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The increase of
    approximately $16.7 million, had AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. been deconsolidated as of January 1,
    2006, was primarily due to increased insurance costs, real
    estate taxes, roads and grounds expense, and management fees.
    The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating
    approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in
    development operating costs was primarily due to increased
    operations in certain development projects which have been
    substantially completed. This increase was primarily due to
    increases in real estate taxes and utilities. The increase in
    other industrial property operating costs was primarily due to
    insurance, cleaning and non-reimbursable expenses. The decrease
    in property operating costs from

non-U.S. industrial

properties is primarily due to the contribution of
    4.2 million square feet of operating properties and
    approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed
    development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS. The
    decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. The increase in general and administrative expenses was
    primarily due to additional staffing and the opening of new
    offices both domestically and internationally. The decrease of
    fund costs from the prior year was due primarily to the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. The impairment losses during the year ended
    December 31, 2007 were taken on non-core assets as a result
    of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment.
    The impairment losses during the year ended December 31,
    2006 were taken on several non-core assets as a result of
    leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and
    the holding period of certain assets. Other expenses increased
    approximately $2.5 million from the prior year due
    primarily to an increase in dead deal expenditures.

Development profits, net of taxes, represent gains from the sale
    or contribution of development projects including land. See the
    development sales and development contributions tables and
    “— Property Divestitures” in “Capital
    Resources” for a discussion of the development asset sales
    and contributions and the associated development profits during
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. During the year
    ended December 31, 2007, we contributed 4.2 million
    square feet in operating properties into AMB Europe Fund I,
    FCP-FIS, contributed a 0.2 million square foot operating
    property into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.,
    and contributed an operating property aggregating approximately
    0.1 million square feet into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, for a
    total of approximately $524.9 million. As a result of these
    contributions, we recognized gains from contribution of real
    estate interests of approximately $73.4 million,
    representing the portion of our interest in the contributed
    properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash. The
    decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures
    of approximately $15.8 million was primarily due to a
    decrease in gains from the sale of real estate interests by our
    unconsolidated joint ventures partially offset by the
    deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. Other income increased approximately $10.4 million
    from the prior year due primarily to an increase in the gain on
    currency remeasurement of approximately $3.9 million, an
    increase in insurance proceeds of approximately
    $2.9 million related to losses from Hurricanes Katrina and
    Wilma and an increase in interest income of $2.3 million.
    The decrease in interest expense, including amortization, was
    due primarily to decreased borrowings on unsecured credit
    facilities and the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P.

In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85%
    Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The
    increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the then newly
    issued shares. On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership
    redeemed all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and
    all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series K Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. In addition, on
    April 17, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our
    subsidiaries, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00%
    Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units. As a result of the redemptions and

    Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00%
    Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited
    Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in
    income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for
    the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Balance Sheet Strategy.

In general, we use
    unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and
    common equity (issued by us

and/or

the
    operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our
    wholly-owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non-recourse,
    secured debt encumbering our wholly-owned assets and replace
    that debt with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing
    the co-investment ventures, in general, we use non-recourse,
    secured debt to capitalize our co-investment ventures.

We currently expect that our principal sources of working
    capital and funding for debt service, development, acquisitions,
    expansion and renovation of properties will include:

•

cash on hand and cash flow from operations;

•

private capital from co-investment partners;

•

net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed
    development projects to our co-investment ventures;

•

net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value-added
    conversion projects and land to third parties;

•

net proceeds from divestitures of properties;

•

borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities;

•

other forms of secured or unsecured financing;

•

assumption of debt related to acquired properties;

•

proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including
    issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries); and

•

proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities
    offerings.

We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will
    include:

•

debt service;

•

development, expansion and renovation of properties;

•

acquisitions;

•

dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred
    stock and limited partnership units; and

•

working capital.



To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust,
    we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually
    at least 90% of our taxable income. While historically we have
    satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash
    distributions to our stockholders, we may choose to satisfy this
    requirement by making distributions of cash or other property,
    including, in limited circumstances, our own stock. As a result
    of this distribution requirement, we cannot rely on retained
    earnings to fund our on-going operations to the same extent that
    other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts
    can. We may need to continue to raise capital in both the debt
    and equity markets to fund our working capital needs,
    acquisitions and developments.

If the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall
    below its current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under our
    unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans will
    increase. In addition, if the long-term debt ratings of the
    operating partnership fall below investment grade, we may be
    unable to request borrowings in currencies other than
    U.S. dollars or Japanese Yen, as applicable, however, the
    lack of other currency borrowings does not affect our ability to
    fully draw down under the credit facilities or term loans. In
    the event the long-term debt ratings of the operating
    partnership fall below investment grade, we may be unable to
    exercise our options to extend the term of our credit facilities
    or our $230 million secured term loan credit agreement.
    However, our lenders will not be able to terminate our credit
    facilities or certain term loans in the event that the operating
    partnership’s credit rating falls below investment grade
    status. None of our credit facilities or such term loans
    contains covenants regarding our stock price or market
    capitalization, thus a decrease in our stock price is not
    expected to impact our ability to borrow under our existing
    lines of credit and term loans. Based on publicly available
    information regarding our lenders, we currently do not expect to
    lose borrowing capacity under our existing lines of credit and
    term loans as a result of a consolidation, merger or other
    business combination among our lenders. However, our access to
    funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of
    the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their
    funding commitments to us. We continue to closely monitor global
    economic conditions and the lenders who are parties to our
    credit facilities, as well as our long-term debt and credit
    ratings and outlooks, our customers’ financial positions,
    private capital raising and capital market activity.

Should we face a situation in which we do not have sufficient
    cash available to us through our operations to continue
    operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative
    ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include,
    without limitation, divesting ourselves of properties, whether
    or not the sales price is optimal or if they otherwise meet our
    strategic objectives to keep for the long term; issuing and
    selling our debt and equity in public or private transactions
    whether or not at favorable pricing or on favorable terms;
    entering into leases with our customers at lower rental rates or
    entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without
    an increase in rental rates at turnover or, in either case, on
    suboptimal terms.

Cash Flows.

As of December 31, 2008, cash
    provided by operating activities was $301.0 million as
    compared to $240.5 million for the same period in 2007.
    This change was primarily due to an increase in impairment
    losses, a decrease in income from operations, development
    profits and gains from sales and contributions of real estate
    interests, net, and changes in our accounts receivable and other
    assets and accounts payable and other liabilities. Cash used in
    investing activities was $888.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, as compared to cash used in investing
    activities of $632.2 million for the same period in 2007.
    This increase was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for
    property acquisitions, a decrease in net proceeds from
    divestiture of real estate and securities, an increase in loans
    made to affiliates and the purchase of additional equity
    interest in G. Accion, offset by an increase in repayment of
    mortgage and loan receivables and a decrease in additions to
    land, buildings, development costs, building improvements and
    lease costs. Cash provided by financing activities was
    $581.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    as compared to cash provided by financing activities of
    $420.0 million for the same period in 2007. This increase
    was due primarily to an increase in borrowings on other debt,
    net of payments, an increase in proceeds from issuances of
    senior debt, net of payments, an increase in borrowings on
    unsecured credit facilities, net of payments, a decrease in the
    repurchase of preferred units and a decrease in distributions to
    minority interests. This activity was partially offset by a
    decrease in the issuance of common stock.

Subject to the above discussion, we believe our sources of
    working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, and
    borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities, are
    adequate for us to meet our current liquidity requirements.
    However, there can be no assurance that our sources of capital
    will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to
    meet our needs. The unavailability of capital could adversely
    affect our financial



condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    cash dividends to our stockholders, and the market price of our
    stock.

Property Divestitures.

During 2008, we
    recognized development profits of approximately
    $7.2 million as a result of the sale of six development
    projects, aggregating approximately 73.9 million square
    feet, and two land parcels, aggregating approximately
    95 acres. During 2007, we recognized development profits of
    approximately $28.6 million as a result of the sale of
    seven development projects and 76 acres of land. During
    2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects
    totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an
    aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an
    after-tax gain of $13.5 million. In addition, during 2006,
    we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with
    the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of
    $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint
    venture partner’s share.

During 2008, we recognized development profits of approximately
    $73.9 million, as a result of the contribution of eleven
    completed development projects, aggregating approximately
    5.2 million square feet, to AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P., AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB Japan
    Fund I, L.P. and AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. During 2007, we
    recognized development profits of approximately
    $95.7 million, as a result of the contribution of 15
    completed development projects and 2 land parcels,
    aggregating approximately 82 acres of land, to AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB
    Japan Fund  I, L.P. During 2006, we contributed a
    total of nine completed development projects and one land parcel
    into unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures. Four projects
    totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were
    contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., two projects
    totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were
    contributed into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and three projects
    totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were
    contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.
    In addition, one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS
    Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we
    recognized an aggregate after-tax gain of $93.9 million,
    representing the portion of our interest in the contributed
    property acquired by the third-party investors for cash.

Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate
    Interests.

During 2008, we sold an approximate
    0.1 million square foot industrial operating property for a
    sale price of $3.6 million, with a resulting net gain of
    $0.7 million, and we also recognized a deferred gain of
    approximately $1.1 million on the divestiture of one
    industrial building, aggregating approximately 0.1 million
    square feet, for a price of $3.5 million, which was
    disposed of on December 31, 2007. During 2007, we divested
    ourselves of three industrial properties, aggregating
    approximately



0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of
    $120.0 million, with a resulting net gain of approximately
    $2.0 million, and sold two value-added conversion projects
    for a gain of approximately $60.0 million. During 2006, we
    divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating
    approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate
    price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of
    $42.6 million.

During 2008, we contributed an operating property for
    approximately $66.2 million, aggregating approximately
    0.8 million square feet, into AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. We recognized a gain of $20.0 million
    on the contribution, representing the portion of our interest in
    the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors
    for cash. During 2007, we contributed operating properties for
    approximately $524.9 million, aggregating approximately
    4.5 million square feet, into AMB Europe Fund I,
    FCP-FIS, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and
    AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. We recognized a gain of $73.4 million
    on the contributions, representing the portion of our interest
    in the contributed properties acquired by the third-party
    investors for cash. During 2006, there were no contributions of
    operating properties.

Properties Held for Divestiture or
    Contribution.

As of December 31, 2008, we
    held for divestiture two properties with an aggregate net book
    value of $8.2 million. These properties either are not in
    our core markets, do not meet our current investment objectives,
    or are included as part of our development-for-sale or
    value-added conversion programs. The divestitures of the
    properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and
    other customary conditions. Properties held for divestiture are
    stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs
    to sell. As of December 31, 2007, we held for divestiture
    five properties with an aggregate net book value of
    $40.5 million.

As of December 31, 2008, we held for contribution to
    co-investment ventures 20 properties with an aggregate net book
    value of $600.8 million which, when contributed, will
    reduce our average ownership interest in these projects from
    approximately 96% to an expected range of

15-20%.

As
    of December 31, 2008, properties with an aggregate net book
    value of $100.4 million were reclassified from properties
    held for contribution to investments in real estate as a result
    of the change in management’s expectations regarding the
    launch of a co-investment venture. These properties may be
    reclassified as properties held for contribution at some future
    time. In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting
    for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, as of
    December 31, 2008, we recognized additional depreciation
    expense and related accumulated depreciation of
    $2.2 million as a result of this reclassification, as well
    as impairment charges of $21.8 million on real estate
    assets held for divestiture or contribution for which it was
    determined that the carrying value was greater than its
    estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2007, we held for
    contribution to co-investment ventures 17 properties with an
    aggregate net book value of $488.3 million.

Co-investment Ventures.

Through the operating
    partnership, we enter into co-investment ventures with
    institutional investors. These co-investment ventures are
    managed by our private capital group and provide us with an
    additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions,
    development projects and renovation projects, as well as private
    capital income.

Third-party equity interests in the consolidated co-investment
    ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated
    financial statements. As of December 31, 2008, we owned
    approximately 78.7 million square feet of our properties
    (49.2% of the total operating and development portfolio) through
    our consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We
    may make additional investments through these co-investment
    ventures or new co-investment ventures in the future and
    presently plan to do so.

AMB Pier One, LLC, is a joint venture related to the 2000
    redevelopment of the pier that houses our global headquarters in
    San Francisco, California. On June 30, 2007, we
    exercised our option to purchase the remaining equity interest
    held by an unrelated third party, based on the fair market value
    as stipulated in the joint venture agreement, in AMB Pier One,
    LLC, for a nominal amount. As a result, the investment was
    consolidated as of June 30, 2007.

As of December 31, 2008, we also had a 100% consolidated
    interest in G. Accion, a Mexican real estate company, which has
    been renamed AMB Property Mexico, S.A. de C.V. AMB Property
    Mexico owns and develops real estate and provides real estate
    management and development services in Mexico. On June 13,
    2008, we



acquired approximately 19% of additional equity interest and on
    July 18, 2008, we acquired the remaining equity interest
    (approximately 42%) in AMB Property Mexico, increasing our
    equity interest from approximately 39% to 100%. Through our
    investment in AMB Property Mexico, we hold equity interests in
    various other unconsolidated ventures totaling approximately
    $24.6 million. In addition, in August 2008, one of our
    subsidiaries sold its approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo
    Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income trust
    specializing in aviation-related real estate at Canada’s
    international airports, as part of a tender offer for interests
    in the income trust. These equity investments of approximately
    $2.1 million (valued as of December 31,
    2007) were included in other assets on the consolidated
    balance sheets as of December 31, 2007.

Common and Preferred Equity.

We have
    authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred
    stock, of which the following series were designated as of
    December 31, 2008: 1,595,337 shares of series D
    cumulative redeemable preferred, none of which are outstanding;
    2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable
    preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding;
    2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable
    preferred, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares
    of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which
    are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P
    cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding.

As of December 31, 2008, no preferred units become callable
    in 2009.

On April 17, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all
    510,000 of its outstanding 8.00% Series I Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single
    institutional investor for an aggregate price of
    $25.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions.

    Redeemable Preferred Stock as preferred stock.

On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all
    800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single
    institutional investor for an aggregate price of
    $40.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions.
    In connection with this redemption, we reclassified all
    800,000 shares of our 7.95% Series J Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock as preferred stock.

On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all
    800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series K Cumulative

    Partnership Units of AMB Property II, L.P. were transferred from
    one institutional investor to another institutional investor. In
    connection with that transfer, on February 22, 2007, AMB
    Property II, L.P. amended the terms of the series D
    preferred units to, among other things, change the rate
    applicable to the series D preferred units from 7.75% to
    7.18% and change the date prior to which the series D
    preferred units may not be redeemed from May 5, 2004 to

On November 1, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., issued
    1,130,835 of its class B common limited partnership units
    in connection with a property acquisition.

In March 2007, we issued approximately 8.4 million shares
    of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately
    $472.1 million, which were contributed to the operating
    partnership in exchange for the issuance of approximately
    8.4 million general partnership units. As a result of the
    common stock issuance, there was a significant reallocation of
    partnership interests due to the difference in our stock price
    at issuance as compared to the book value per share at the time
    of issuance. We used the proceeds from the offering for general
    corporate purposes and, over the long term, to expand our global
    development business.

On September 21, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., repurchased
    all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative

    840,000 shares of our 8.125% Series H Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock as preferred stock.

On August 25, 2006, we issued and sold
    2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative
    Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are
    cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in
    arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.7125 per annum. The
    series P preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after
    August 25, 2011, subject to certain conditions, for cash at
    a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated
    and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We
    contributed the net proceeds of approximately $48.1 million
    to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating
    partnership issued to us 2,000,000 6.85% Series P
    Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units.

    stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to
    $200.0 million of our common stock, which shall terminate
    on December 31, 2009. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we repurchased approximately
    1.8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate
    price of $87.7 million at a weighted average price of
    $49.64 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
    we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our
    common stock for an aggregate price of $53.4 million at a
    weighted average price of $49.87 per share. We have the
    authorization to repurchase up to an additional
    $112.3 million of our common stock under the 2007 program.

Debt.

In order to maintain financial
    flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through
    market cycles, we presently intend over the long-term to operate
    with an our share of total debt-to-our share of total market
    capitalization ratio or our share of total debt-to-our share of
    total assets of approximately 45% or less. In order to operate
    at this targeted ratio over the long term, we are currently
    exploring various options to monetize our development assets
    through possible contribution to funds where capacity is
    available, the formation of joint ventures and the sale to third
    parties. We are also exploring the potential sale of operating
    assets to further enhance liquidity. As of December 31,
    2008, our share of total debt-to-our share of total market
    capitalization ratio was 61.4%. (See footnote 1 to the
    Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of
    “our share of total market capitalization,”
    “market equity,” “our share of total debt”
    and “our share of total assets”). We typically finance
    our co-investment ventures with secured debt at a loan-to-value
    ratio of

50-65%

per
    our co-investment venture agreements. Additionally, we currently
    intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an
    investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless
    of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not
    limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly,
    our management could alter or eliminate these policies without
    stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could
    render us unable to comply with these policies. For example,
    decreases in the market price of our common stock have caused an
    increase in the ratio of our share of total debt-to-our share of
    total market capitalization.

As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate principal amount of
    our secured debt was $1.5 billion, excluding unamortized
    debt premiums of $1.2 million. Of the $1.5 billion of
    secured debt, $808.1 million is secured by properties in
    our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non-recourse
    and bears interest at rates varying from 1.0% to 10.7% per annum
    (with a weighted average rate of 4.3%) and final maturity dates
    ranging from March 2009 to November 2022. As of
    December 31, 2008, $936.9 million of the secured debt
    obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average
    interest rate of 5.8%, while the remaining $586.8 million
    bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average
    interest rate of 2.6%).

On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P.,
    a Delaware limited partnership, which is one of our
    subsidiaries, entered into a loan agreement for a
    $305.0 million secured financing. On the same day, pursuant
    to the loan agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered
    four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which matures
    on March 5, 2012. One note had a principal of
    $160.0 million and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%.
    The second note had an initial principal borrowing of
    $40.0 million with a variable interest rate of
    81.0 basis points



above the one-month LIBOR rate. The third note has an initial
    principal borrowing of $84.0 million and a fixed interest rate
    of 5.90%. The fourth note had an initial principal borrowing of
    $21.0 million and bears interest at a variable rate of
    135.0 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate.

On September 4, 2008, the operating partnership entered
    into a $230.0 million secured term loan credit agreement
    that matures on September 4, 2010 and had a weighted
    average interest rate of 4.0% at December 31, 2008. We are
    the guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations
    under the term loan facility. The term loan facility carries a
    one-year extension option, which the operating partnership may
    exercise at its sole option so long as the operating
    partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment grade,
    among other things, and can be increased up to
    $300.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was
    130.0 basis points as of December 31, 2008, based on
    the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating.
    Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the base rate on the term
    loan was fixed at 2.7% through December 11, 2009 through
    interest rate swaps. If the operating partnership’s
    long-term debt ratings fall below current levels, our cost of
    debt will increase.

As of December 31, 2008, the operating partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.2 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 6.0% and had an average term of 4.1 years. In May
    2008, we sold $325.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    the operating partnership’s senior unsecured notes under
    its Series C medium-term note program. We guarantee the
    operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its
    unsecured senior debt securities. The unsecured senior debt
    securities are subject to various covenants. The covenants
    contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with
    financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified
    financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations
    on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or
    consolidations.

In March 2008, the operating partnership obtained a
    $325.0 million unsecured term loan facility, which had a
    balance of $325.0 million outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008, with a weighted average interest rate of
    3.5%. In February 2008, the operating partnership also obtained
    a $100.0 million unsecured money market loan with a
    weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and subsequently paid off
    the entire balance in June 2008. In June 2008, the operating
    partnership obtained a new $100.0 million unsecured loan
    with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and subsequently
    paid off the entire balance in September 2008. We guarantee the
    operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its
    unsecured debt. The unsecured debt is subject to various
    covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants,
    including compliance with financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and
    limitations on mergers or consolidations.

If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due
    at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital
    transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay
    dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt
    upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or
    other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance
    of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in
    higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest
    expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.
    This increased interest expense would adversely affect our
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, and the
    market price of our stock.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $392.8 million
    outstanding in other debt which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 3.9% and had an average term of 1.2 years. Other
    debt also includes a $70.0 million credit facility obtained
    on August 24, 2007 by AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund II, L.P., a subsidiary of the operating partnership,
    which had a $50.0 million balance outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008. We also had $342.8 million
    outstanding in other debt.

We may from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our
    outstanding debt through cash purchases

and/or

exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases,
    privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases
    or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market
    conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions
    and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

Credit Facilities.

The operating partnership
    has a $550.0 million (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds
    sterling or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured
    revolving credit facility, which bore a weighted average



interest rate of 2.85% at December 31, 2008. This facility
    matures on June 1, 2010. We are a guarantor of the
    operating partnership’s obligations under the credit
    facility. The line carries a one-year extension option, which
    the operating partnership may exercise at its sole option so
    long as the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating
    is investment grade, among other things, and the facility can be
    increased to up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions.
    The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin,
    which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2008,
    based on the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating,
    with an annual facility fee of 15.0 basis points. If the
    operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below
    current levels, our cost of debt will increase. If the operating
    partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below investment
    grade, the operating partnership will be unable to request money
    market loans and borrowings in Euros, Yen or British pounds
    sterling. The four-year credit facility includes a
    multi-currency component, under which up to $550.0 million
    can be drawn in Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or
    U.S. dollars. The operating partnership uses the credit
    facility principally for acquisitions, funding development
    activity and general working capital requirements. As of
    December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on this credit
    facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31,
    2008, was $243.1 million and the remaining amount available
    was $281.4 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of
    $25.5 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating
    partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on
    mergers or consolidations.

AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating
    partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit
    facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion
    Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on
    December 31, 2008, equaled approximately
    $606.5 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted
    average interest rate of 1.3%. We, along with the operating
    partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K.
    under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any
    other entity in which the operating partnership directly or
    indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from
    time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit
    agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the
    facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties
    and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South
    Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the
    option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the
    credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in
    entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility
    matures in June 2010 and has a one-year extension option, which
    the operating partnership may exercise at its sole option so
    long as the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating
    is investment grade, among other things. The extension option is
    also subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions and
    the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the
    outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The
    rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which
    was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2008, based
    on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s
    long-term debt. If the operating partnership’s long-term
    debt ratings fall below current levels, our cost of debt will
    increase. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable
    in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the
    operating partnership’s long-term debt, and was
    15.0 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the
    facility as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31,
    2008, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the
    exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2008, was
    $342.2 million, and the remaining amount available was
    $264.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and
    limitations on mergers or consolidations.

On July 16, 2007, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries
    and the operating partnership, each acting as a borrower, with
    us and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into a
    fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a
    $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that
    replaced the existing $250.0 million unsecured revolving
    credit facility. The fifth amended and restated credit facility
    amends the fourth amended and restated credit facility to, among
    other things, increase the facility amount to
    $500.0 million with an option to further increase the
    facility to $750.0 million, to extend the maturity date to
    July 2011 and to allow for future borrowing in Indian rupees.
    We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the
    obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled
    by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating
    partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant
    to our credit facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit
    facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the
    borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility
    includes a multi-currency component under which up to
    $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong
    dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds
    sterling, and Euros with the ability to add Indian rupees.



The line, which matures in July 2011, carries a one-year
    extension option, which the operating partnership may exercise
    at its sole option so long as the operating partnership’s
    long-term debt rating is investment grade, among other things,
    and can be increased to up to $750.0 million upon certain
    conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of
    the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is
    generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was 60.0 basis points
    as of December 31, 2008, based on the credit rating of the
    operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt,
    with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the
    operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. If
    the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall
    below current levels, our cost of debt will increase. If the
    operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below
    investment grade, the operating partnership will be unable to
    request borrowings in any currency other than U.S. dollars.
    The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to
    fund the acquisition and development of properties and general
    working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2008, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange
    rates in effect at December 31, 2008, was approximately
    $335.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of
    2.74%, and the remaining amount available was
    $164.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating
    partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on
    the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or
    consolidations.

On June 12, 2007, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS assumed a
    328.0 million Euro facility agreement, and we were released
    from all of our obligations and liabilities related to this
    facility agreement. On June 12, 2007, there were
    267.0 million Euros (approximately $355.2 million in
    U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12,
    2007) of term loans and no acquisition loans outstanding
    under the facility agreement.

Our share of total debt represents the pro rata portion of the
    total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of
    the consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures holding the
    debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful
    supplemental measure, which enables both management and
    investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to
    that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more
    meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies
    that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total
    debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should
    there be a default under any or all of such loans or a
    liquidation of the co-investment ventures. The above table
    reconciles our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a
    GAAP financial measure.

As of December 31, 2008, we had debt maturing in 2009 and
    2010, as well as debt maturing in 2009 and 2010 assuming
    extension options are exercised as follows (dollars in

    equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. Our
    definition of “market equity” is the total number of
    outstanding shares of our common stock and common limited
    partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of
    our common stock as of December 31, 2008. Our definition of
    “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation

Liquidity

As of December 31, 2008, we had $223.9 million in cash
    and cash equivalents and $710.2 million of additional
    available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had $27.3 million in restricted
    cash.

Our available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts
    managed by third party financial institutions and consist of
    invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. The invested
    cash is invested in money market funds that invest solely in
    direct obligations of the government of the United States or in
    time deposits with certain financial institutions. To date, we
    have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash
    or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that
    access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be
    impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.

At any point in time, we also have a significant amount of cash
    deposits in our operating accounts that are with third party
    financial institutions, which was, as of December 31, 2008,
    approximately $176.6 million on a consolidated basis. These
    balances exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
    insurance limits. While we monitor daily the cash balances in
    our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as
    appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the
    underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other
    adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have
    experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating
    accounts.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from
    operations, will not allow us to pay all of our debt as it comes
    due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net
    proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as
    property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain
    future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to
    obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, and
    the market price of our stock. We are currently exploring
    various options to monetize our development assets including
    contribution to funds where investment capacity is available,
    the formation of joint ventures and the sale of assets to third
    parties. We are also exploring the potential sale of operating
    assets to further enhance liquidity. There can be no assurance,
    however, that we will choose to or be able to monetize any of
    our assets.

Cash flows generated by our business were sufficient to cover
    our dividends and distributions for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Cash flows from our real
    estate operations and private capital businesses, which are
    included in “Net cash provided by operating
    activities” in our Cash Flows from Operating Activities and
    cash flows from our real estate development and operations
    businesses which are included in “Net proceeds from
    divestiture of real estate” in our Cash Flows from
    Investing Activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows, were sufficient to pay dividends on our common stock,
    distributions on our preferred stock and common and preferred
    limited partnership units of AMB Property, L.P. and AMB Property
    II, L.P. and distributions to minority interests for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Cash Flows from
    Operating Activities alone were not sufficient to pay such
    dividends and distributions for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, as shown in the table below. We
    use proceeds from our businesses included in Cash Flows from
    Investing Activities



(specifically, the proceeds from sales and contributions of
    properties as part of our real estate development and operations
    businesses) to fund dividends and distributions not covered by
    Cash Flows from Operating Activities.

Value-added conversion projects represent the repurposing of
    industrial properties to a higher and better use, including
    office, residential, retail, research and development or
    manufacturing. Activities required to prepare the property for
    conversion to a higher and better use may include such
    activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and
    retenanting. The sales price of the value-added conversion
    project is generally based on the



Development Pipeline.

As of December 31,
    2008, we had 53 projects in the development pipeline, on an
    owned and managed basis, which are expected to total
    approximately 16.4 million square feet and have an
    aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion upon
    completion. Four of these projects totaling approximately
    1.4 million square feet with an aggregate estimated
    investment of $80.0 million are held in an unconsolidated
    co-investment venture. We had an additional eight development
    projects held for divestiture or contribution totaling
    approximately 1.5 million square feet, with an aggregate
    estimated investment of $264.3 million, net of
    $3.3 million of real estate impairment losses, and an
    aggregate net book value of $258.4 million. As of
    December 31, 2008, on an owned and managed basis, we and
    our development joint venture partners have funded an aggregate
    of $1.1 billion, or 80%, of the total estimated investment
    and will need to fund an estimated additional
    $261.8 million, or 20%, in order to complete our
    development pipeline. The development pipeline, at
    December 31, 2008, included projects expected to be
    completed through the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition to our
    committed development pipeline, we hold a total of
    2,503 acres of land for future development or sale, on an
    owned and managed basis, approximately 86% of which is located
    in North America, including 79 acres that are held in an
    unconsolidated joint venture. We currently estimate that these
    2,503 acres of land could support approximately
    45.1 million square feet of future development.

Lease Commitments.

We have entered into
    operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily
    on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms
    from 1 to 54 years. These buildings and improvements
    subject to ground leases are amortized ratably over the lesser
    of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future
    minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating
    leases in effect as of December 31, 2008 were as follows

Co-Investment Ventures.

Through the operating
    partnership, we enter into co-investment ventures with
    institutional investors. These co-investment ventures are
    managed by AMB Capital Partners, LLC and provide us with an
    additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development
    projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital
    income. As of December 31, 2008, we had investments in
    three co-investment ventures with a gross book value of
    $1.2 billion, which are consolidated for financial
    reporting purposes, and net equity investments in five
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures of $356.9 million
    with a gross book value of $6.4 billion. As of
    December 31, 2008, we may make additional capital
    contributions to current and planned co-investment ventures of
    up to $120.1 million (using the exchange rates at
    December 31, 2008) pursuant to the terms of the
    co-investment venture agreements. From time to time, we may
    raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended unconsolidated
    co-investment venture formed in 2004 with institutional
    investors, most of whom invest through a private real estate
    investment trust, and for AMB Europe Fund  I, FCP-FIS,
    an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in
    2007 with institutional investors. This would increase our
    obligation to make additional capital commitments to these
    ventures. Pursuant to the terms of the



partnership agreement of AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P., and the management regulations of AMB
    Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, we are obligated to contribute 20%
    of the total equity commitments until such time when our total
    equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million or
    150.0 million Euros, respectively, at which time, our
    obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We
    expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations,
    borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances
    or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could
    adversely affect our cash flow; however, there can be no
    assurance that these sources of capital will be available at all
    or in amounts sufficient to meet our requirements.

Captive Insurance Company.

In December 2001,
    we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance
    coverage for all or a portion of losses below the attachment
    point of our third-party insurance policies. The captive
    insurance company is one element of our overall risk management
    program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable
    regulatory requirements. Arcata establishes annual premiums
    based on projections derived from the past loss experience of
    our properties. Like premiums paid to third-party insurance
    companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by
    customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, we think that we have more comprehensive insurance
    coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be
    available in the market.

Potential Contingent and Unknown
    Liabilities.

Contingent and unknown liabilities
    may include the following:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

losses in excess of insured coverage;

•

claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our
    predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions
    that had not been asserted or were unknown prior to our
    formation or acquisition transactions;

•

claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and
    directors and others indemnified by the former owners of our
    properties;

•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
    of business; and

•

tax, legal and regulatory liabilities.

    Balance Sheet Arrangements

Standby Letters of Credit.

As of
    December 31, 2008, we had provided approximately
    $32.7 million in letters of credit, of which
    $25.5 million were provided under the operating
    partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit
    facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under
    certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other
    commitments.

Guarantees and Contribution
    Obligations.

Excluding parent guarantees
    associated with debt or contribution obligations as discussed in
    Notes 6 and 10, we had outstanding guarantees and
    contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of
    $639.9 million as described below.

As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding bank guarantees
    in the amount of $27.8 million used to secure contingent
    obligations, primarily obligations under development and
    purchase agreements, including $0.7 million guaranteed
    under a purchase agreement entered into by an unconsolidated
    joint venture. As of December 31, 2008, we also guaranteed
    $49.6 million and $231.8 million on outstanding loans
    for six of our consolidated joint ventures and four of our
    unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively.

Also, we have entered into contribution agreements with certain
    of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These contribution
    agreements require us to make additional capital contributions
    to the applicable co-investment venture fund upon certain
    defaults by the co-investment venture of certain of its debt
    obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital
    contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than our share of the co-investment venture’s debt
    obligation or the value of our share of any property securing
    such debt. Our contribution obligations under these agreements
    will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the
    fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the
    debt and obtained by the lender upon default. Our potential
    obligations under these contribution agreements total
    $260.6 million as of December 31, 2008.

On May 30, 2008, the operating partnership entered into a
    142.0 million

Euro 364-day

multi-currency revolving facility agreement (approximately
    $198.4 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange
    rate at December 31, 2008) and related guarantee as
    loan guarantor with our affiliate AMB Fund Management
    S.à.r.l. on behalf of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS,
    certain of our European affiliates, ING Real Estate Finance N.V.
    and certain of its European affiliates and ING Real Estate
    Finance N.V. The facility agreement provided that certain of the
    affiliates of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS may borrow
    unsecured loans in an aggregate amount of up to
    142.0 million Euros (approximately $198.4 million in
    U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31,
    2008) all of which were repayable 364 days after the
    date of the facility agreement (unless otherwise agreed). All
    amounts owed under the facility agreement were guaranteed by the
    operating partnership. AMB Fund Management S.á.r.l. on
    behalf of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS indemnified the
    operating partnership for all of its obligations under the
    guarantee. On December 29, 2008, the operating partnership
    terminated the facility agreement and related guarantee. Prior
    to the termination of the facility agreement, four of our
    European affiliates that were subsidiaries of AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS holding real property interests in Germany
    were borrowers under such facility agreement. The outstanding
    borrowed amount of our European affiliate borrowers under such
    facility agreement was repaid in full on December 29, 2008.
    In connection with the payment in full under, and the
    termination of, this facility agreement, our European affiliate
    borrowers

and/or

their
    affiliates borrowed funds under an existing credit facility held
    by AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, and entered new

5-year

term
    loans with the lender in the aggregate amount of
    50.2 million Euros (approximately $70.1 million in
    U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of
    December 31, 2008) under such facility. The borrowed
    funds were used to repay the outstanding amounts under the
    terminated 142.0 million Euro credit facility. The European
    affiliate borrowers are in the process of granting security
    interests to the lender, as the security agent, under and in
    accordance with the terms of such facility, all of which
    security interests are expected to become effective in the first
    half of 2009. The operating partnership has agreed to guarantee
    the 50.2 million Euros amount borrowed under such existing
    credit facility only until the security interests are granted,
    at which time the guarantees will be extinguished.

Performance and Surety Bonds.

As of
    December 31, 2008, we had outstanding performance and
    surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $17.8 million. These
    bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development
    projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations
    and the construction of certain real



property improvements and infrastructure. Performance and surety
    bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due
    or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure.

Promote Interests and Other Contractual
    Obligations.

Upon the achievement of certain
    return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may
    be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture
    partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their
    contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal
    course of our business, we enter into various contracts with
    third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay
    promotes or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of
    certain events.

Supplemental
    Earnings Measures

Funds
    From Operations (“FFO”) and Funds From Operations Per
    Share and Unit (“FFOPS”).

We believe that net income (loss), as defined by U.S. GAAP,
    is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider
    funds from operations, or FFO, and FFO per share and unit, or
    FFOPS, to be useful supplemental measures of our operating
    performance. We define FFOPS as FFO per fully diluted weighted
    average share of our common stock and operating partnership
    units. We calculate FFO as net income (loss), calculated in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP, less gains (or losses) from
    dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and
    real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our
    pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint
    ventures.

We include the gains from development, including those from
    value-added conversion projects, before depreciation recapture,
    as a component of FFO. We believe that value-added conversion
    dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be
    included in FFO, consistent with the real estate investment
    trust industry’s long standing practice to include gains on
    the sale of land in FFO. However, our interpretation of FFO or
    FFOPS may not be consistent with the views of others in the real
    estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be a
    divergence from the National Association of Real Estate
    Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition, and may not
    be comparable to FFO or FFOPS reported by other real estate
    investment trusts that interpret the current NAREIT definition
    differently than we do. In connection with the formation of a
    joint venture, we may warehouse assets that are acquired with
    the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed
    venture. Some of the properties held for contribution may, under
    certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated under
    U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, we intend to
    include in our calculation of FFO gains or losses related to the
    contribution of previously depreciated real estate to joint
    ventures. Although such a change, if instituted, will be a
    departure from the current NAREIT definition, we believe such
    calculation of FFO will better reflect the value created as a
    result of the contributions. To date, we have not included gains
    or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated
    warehoused assets in FFO.

We believe that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful supplemental
    measures of our operating performance because historical cost
    accounting for real estate assets in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate
    assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through
    depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real
    estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and
    other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have
    considered presentation of operating results for real estate
    companies that use historical cost accounting to be
    insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of
    operating performance for real estate investment trusts that
    exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among
    other items, from net income (loss), as defined by
    U.S. GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO and FFOPS,
    combined with the required U.S. GAAP presentations, has
    been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating
    results of real estate investment trusts among the investing
    public and making comparisons of operating results among such
    companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and FFOPS to be
    useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and
    financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses
    related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate
    assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and
    FFOPS can help the investing public compare the operating
    performance of a company’s real estate between periods or
    as compared to other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant
    and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate
    investment trusts, FFO and FFOPS do not represent cash flow from
    operations or net income (loss) as defined by U.S. GAAP and
    should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in
    evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS
    also do not consider the costs associated with capital
    expenditures related to our real estate assets



nor are FFO and FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available
    to fund our future cash requirements. Management compensates for
    the limitations of FFO and FFOPS by providing investors with
    financial statements prepared according to U.S. GAAP, along
    with this detailed discussion of FFO and FFOPS and a
    reconciliation of FFO and FFOPS to net income, a U.S. GAAP
    measurement.

The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled

SS
    NOI

We believe that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the
    most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same
    store net operating income, or SS NOI, and cash-basis SS NOI to
    be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance.
    Properties that are considered part of the same store pool
    include all properties that were owned, or owned and managed, as
    the case may be, as of the end of both the current and prior
    year reporting periods and exclude development properties for
    both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store
    pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and
    developments stabilized after December 31, 2006 (generally
    defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that
    have been substantially complete for at least 12 months).
    In deriving SS NOI, we define net operating income as rental
    revenues, including reimbursements, less property operating
    expenses, both of which are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
    Property operating expenses exclude depreciation, amortization,
    general and administrative expenses and interest expense. In
    calculating cash-basis SS NOI, we exclude straight-line rents
    and amortization of lease intangibles from the calculation of SS
    NOI. We consider cash-basis SS NOI to be an appropriate and
    useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the
    operating performance of our real estate portfolio excluding
    effects of non-cash adjustments and provides a better measure of
    actual cash-basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison.
    In addition, we believe that SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI help
    the investing public compare our operating performance with that
    of other



companies. While SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI are relevant and
    widely used measures of operating performance of real estate
    investment trusts, they do not represent cash flow from
    operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be
    considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our
    liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI
    also do not reflect general and administrative expenses,
    interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital
    expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and
    construction activities that could materially impact our results
    from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI and
    cash-basis SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real
    estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for
    calculating these measures.

The following table reconciles SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI from
    net income (loss) for the years ended December 31 (dollars in

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market
    prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our
    future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing
    market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching
    projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing
    activities with projected cash outflows for debt service,
    acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to
    stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The
    majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which
    minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to
    market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection
    with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings
    and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval,
    thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could
    adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2008,
    we had three outstanding interest rate swaps, two interest rate
    caps, and two outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts
    with an aggregate notional amount of $876.8 million (in
    U.S. dollars). See “Financial Instruments” below.



The table below summarizes the maturities and interest rates
    associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding at
    book value and estimated fair value before net unamortized debt
    discounts of $9.7 million as of December 31, 2008

If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased
    or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest
    cost on our variable rate debt would be $3.6 million (net
    of the swap) annually. As of December 31, 2008, the book
    value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated
    debt (both secured and unsecured) was $4.0 billion and
    $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of
    current market interest rates.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, variable rate debt
    comprised 38.0% and 39.0%, respectively, of all our outstanding
    debt. Variable rate debt was $1.5 billion and
    $1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2008
    and 2007.

Financial Instruments.

We record all
    derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in
    non-functional currencies, we may use derivative financial
    instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our
    derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31,
    2008 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of
    variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD), two
    interest rate caps hedging cash flows of variable rate
    borrowings based on Japanese Yen Libor, and two currency forward
    contracts hedging intercompany loans.

International Operations.

Our exposure to
    market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk.
    The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our
    subsidiaries operating in the United States, Mexico and certain
    subsidiaries in Europe. The functional currency for our
    subsidiaries operating outside the United States, other than
    Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe, is generally the
    local currency of the country in which the entity or property is
    located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and
    losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
    U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into
    U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the
    exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We
    translate income statement accounts using the average exchange
    rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions
    using the rate on the transaction date. The gains resulting from
    the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and
    totaled $23.6 million and $14.8 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated
    in currencies other than their functional currency. In these
    instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at
    the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities
    are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the
    period and income



statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate
    for the period. We also record gains or losses in the income
    statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in
    a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is
    settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more
    or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect
    when the transaction was initiated. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, total unrealized and
    realized (losses) gains from remeasurement included in our
    results of operations were $(5.7) million,
    $3.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively.

Controls

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures and Changes to Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

As required by

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried
    out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the
    design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
    that were in effect as of the end of the year covered by this
    report. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
    each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective at a reasonable assurance level as of
    December 31, 2008.

No changes were made in our internal control over financial
    reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting.

Our management has used the framework set forth in the report
    entitled “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
    Based on our evaluation under the framework in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework,” our management
    has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
    was effective as of December 31, 2008. The effectiveness of
    our internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

We have excluded G. Accion, S.A. de C.V. (“G. Accion”)
    from the evaluation of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008 because it was acquired
    by us in a purchase business combination during 2008. G. Accion
    is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and total
    revenues represents 2.40% and 0.25%, respectively, of our
    related consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and
    for the year ended December 31, 2008.

of AMB Property Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in

    Corporation (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
    schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)
    presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
    consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Item 9A. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

, on January 1, 2007. As discussed in
    Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

, on January 1,
    2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting, included in Item 9A,
    management has excluded G. Accion, S.A. de C.V. (“G.
    Accion”) from its assessment of internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 due to its
    acquisition in a purchase business combination in 2008. We have
    also excluded G. Accion from our audit of internal control over
    financial reporting. G. Accion is a wholly-owned subsidiary
    whose total assets and total revenues represent 2.40% and 0.25%
    of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of
    and for the year ended December 31, 2008.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006

1.

Organization
    and Formation of the Company

AMB Property Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the
    “Company”), commenced operations as a fully integrated
    real estate company effective with the completion of its initial
    public offering on November 26, 1997. The Company elected
    to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under
    Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its
    taxable year ended December 31, 1997, and believes its
    current organization and method of operation will enable it to
    maintain its status as a REIT. The Company, through its
    controlling interest in its subsidiary, AMB Property, L.P., a
    Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating
    Partnership”), is engaged in the ownership, acquisition,
    development and operation of industrial properties in key
    distribution markets throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia.
    Unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company”
    means AMB Property Corporation, the Operating Partnership and
    their other controlled subsidiaries.

The Company uses the terms “industrial properties” or
    “industrial buildings” to describe various types of
    industrial properties in its portfolio and uses these terms
    interchangeably with the following: logistics facilities,
    centers or warehouses; distribution facilities, centers or
    warehouses; High Throughput
    Distribution

®

(HTD

®

)

    facilities; or any combination of these terms. The Company uses
    the term “owned and managed” to describe assets in
    which it has at least a 10% ownership interest, for which it is
    the property or asset manager and for which it currently intends
    to hold long-term. The Company uses the term “joint
    venture” to describe all joint ventures, including
    co-investment ventures, with real estate developers, other real
    estate operators, or institutional investors where the Company
    may or may not have control, act as the manager

and/or

developer, earn asset management distributions or fees, or earn
    incentive distributions or promote interests. In certain cases,
    the Company might provide development, leasing, property
    management

and/or

accounting services, for which it may receive compensation. The
    Company uses the term “co-investment venture” to
    describe joint ventures with institutional investors, managed by
    the Company, from which the Company receives acquisition fees
    for third-party acquisitions, portfolio and asset management
    distributions or fees, as well as incentive distributions or
    promote interests.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company owned an approximate
    96.6% general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership,
    excluding preferred units. The remaining approximate 3.4% common
    limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated
    investors and certain current and former directors and officers
    of the Company. As the sole general partner of the Operating
    Partnership, the Company has full, exclusive and complete
    responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and
    control of the Operating Partnership. Net operating results of
    the Operating Partnership are allocated after preferred unit
    distributions based on the respective partners’ ownership
    interests. Certain properties are owned by the Company through
    limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other
    entities. The ownership of such properties through such entities
    does not materially affect the Company’s overall ownership
    interests in the properties.

Through the Operating Partnership, the Company enters into
    co-investment ventures with institutional investors. These
    co-investment ventures provide the Company with an additional
    source of capital and income. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company had significant investments in three consolidated and
    five unconsolidated co-investment ventures. On July 1,
    2008, the partners of AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a
    consolidated co-investment venture) contributed their interests
    in AMB Partners II, L.P. to AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. in exchange for interests in AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated
    co-investment venture. No gain or loss was recognized on the
    contribution.

Any references to the number of buildings, square footage,
    customers and occupancy in the financial statement footnotes are
    unaudited.

On July 18, 2008, the Company acquired the remaining equity
    interest (approximately 42%) in G. Accion, S.A. de C.V.
    (“G. Accion”), a Mexican real estate company. G.
    Accion is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and has
    been renamed AMB Property Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (“AMB
    Property Mexico”). AMB Property

Mexico owns and develops real estate and provides real estate
    management and development services in Mexico. Through its
    investment in AMB Property Mexico, the Company holds equity
    interests in various other unconsolidated joint ventures
    totaling approximately $24.6 million as of
    December 31, 2008.

AMB Capital Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
    (“AMB Capital Partners”), provides real estate
    investment services to clients on a fee basis. Headlands Realty
    Corporation, a Maryland corporation, conducts a variety of
    businesses that include development projects available for sale
    or contribution to third parties and incremental income
    programs. IMD Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
    conducts a variety of businesses that also include development
    projects available for sale or contribution to third parties.
    AMB Capital Partners, Headlands Realty Corporation and IMD
    Holding Corporation are direct subsidiaries of the Operating
    Partnership.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company owned or had
    investments in, on a consolidated basis or through
    unconsolidated joint ventures, properties and development
    projects expected to total approximately 160.0 million
    square feet (14.9 million square meters) in 49 markets
    within 15 countries. Additionally, as of December 31, 2008,
    the Company managed, but did not have an ownership interest in,
    industrial and other properties, totaling approximately
    1.1 million square feet.

Of the approximately 160.0 million square feet as of
    December 31, 2008:

•

on an owned and managed basis, which includes investments held
    on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint
    ventures, the Company owned or partially owned approximately
    131.5 million square feet (principally, warehouse
    distribution buildings) that were 95.1% leased; the Company had
    investments in 53 development projects, which are expected to
    total approximately 16.4 million square feet upon
    completion; and the Company owned 16 development projects,
    totaling approximately 4.6 million square feet, which are
    available for sale or contribution;

•

through non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, the Company
    had investments in 46 industrial operating properties, totaling
    approximately 7.4 million square feet; and

•

the Company held approximately 0.1 million square feet
    through a ground lease, which is the location of the
    Company’s global headquarters.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements included herein have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows of the Company, its wholly-owned
    qualified REIT and taxable REIT subsidiaries, the Operating
    Partnership and co-investment ventures, in which the Company has
    a controlling interest. Third-party equity interests in the
    Operating Partnership and co-investment ventures are reflected
    as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements.
    The Company also has non-controlling partnership interests in
    unconsolidated real estate co-investment ventures, which are
    accounted for under the equity method. All significant
    intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications.

Certain items in the
    consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been
    reclassified to conform to current classifications.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless
    circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which
    case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the

F-7


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

property is made to reduce it to its estimated fair value. The
    Company also regularly reviews the impact of above or
    below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs
    for acquisitions, and records an intangible asset or liability
    accordingly.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local airport
    authorities, and subject to ground leases are depreciated over
    the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the
    underlying ground lease. The estimated lives and components of
    depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows (dollars in
    thousands):

The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase
    price of the property including legal fees and acquisition
    costs. Project costs directly associated with the development
    and construction of a real estate project, which include
    interest and property taxes, are capitalized as construction in
    progress. Capitalized interest related to construction projects
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $64.4 million, $64.0 million and $42.9 million,
    respectively.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Maintenance expenditures include
    painting and repair costs. The Company expenses costs as
    incurred and does not accrue in advance of planned major
    maintenance activities. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic useful life of assets are capitalized
    and include parking lot, HVAC and roof replacement costs.

Real Estate Impairment Losses.

Carrying values
    for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on
    a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    When the carrying value of a property or land parcel is greater
    than its estimated fair value, based on the intended use and
    holding period, an impairment charge to earnings is recognized
    for the excess over its estimated fair value less costs to sell.
    The intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for
    the long term, can significantly impact how impairment is
    measured. If an asset is intended to be held for the long term,
    the impairment analysis is based on a two-step test. The first
    test measures estimated expected future cash flows over the
    holding period, including a residual value (undiscounted and
    without interest charges), against the carrying value of the
    property. If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying
    value is measured against the lower of cost or the present value
    of expected cash flows over the expected hold period. An
    impairment charge to earnings is

F-8


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recognized for the excess of the asset’s carrying value
    over the lower of cost or the present values of expected cash
    flows over the expected hold period. If an asset is intended to
    be sold, impairment is determined using the estimated fair value
    less costs to sell. The estimation of expected future net cash
    flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions
    regarding current and future economic and market conditions and
    the availability of capital. The Company determines the
    estimated fair values based on its assumptions regarding rental
    rates, costs to complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values.
    The Company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams
    and the recent valuations of its two open-ended funds, which
    contain a large, geographically diversified pool of assets, all
    of which are subject to third-party appraisals at year end. As a
    result of leasing activity and the economic environment, the
    Company re-evaluated the carrying value of its investments and
    recorded real estate impairment losses of $193.9 million,
    $1.2 million and $6.3 million during the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, on certain
    of its investments.

Investments in Consolidated and Unconsolidated Joint
    Ventures.

Minority interests represent the
    limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and
    interests held by certain third parties in several real estate
    joint ventures, which own properties aggregating approximately
    22.3 million square feet as of December 31, 2008,
    which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Such
    investments are consolidated because the Company exercises
    significant control over major operating decisions such as
    approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset
    management, investment activity and changes in financing.

The Company holds interests in both consolidated and
    unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company determines
    consolidation based on standards set forth in FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB
    No. 51

(FIN 46) or EITF Issue

No. 04-5

(EITF 04-5),

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

and

SOP 78-9,

Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures.

For
    joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined
    under FIN 46 where the Company is not the primary
    beneficiary, it does not consolidate the joint venture for
    financial reporting purposes. Based on the guidance set forth in

EITF 04-5,

the Company consolidates certain joint venture investments
    because it exercises significant control over major operating
    decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property
    managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in
    financing. The Company is the general partner (or equivalent of
    a general partner in entities not structured as partnerships) in
    a number of the Company’s consolidated joint venture
    investments. In all such cases, the limited partners in such
    investments (or equivalent of limited partners in such
    investments which are not structured as partnerships) do not
    have rights described in

EITF 04-5,

which would preclude consolidation. The Company consolidates
    certain other joint ventures where it is not the general partner
    (or equivalent of a general partner in entities not structured
    as partnerships) because the Company has control over those
    entities through majority ownership, retention of the majority
    of economics, and a combination of substantive kick-out rights

and/or

substantive participating rights. For joint ventures under

EITF 04-5

where the Company does not exercise significant control over
    major operating and management decisions, but where it exercises
    significant influence, the Company uses the equity method of
    accounting and does not consolidate the joint venture for
    financial reporting purposes. In such unconsolidated joint
    ventures, either the Company is not the general partner (or
    general partner equivalent) and does not hold sufficient capital
    or any rights that would require consolidation or,
    alternatively, the Company is the general partner (or the
    general partner equivalent) and the other partners (or
    equivalent) hold substantive participating rights that override
    the presumption of control.

The minority interests associated with certain of the
    Company’s consolidated joint ventures that have finite
    lives under the terms of the partnership agreements represent
    mandatorily redeemable interests as defined in
    SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
    Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity

(SFAS No. 150). As of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, the aggregate book value of these minority interests in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was approximately
    $293.4 million and $517.6 million, respectively, and
    the Company believes that the aggregate settlement value of
    these interests was approximately $451.2 million and
    $1.1 billion, respectively. However, there can be no
    assurance that these amounts will be the aggregate settlement
    value of the interests. The aggregate settlement value is based
    on the estimated liquidation values of the assets and

F-9


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

liabilities and the resulting proceeds that the Company would
    distribute to its joint venture partners upon dissolution, as
    required under the terms of the respective joint venture
    agreements. There can be no assurance that the estimated
    liquidation values of the assets and liabilities and the
    resulting proceeds that the Company distributes upon dissolution
    will be the same as the actual liquidation values of such
    assets, liabilities and proceeds distributed upon dissolution.
    Subsequent changes to the estimated fair values of the assets
    and liabilities of the consolidated joint ventures will affect
    the Company’s estimate of the aggregate settlement value.
    The joint venture agreements do not limit the amount to which
    the minority joint venture partners would be entitled in the
    event of liquidation of the assets and liabilities and
    dissolution of the respective joint ventures.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less. These balances exceed the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While
    the Company monitors daily the cash balances in its operating
    accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate, these
    cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial
    institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in
    the financial markets. To date, the Company has experienced no
    loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with property purchases,
    Section 1031 exchange accounts and debt or real estate tax
    payments.

Accounts Receivable.

Accounts receivable
    includes all current accounts receivable, net of allowances,
    other accruals and deferred rent receivable of
    $63.9 million and $73.0 million as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company
    regularly reviews the credit worthiness of its customers and
    adjusts its allowance for doubtful accounts, straight-line rent
    receivable balance and tenant improvement and leasing costs
    amortization accordingly.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

Other real
    estate companies compete with the Company in its real estate
    markets. This results in competition for customers to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Company’s ability to lease space and
    on the amount of rent received. As of December 31, 2008,
    the Company does not have any material concentration of credit
    risk due to the diversification of its customers.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the straight-line method, which
    approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the
    related loan. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, deferred
    financing costs were $25.3 million and $23.3 million,
    respectively, net of accumulated amortization.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

The Company
    has classified as goodwill the cost in excess of fair value of
    the net assets of companies acquired in purchase transactions.
    As prescribed in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

, goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible
    assets, are no longer amortized, but are subject to at least
    annual impairment testing. The Company tests annually (or more
    often, if necessary) for impairment under
    SFAS No. 142. The Company performed a test for
    impairment and determined that there was no impairment to
    goodwill and intangible assets during the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Income Taxes.

In July 2006, the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109,

(FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting
    and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions, as defined.
    FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated
    with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related
    to accounting for income taxes. Adoption of FIN 48 on
    January 1, 2007 did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial statements. The tax years 2003 through
    2007 remain open to examination by the major taxing
    jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.

Financial Instruments.

SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging
    Activities,

provides comprehensive guidelines for the
    recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging
    activities and, specifically, requires all derivatives to be
    recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income or loss for the effective portion of the hedged
    instrument. The Company assesses the effectiveness of each
    hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or
    cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes
    in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or
    transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes
    in fair value are recognized in earnings.

For revenues or expenses denominated in nonfunctional
    currencies, the Company may use derivative financial instruments
    to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. The
    Company’s derivative financial instruments in effect at
    December 31, 2008 consisted of three interest rate swaps
    hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on
    U.S. Libor (USD), two interest rate caps hedging cash flows
    of variable rate borrowings based on Japanese Yen Libor, and two
    currency forward contracts hedging intercompany loans.
    Adjustments to the fair value of this instrument for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 resulted in losses of
    $6.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively. These
    losses are included in other assets in the consolidated balance
    sheet and accumulated other comprehensive loss in the
    consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

Debt.

The Company’s debt includes both
    fixed and variable rate secured debt, fixed and variable rate
    unsecured debt, unsecured variable rate debt and credit
    facilities. Based on borrowing rates available to the Company at
    December 31, 2008, the book value and the estimated fair
    value of the total debt (both secured and unsecured) was
    $4.0 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.

Debt Premiums.

Debt premiums represent the
    excess of the fair value of debt over the principal value of
    debt assumed in connection with the Company’s initial
    public offering and subsequent property acquisitions. The debt
    premiums are being amortized as an offset to interest expense
    over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest
    method. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the net
    unamortized debt discount was $9.8 million and
    $5.2 million, respectively, and was included as a component
    of secured debt and unsecured senior debt on the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets.

Rental Revenues and Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts.

The Company, as a lessor, retains
    substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of the
    properties and accounts for its leases as operating leases.
    Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    term of the leases. Reimbursements from customers for real
    estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are
    incurred. The Company also records lease termination fees when a
    customer terminates its lease by executing a definitive
    termination agreement with the Company, vacates the premises and
    the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any
    conditions that must be met before the fee is due to the
    Company. In addition, the Company nets its allowance for
    doubtful accounts against rental income for financial reporting
    purposes. Such amounts totaled $3.9 million,
    $3.7 million and $2.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Private Capital Income.

Private capital income
    consists primarily of acquisition and development fees, asset
    management fees and priority distributions earned by the Company
    from co-investment ventures and clients. Private capital income
    also includes promote interests and incentive distributions from
    the Operating Partnership’s co-investment ventures. The
    Company received incentive distributions of $33.7 million,
    $0.5 million and $22.5 million (of which
    $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P.),
    respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006.

Development Profits, Net of Taxes.

When the
    Company disposes of its real estate entities’ interests,
    gains reported from the sale of these interests represent
    either: (i) the sale of partial interests in consolidated
    co-investment ventures to third-party investors for cash or
    (ii) the sale of partial interests in properties to
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures with third-party investors
    for cash.

Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate
    Interests.

Gains and losses are recognized using
    the full accrual method. Gains related to transactions which do
    not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of
    accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual
    method of accounting criteria are met.

Other Income (Expense).

Other income (expense)
    consists primarily of foreign currency remeasurement losses and
    gains, losses and gains on the Company’s non qualified
    deferred compensation plan and interest income from mortgages
    receivable and on cash and cash equivalents.

Discontinued Operations.

The Company reported
    real estate dispositions as discontinued operations separately
    as prescribed under the provisions of SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets

(SFAS No. 144). The Company separately
    reports as discontinued operations the historical operating
    results attributable to operating properties sold or held for
    disposition and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition
    of the properties, which is included in development gains and
    gains from dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and
    minority interests, in the statement of operations. The
    consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also
    adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact
    on the Company’s previously reported consolidated financial
    position, net income or cash flows.

International Operations.

The U.S. dollar
    is the functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries
    formed in the United States, Mexico and certain subsidiaries in
    Europe. Other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe,
    the functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries
    operating outside the United States is generally the local
    currency of the country in which the entity or property is
    located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and
    losses. The Company’s subsidiaries whose functional
    currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial
    statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are
    translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial
    statement date. The Company translates income statement accounts
    using the average exchange rate for the period and significant
    nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction
    date. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    gains (losses) resulting from the translation were
    $23.6 million, $14.8 million and $(0.2) million,
    respectively. These gains (losses) are included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity.

The Company’s international subsidiaries may have
    transactions denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currencies. In these instances, non-monetary assets
    and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate,
    monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange
    rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement
    accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the
    period. The Company also records gains or losses in the income
    statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in
    a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is
    settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more
    or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect
    when the transaction was initiated. Unrealized and realized
    gains (losses) from remeasurement were $(5.7) million,
    $3.9 million and $0.8 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These gains
    (losses) are included in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In September
    2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements,

which defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosure
    requirements for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received
    for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
    the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    on the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 also establishes
    a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the
    use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
    inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three
    levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated
    balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the
    valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
    liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative
    contracts that are traded in an active exchange market.

F-12


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Level 2.

Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities
    include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less
    frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative
    contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with
    inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This
    category generally includes certain corporate debt securities
    and derivative contracts.

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation. This
    category generally includes long-term derivative contracts and
    real estate.

The fair value at December 31, 2008 reflects an loss on
    impairment of real estate assets of $193.9 million
    recognized in the consolidated statement of operations during
    the year ended December 31, 2008, measured on a
    nonrecurring basis.

The fair value at December 31, 2008 reflects an
    other-than-temporary loss on impairment of an investment of
    $5.5 million recognized in the consolidated statement of
    operations during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 157 with respect to its financial assets and
    liabilities, but not with respect to its nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities (such as real estate, which is not subject to annual
    fair value measurements) as those provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 were deferred to fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, in
    conjunction with a SFAS No. 144 review for impairment
    (as discussed in Note 3), selected assets were adjusted to
    fair value and impairment charges were recorded. In this
    circumstance, although SFAS No. 157 has not been
    adopted for the valuation of nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities, the disclosures under that guidance have been
    provided. SFAS No. 157 had no material impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows with respect to the provisions of SFAS No. 157
    that were adopted.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

, which changes the accounting for
    business combinations including the measurement of acquirer
    shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the
    recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for
    pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the accounting for
    acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment
    of acquisition-related transaction costs and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. With
    respect to transactions costs, of the three alternatives
    available to transition to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R), the Company has elected to capitalize
    acquisition related costs and expense in the interim period in
    which SFAS No. 141(R) is adopted. The Company is in
    the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows, but at a minimum, it will
    require the expensing of transaction costs related to business
    combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51

,
    which clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary
    is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should
    be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.
    This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company
    is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 will have on its financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133,

which requires entities to provide enhanced
    disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under Statement No. 133 and
    its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
    SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
    The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 161.

3.

Impairment
    and Restructuring Charges

The Company conducted a comprehensive review of all real estate
    asset classes in accordance with SFAS No. 144

,

which indicates that asset values should be analyzed
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. The
    process entailed the analysis of each asset class for instances
    where the book value exceeded the estimated fair value. As a
    result of changing market conditions, a portion of the
    Company’s real estate assets were written down to estimated
    fair value and a non-cash impairment charge was recognized.

In order to comply with disclosure requirements as outlined in
    SFAS No. 157, the designation of the level of inputs
    used in the fair value models must be determined. Inputs used in
    establishing estimated fair value for real estate assets
    generally fall within level three, which are characterized as
    requiring significant judgment as little or no current market
    activity may be available for validation. The main indicator
    used to establish the classification of the inputs was current
    market conditions that, in many instances, resulted in the use
    of significant unobservable inputs in establishing estimated
    fair value measurements.

The Company used a discounted cash flow model to determine the
    estimated fair value of land, assets under development and
    assets held for sale or contribution. The key inputs used in the
    model included the Company’s intent to sell, hold or
    contribute, along with rental rate assumptions, discount rates,
    estimated costs to complete and expected

lease-up

and
    holding periods. When available, current market information was
    used to determine capitalization and rental growth rates. When
    market information was not readily available, the inputs were
    based on the Company’s understanding of market conditions
    and the experience of the management team. Actual results could
    differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. The
    discount rates used in the fair value estimates ranged from
    8-11% and represent a rate commensurate with the indicated
    holding period with a premium layered on for risk. In a few
    instances, current comparative sales values were available and
    used to establish estimated fair value. Additional impairments
    may be necessary in the future in the event that market
    conditions continue to deteriorate and impact the factors used
    to estimate fair value. The impairment loss charges recognized
    on these assets represent the difference between the carrying
    value and the estimated fair value, which totaled approximately
    $94.7 million for land, and $99.2 million for assets
    under development and assets held for sale or contribution for
    the year ended December 31, 2008.

F-14


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition to real estate impairment charges, the Company
    reviewed its investment strategies and in light of the
    significant deterioration of the credit markets and the
    Company’s emphasis on liquidity preservation, certain
    development projects will no longer be pursued. A non-cash
    charge of approximately $11.8 million representing pursuit
    costs of development projects that will no longer be pursued and
    a reserve against tax assets associated with a reduction in
    these development projects, recorded in general and
    administrative expense on the consolidated statement of
    operations, was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008.

The impairment charges disclosed above do not impact the
    Company’s liquidity, cost and availability of credit or
    affect the Company’s continued compliance with its various
    financial covenants under its credit facilities and unsecured
    bonds.

To position the Company to meet the challenges of the current
    business environment, the Company implemented a broad based cost
    reduction plan in the fourth quarter. The implementation of the
    restructuring plan involved the exiting of select markets as
    well as a general reorganization of the Company. As a result,
    the Company recognized restructuring charges of approximately
    $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, associated
    with severance, office closures and the termination of certain
    contractual obligations. Approximately one-third of the
    restructuring charges were non-cash. All related expenses were
    recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008, and an associated
    liability was established for severance charges to be paid in
    the first quarter of 2009.

Real
    Estate Acquisition and Development Activity

During 2008, the Company acquired 10 properties in the Americas,
    Asia and Europe aggregating approximately 2.8 million
    square feet for $217.0 million.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had 53 projects in the
    development pipeline on an owned and managed basis, which are
    expected to total approximately 16.4 million square feet
    and have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion
    upon completion. Four of these projects totaling approximately
    1.4 million square feet with an aggregate estimated
    investment of $80.0 million were held in an unconsolidated
    co-investment venture. The Company had an additional eight
    development projects available for divestiture or contribution
    totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet, with an
    aggregate estimated investment of $264.3 million, net of
    $3.3 million of real estate impairment losses, and an aggregate
    net book value of $258.4 million. As of December 31,
    2008, the Company and its development joint venture partners
    have funded an aggregate of $987.0 million, or 80%, of the
    total estimated investment before the impact of real estate
    investment losses and will need to fund an estimated additional
    $252.0 million, or 20%, in order to complete the
    Company’s development pipeline. The development pipeline,
    at December 31, 2008, included projects expected to be
    completed through the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition to the
    Company’s committed development pipeline, it holds a total
    of 2,424 acres of land for future development or sale,
    approximately 86% of which is located in North America. The
    Company currently estimates that these 2,424 acres of land
    could support approximately 43.9 million square feet of
    future development.

Development
    Profits, Gains from Dispositions of Real Estate Interests and
    Discontinued Operations

Property Divestitures.

During 2008, the
    Company recognized development profits of approximately
    $7.2 million as a result of the sale of six development
    projects, aggregating approximately 73.9 million square
    feet, and two land parcels, aggregating approximately
    95 acres. During 2007, the Company recognized development
    profits of approximately $28.6 million as a result of the
    sale of seven development projects and 76 acres of land.
    During 2006, the Company sold five land parcels and six
    development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million
    square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million,
    resulting in an after-tax gain of $13.5 million. In
    addition, during 2006, the Company received approximately
    $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a
    parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million,
    $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partner’s
    share.

During 2008, the Company recognized development profits of
    approximately $73.9 million, as a result of the
    contribution of 11 completed development projects, aggregating
    approximately 5.2 million square feet, to AMB

    Company recognized an aggregate after-tax gain of
    $93.9 million, representing the portion of its interest in
    the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors
    for cash.

Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate
    Interests.

During 2008, we sold an approximate
    0.1 million square foot industrial operating property for a
    sale price of $3.6 million, with a resulting net gain of
    $0.7 million, and we also recognized a deferred gain of
    approximately $1.1 million on the divestiture of one
    industrial building, aggregating approximately 0.1 million
    square feet, for a price of $3.5 million, which was
    disposed of on December 31, 2007. During 2007, we divested
    ourselves of three industrial properties, aggregating
    approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate
    price of $120.0 million, with a resulting net gain of
    approximately $2.0 million, and sold two value-added
    conversion projects for a gain of approximately
    $60.0 million. During 2006, we divested ourselves of
    39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately
    3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of
    $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of
    $42.6 million.

During 2008, the Company contributed an operating property for
    approximately $66.2 million, aggregating approximately
    0.8 million square feet, into AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. The Company recognized a gain of
    $20.0 million on the contribution, representing the portion
    of its interest in the contributed property acquired by the
    third-party investors for cash. During 2007, the Company
    contributed operating properties for approximately
    $524.9 million, aggregating approximately 4.5 million
    square feet, into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and AMB-SGP Mexico,
    LLC. The Company recognized a gain of $73.4 million on the
    contributions, representing the portion of its interest in the
    contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for
    cash.

Properties Held for Divestiture or
    Contribution.

As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company held for divestiture two properties with an aggregate
    net book value of $8.2 million. These properties either are
    not in the Company’s core markets, do not meet its current
    investment objectives, or are included as part of its
    development-for-sale or value-added conversion programs. The
    divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of
    acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Properties held
    for divestiture are stated at the lower of cost or estimated
    fair value less costs to sell. As of December 31, 2007, the
    Company held for divestiture five properties with an aggregate
    net book value of $40.5 million.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company held for contribution
    to co-investment ventures 20 properties with an aggregate net
    book value of $600.8 million which, when contributed, will
    reduce the Company’s average ownership interest in these
    projects from approximately 96% to an expected range of

15-20%.

As
    of December 31, 2008, properties with an aggregate net book
    value of $100.4 million were reclassified from properties
    held for contribution to investments in real estate as a result
    of the change in management’s expectations regarding the
    launch of a co-investment venture. These properties may be
    reclassified as properties held for contribution at some future
    time. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, as of
    December 31, 2008, the Company recognized additional
    depreciation expense and related accumulated depreciation of
    $2.2 million as a result of the reclassification, as well
    as impairment charges of $21.8 million on real estate
    assets held for divestiture or contribution for which it was
    determined that the carrying value was greater than the

    its property divestitures as discontinued operations separately
    as prescribed under the provisions of SFAS No. 144.
    Beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144 requires the Company
    to separately report as discontinued operations the historical
    operating results attributable to operating properties sold and
    held for disposition and the applicable gain or loss on the
    disposition of the properties, which is included in development
    gains and gains from dispositions of real estate, net of taxes
    and minority interests, in the statement of operations. Although
    the application of SFAS No. 144 may affect the
    presentation of the Company’s results of operations for the
    periods that it has already reported in filings with the SEC,
    there will be no effect on its previously reported financial
    position, net income or cash flows. During 2008, the Company
    sold an approximate 0.1 million square foot industrial
    operating property for a sale price of $3.6 million, with a
    resulting net gain of $0.7 million, and the Company also
    recognized a deferred gain of approximately $1.1 million on
    the divestiture of one industrial building, aggregating
    approximately 0.1 million square feet, for a price of
    $3.5 million, which was disposed of on December 31,
    2007. In addition, during 2008, the Company recognized
    approximately $0.1 million in gains resulting primarily
    from the additional value received from prior dispositions.
    During 2007, the Company divested itself of three industrial
    properties, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square
    feet, and two value-added conversion projects for an aggregate
    price of $120.0 million, with a resulting net gain of
    approximately $2.0 million and a gain of approximately
    $60.0 million, respectively. During 2006, the Company
    divested itself of 17 industrial properties, aggregating
    approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate
    price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of
    $42.6 million.

Wholly-owned
    and Consolidated Joint Venture Debt

Secured debt generally requires monthly principal and interest
    payments. Some of the loans are cross-collateralized by multiple
    properties. The secured debt is collateralized by deeds of trust
    or mortgages on certain properties and is generally
    non-recourse. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31,
    2007, the total gross investment book value of those properties
    securing the debt was $2.1 billion for each period,
    including $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion held in
    consolidated joint ventures, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2008, $936.9 million of the secured debt
    obligations bore interest at fixed rates with a weighted average
    interest rate of 5.8% while the remaining $586.8 million
    bore interest at variable rates (with a weighted average
    interest rate of 2.6%).

On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P.,
    a Delaware limited partnership, which is a subsidiary of the
    Company, entered into a loan agreement for a $305.0 million
    secured financing. On the same day, pursuant to the loan
    agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered four promissory
    notes to the two lenders, each of which matures on March 5,
    2012. One note had an initial principal borrowing of
    $160.0 million and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%.
    The second note had an initial principal borrowing of
    $40.0 million with a variable interest rate of
    81.0 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate. The third
    note had an initial principal borrowing of $84.0 million
    and a fixed interest rate of 5.90%. The fourth note had an
    initial principal borrowing of $21.0 million and bears
    interest at a variable rate of 135.0 basis points above the
    one-month LIBOR rate.

On September 4, 2008, the Operating Partnership entered
    into a $230.0 million secured term loan credit agreement
    that matures on September 4, 2010 and had a weighted
    average interest rate of 4.0% at December 31, 2008. The
    Company is a guarantor of the Operating Partnership’s
    obligations under the term loan facility. The term loan facility
    carries a one-year extension option, which the Operating
    Partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the
    Operating Partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment
    grade, among other things, and can be increased up to
    $300.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was
    130.0 basis points as of December 31, 2008, based on
    the Operating Partnership’s long-term debt rating.
    Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the base rate on the term
    loan was fixed at 2.7% through December 11,

2009 through interest rate swaps. If the Operating
    Partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below current
    levels, the Company’s cost of debt will increase.

Unsecured
    Senior Debt

As of December 31, 2008, the Operating Partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.2 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 6.0% and had an average term of 4.1 years. In May
    2008, the Company sold $325.0 million aggregate principal
    amount of the Operating Partnership’s senior unsecured
    notes under its Series C medium-term note program. The
    Company guarantees the Operating Partnership’s obligations
    with respect to its unsecured senior debt securities. The
    unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various
    covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants,
    including compliance with financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and
    limitations on mergers or consolidations. Management believes
    that the Company and the Operating Partnership were in
    compliance with their financial covenants at December 31,
    2008.

Other
    Debt

In March 2008, the Operating Partnership obtained a
    $325.0 million unsecured term loan facility, which had a
    balance of $325.0 million outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008, with a weighted average interest rate of
    3.5%. In February 2008, the Operating Partnership also obtained
    a $100.0 million unsecured money market loan with a
    weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and subsequently paid off
    the entire balance in June 2008. In June 2008, the Operating
    Partnership obtained a new $100.0 million unsecured loan
    with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and subsequently
    paid off the entire balance in September 2008. The Company
    guarantees the Operating Partnership’s obligations with
    respect to its unsecured debt. The unsecured debt is subject to
    various covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants,
    including compliance with financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios and negative covenants
    including limitations on the incurrance of liens and limitations
    on mergers or  consolidations.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
    $392.8 million outstanding in other debt which bore a
    weighted average interest rate of 3.9% and had an average term
    of 1.2 years. Other debt also includes a $70.0 million
    credit facility obtained on August 24, 2007 by AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P., a subsidiary of the
    Operating Partnership, which had a $50.0 million balance
    outstanding as of December 31, 2008. The Company also had
    $342.8 million outstanding in other debt.

Unsecured
    Credit Facilities

The Operating Partnership has a $550.0 million (includes
    Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollar
    denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility
    which bore a weighted average interest rate of 2.85% at
    December 31, 2008. This facility matures on June 1,
    2010. The Company is a guarantor of the Operating
    Partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The
    line carries a one-year extension option, which the Operating
    Partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the
    Operating Partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment
    grade, among other things, and the facility can be increased up
    to $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was
    42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2008, based on
    the Operating Partnership’s long-term debt rating, with an
    annual facility fee of 15.0 basis points. If the Operating
    Partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below current
    levels, the Company’s cost of debt will increase. If the
    Operating Partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below
    investment grade, the Operating Partnership will be unable to
    request money market loans and borrowings in Euros, Yen or
    British pounds sterling. The four-year credit facility includes
    a multi-currency component, under which up to
    $550.0 million can be drawn in Euros, Yen, British pounds
    sterling or U.S. dollars. The Operating Partnership uses
    the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding
    development activity and general working capital requirements.
    As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on this
    credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on
    December 31, 2008, was $243.1 million and the

remaining amount available was $281.4 million, net of
    outstanding letters of credit of $25.5 million. The credit
    agreement contains affirmative covenants, including compliance
    with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of
    specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including
    limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on
    mergers or consolidations. Management believes that the Company
    and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with their
    financial covenants under this credit agreement at
    December 31, 2008.

AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the Operating
    Partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit
    facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion
    Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on
    December 31, 2008, equaled approximately
    $606.5 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted
    average interest rate of 1.3%. The Company and the Operating
    Partnership guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K.
    under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any
    other entity in which the Operating Partnership directly or
    indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from
    time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit
    agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the
    facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties
    and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South
    Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the
    option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the
    credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in
    entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility
    matures in June 2010 and has a one-year extension option, which
    the Operating Partnership may exercise at its sole option so
    long as the Operating Partnership’s long-term debt rating
    is investment grade, among other things. The extension option is
    also subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions and
    the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the
    outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The
    rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which
    was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2008, based
    on the credit rating of the Operating Partnership’s
    long-term debt. If the Operating Partnership’s long-term
    debt ratings fall below current levels, the Company’s cost
    of debt will increase. In addition, there is an annual facility
    fee, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of
    the Operating Partnership’s long-term debt, and was
    15.0 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the
    facility as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31,
    2008, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the
    exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2008, was
    $342.2 million, and the remaining amount available was
    $264.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and
    limitations on mergers or consolidations. Management believes
    that the Company, the Operating Partnership and AMB Japan
    Finance Y.K. were in compliance with their financial covenants
    under this credit agreement at December 31, 2008.

On July 16, 2007, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and the
    Operating Partnership, each acting as a borrower, and the
    Company and the Operating Partnership, as guarantors, entered
    into a fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement for
    a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that
    replaced the existing $250.0 million unsecured revolving
    credit facility. The fifth amended and restated credit facility
    amends the fourth amended and restated credit facility to, among
    other things, increase the facility amount to
    $500.0 million with an option to further increase the
    facility to $750.0 million, to extend the maturity date to
    July 2011 and to allow for borrowing in Indian rupees. The
    Company and the Operating Partnership guarantee the obligations
    for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the
    Operating Partnership that are selected by the Operating
    Partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant
    to their credit facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit
    facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the
    borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility
    includes a multi-currency component under which up to
    $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong
    dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds
    sterling, and Euros with the ability to add Indian rupees. The
    line, which matures in July 2011, carries a one-year extension
    option, which the Operating Partnership may exercise at its sole
    option so long as the Operating Partnership’s long-term
    debt rating is investment grade, among other things, and can be
    increased up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions and
    the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the
    outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally
    LIBOR plus a margin, which was 60.0 basis points as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the credit rating of the
    Operating Partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt,
    with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the
    Operating Partnership’s senior unsecured

long-term debt. If the Operating Partnership’s long-term
    debt ratings fall below current levels, the Company’s cost
    of debt will increase. If the Operating Partnership’s
    long-term debt ratings fall below investment grade, the
    Operating Partnership will be unable to request borrowings in
    any currency other than U.S. dollars. The borrowers intend to
    use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and
    development of properties and general working capital
    requirements. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding
    balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rates in
    effect at December 31, 2008, was approximately
    $335.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of
    2.74%, and the remaining amount available was
    $164.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios by the Operating
    Partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on
    the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or
    consolidations. Management believes that the Company and the
    Operating Partnership were in compliance with their financial
    covenants under this credit agreement at December 31, 2008.

On June 12, 2007, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS assumed,
    and the Operating Partnership was released from, all of the
    Operating Partnership’s obligations and liabilities under a
    328.0 million Euro facility agreement. On June 12,
    2007, there were 267.0 million Euros (approximately
    $355.2 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange
    rate at June 12, 2007) of term loans and no
    acquisition loans outstanding under the facility agreement.

As a result of the current market conditions, the cost and
    availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely
    affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Company’s total consolidated
    debt maturities for 2009 were $798.0 million. Subsequent to
    December 31, 2008, the Company extended the maturity date
    of the $325.0 million unsecured term loan facility until
    September 2010 and retired the $132.0 million outstanding
    as of December 31, 2008 on the AMB Japan Fund I
    subscription facility, which matured in 2009, and terminated the
    facility.

If the Company is unable to refinance or extend principal
    payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other
    capital transactions, then its cash flow may be insufficient to
    pay cash dividends to its stockholders in all years and to repay
    debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or
    other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance
    of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in
    higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest
    expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.
    This increased interest expense would adversely affect the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash
    flow and ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, and
    the market price of its stock.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
    $223.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, held in
    accounts managed by third party financial institutions and
    consisting of invested cash and cash in the Company’s
    operating accounts. In addition, the Company had
    $710.2 million available for future borrowings under its
    three multicurrency lines of credit at December 31, 2008.
    In the event that the Company does not have sufficient cash
    available to it through its operations or under its lines of
    credit to continue operating its business as usual, the Company
    may need to find alternative ways to increase its liquidity.
    Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting the
    Company of properties; issuing and selling the Company’s
    debt and equity in public or private transactions; entering into
    leases with the Company’s customers at lower rental rates
    or less than optimal terms; or entering into lease renewals with
    its existing customers without an increase in rental rates at
    turnover.

If the long-term debt ratings of the Operating Partnership fall
    below current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under the
    Company’s unsecured credit facilities and certain term
    loans may increase. In addition, if the long-term debt ratings
    of the Operating Partnership fall below investment grade, the
    Operating Partnership may be unable to request borrowings in
    currencies other than U.S. dollars or Japanese Yen, as
    applicable; however, the lack of other currency borrowings does
    not affect the Operating Partnership’s ability to fully
    draw down under the credit facilities or term loans. While the
    Company currently does not expect the Operating
    Partnership’s long-term debt ratings to fall below
    investment grade, in the event that its ratings do fall below
    those levels, the Operating Partnership will be unable to
    exercise its unilateral options to extend the term of its credit
    facilities or its $230.0 million secured term loan credit
    agreement (and its borrowing costs may increase), and the loss
    of its ability to borrow in currencies other

than U.S. dollars or Japanese Yen could affect its ability
    to optimally hedge its borrowings against foreign currency
    exchange rate changes.

As of December 31, 2008, the scheduled maturities and

    statements of operations. Some leases contain options to renew.

8.

Income
    Taxes

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code,
    commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1997.
    To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of
    organizational and operational requirements, including a
    requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its
    taxable income to its stockholders. While historically the
    Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making
    cash distributions to its stockholders, the Company may choose
    to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or
    other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own
    stock. It is management’s current intention to adhere to
    these requirements and maintain the Company’s REIT status.
    As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to
    corporate level federal income tax on net income it distributes
    currently to its stockholders. As such, no provision for federal
    income taxes has been included in the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT
    in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes
    at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative
    minimum tax) and may be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four
    subsequent taxable years. Even if the Company qualifies for
    taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state
    and local taxes on its income and excise taxes on its
    undistributed taxable income. The Company is required to pay
    federal and state income tax on its net taxable income, if any,
    from the activities conducted by the Company’s taxable REIT
    subsidiaries. Foreign income taxes are accrued for foreign
    countries in which the Company operates, as necessary.

In connection with its decision to curtail development
    activities, as of December 31, 2008, the Company incurred
    charges of approximately $5.0 million to establish a
    reserve against tax assets associated with a reduction in
    development, which is recorded in general and administrative
    expense on the consolidated statement of operations. The Company
    is required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax
    assets if it is determined, based on available evidence at the
    time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not
    that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized. As of December 31, 2008, the Company concluded,
    based on a review of the relative weight of the available
    evidence, that it was more likely than not that it would not
    generate sufficient future taxable income to realize all of its
    deferred tax assets.

The following is a reconciliation of net income available to
    common stockholders to taxable income available to common
    stockholders for the years ended December 31 (dollars in

Minority
    Interests

Minority interests in the Company represent the limited
    partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, limited
    partnership interests in AMB Property II, L.P., a Delaware
    limited partnership, and interests held by certain third parties
    in several real estate joint ventures, aggregating approximately
    22.3 million square feet, which are consolidated for
    financial reporting purposes. The Company determines
    consolidation based on standards set forth in FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB
    No. 51

(FIN 46), or EITF Issue

No. 04-5

(EITF 04-5),

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights,

and

SOP 78-9,

Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures.

Based
    on the guidance set forth in

EITF 04-5,

the Company consolidates certain joint venture investments
    because it exercises significant control over major operating
    decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property
    managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in
    financing. The Company is the general partner (or equivalent of
    a general partner in entities not structured as partnerships) in
    a number of its consolidated joint venture investments. In all
    such cases, the limited partners in such investments (or
    equivalent of limited partners in such investments which are not
    structured as partnerships) do not have rights described in

EITF 04-5,

which would preclude consolidation. The Company consolidates
    certain other joint ventures where it is not the general partner
    (or equivalent of a general partner in entities not structured
    as partnerships) because it has control over those entities
    through majority ownership, retention of the majority of
    economics, and a combination of substantive kick-out rights

and/or

substantive participating rights. These joint venture
    investments do not meet the variable interest entity criteria
    under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of
    Variable Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB
    No. 51

.

Effective October 1, 2006, the Company deconsolidated AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended
    co-investment partnership formed in 2004 with institutional
    investors, on a prospective basis, due to the re-evaluation of
    the Company’s accounting for its investment in the fund
    because of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the
    general partner’s rights.

Through the Operating Partnership, the Company enters into joint
    ventures with institutional investors. The Company’s
    consolidated joint ventures are engaged in the acquisition,
    ownership, operation, management and, in some cases, the
    renovation, expansion and development of industrial buildings in
    target markets in the Americas.

    approximately 4.2 million square feet of operating
    properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of
    completed development projects to this co-investment venture for
    approximately $799.3 million (using the exchange rates on
    the dates of contribution).

Under the agreements governing the co-investment ventures, the
    Company and the other parties to the co-investment ventures may
    be required to make additional capital contributions and,
    subject to certain limitations, the co-investment ventures may
    incur additional debt.

AMB Pier One, LLC, is a joint venture related to the 2000
    redevelopment of the pier which holds the Company’s global
    headquarters in San Francisco, California. On June 30,

    equity interest from an unrelated third party, based on the fair
    market value as stipulated in the joint venture agreement in AMB
    Pier One, LLC, for a nominal amount. As a result, the investment
    was consolidated as of June 30, 2007.

In August 2008, a subsidiary of the Company sold its approximate
    5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund, a Canadian
    income trust specializing in aviation-related real estate at
    Canada’s international airports, as part of a tender offer
    for interests in the income trust. This equity investment of
    approximately $2.1 million (valued as of December 31,
    2007) was included in other assets on the consolidated
    balance sheets as of December 31, 2007.

Stock
    Incentive Plan, 401(k) Plan and Deferred Compensation
    Plan

Stock Incentive Plans.

The Company has stock
    option and incentive plans (“Stock Incentive Plans”)
    for the purpose of attracting and retaining eligible officers,
    directors and employees. The Company has authorized for issuance
    17,500,000 shares of common stock under its 2002 stock
    incentive plan of which 8,447,215 shares were remaining
    available for grant and 5,014,617 shares were reserved for
    issuance at December 31, 2008. As of December 31,
    2008, the Company had 6,206,678 non-qualified options
    outstanding granted to certain directors, officers and employees
    which includes 1,192,061 shares of common stock reserved
    for issuance for outstanding option grants under its 1997 stock
    incentive plan which expired in November 2007. Each option is
    exchangeable for one share of the Company’s common stock.
    Each option’s exercise price is equal to the Company’s
    market price on the date of grant. The options have an original
    ten-year term and generally vest pro rata in annual installments
    over a three to five-year period from the date of grant.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R,

Share Based
    Payment,

on January 1, 2006. The Company opted to
    utilize the modified prospective method of transition in
    adopting SFAS No. 123R. The effect of this change from
    applying the original expense recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

, had an immaterial effect on income before
    minority interests and discontinued operations, income from
    continuing operations, net income and earnings per share. The
    effect of this change from applying the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 had no effect on cash flow from operating
    and financing activities. The Company recorded a cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of
    $0.2 million as of January 1, 2006 to reflect the
    change in accounting for forfeitures. The Company values stock
    options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and
    recognizes this value as an expense over the vesting periods.
    Under this standard, recognition of expense for stock options is
    applied to all options granted after the beginning of the year
    of adoption. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, the
    Company will recognize the associated expense over the three to
    five-year vesting periods. Additionally, the Company awards
    restricted stock and recognizes this value as an expense over
    the vesting periods. As of December 31, 2008, the Company
    had $5.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested options granted under the Stock Incentive
    Plans which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
    period of 1.77 years. Results for prior periods have not
    been restated.

The following table summarizes stock option expense and

SFAS No. 123R requires the cash flows resulting from
    tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the
    compensation cost recognized for those options (excess tax
    benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. The Company
    does not have any such excess tax benefits.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company uses historical
    data to estimate option exercise and forfeitures within the
    valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on historical
    volatility of the Company’s stock. The risk-free rate for
    periods within the expected life of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the
    grant.

As of December 31, 2008, there was $30.7 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested
    share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Stock
    Incentive Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 2.53 years. The total fair value
    of shares vested, based on the market price on the vesting date,
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $12.5 million, $12.5 million and $17.4 million,
    respectively.

401(k) Plan.

In November 1997, the Company
    established a Section 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan
    (the “401(k) Plan”), which is a continuation of the
    401(k) Plan of the Company’s predecessor, to cover eligible
    employees of the Company. During the first quarter of 2007 and
    2006, the 401(k) Plan permitted eligible employees to defer up
    to 20% of their annual compensation (as adjusted under the terms
    of the 401(k) Plan), subject to certain limitations imposed by
    the Code. During the remainder of 2007 and in 2008, the
    percentage of compensation that may be deferred was increased to
    75%. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company matched employee
    contributions under the 401(k) Plan in an amount equal to 50% of
    the first 6.0% of annual compensation deferred by each

employee, up to a maximum match of $6,900, $6,750 and $6,600 per
    year, respectively, for each participating employee. In the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company
    made matching contributions of $1.1 million,
    $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The
    Company may also make discretionary contributions to the 401(k)
    Plan. No discretionary contributions were made by the Company to
    the 401(k) Plan in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006.

The employees’ elective deferrals are immediately vested
    and non-forfeitable upon contribution to the 401(k) Plan.
    Matching contributions made by the Company vest fully one year
    after the commencement of an employee’s employment with the
    Company.

Deferred Compensation Plans.

The Company has
    established two non-qualified deferred compensation plans for
    eligible officers and directors of the Company and certain of
    its affiliates, which enable eligible participants to defer
    income from their U.S. payroll up to 100% of annual base
    pay, up to 100% of annual bonuses, up to 100% of their meeting
    fees

and/or

committee chairmanship fees, and up to 100% of certain
    equity-based compensation, as applicable, subject to
    restrictions, on a pre-tax basis. This deferred compensation is
    an unsecured obligation of the Company. The Company may make
    discretionary matching contributions to participant accounts at
    any time. The Company made no such discretionary matching
    contributions in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006. The participant’s elective deferrals and any
    matching contributions are immediately 100% vested. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the total fair value of
    compensation deferred was $53.1 million and
    $100.9 million, respectively.

Lease Commitments.

The Company has entered
    into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily
    on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms
    of 1 to 54 years. Buildings and improvements subject to
    ground leases are depreciated ratably over the lesser of the
    terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum

Standby Letters of Credit.

As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had provided approximately
    $32.7 million in letters of credit, of which
    $25.5 million was provided under the Operating
    Partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit
    facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under
    certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other
    commitments.

Guarantees and Contribution
    Obligations.

Excluding parent guarantees
    associated with debt or contribution obligations as discussed in
    Notes 6 and 10, as of December 31, 2008, the Company
    had outstanding guarantees and contribution obligations in the
    aggregate amount of $639.9 million as described below.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding bank
    guarantees in the amount of $27.8 million used to secure
    contingent obligations, primarily obligations under development
    and purchase agreements, including $0.7 million guaranteed
    under a purchase agreement entered into by an unconsolidated
    joint venture. As of December 31, 2008, the Company also
    guaranteed $49.6 million and $231.8 million on
    outstanding loans for six of its consolidated joint ventures and
    four of its unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively.

Also, the Company has entered into contribution agreements with
    its unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These contribution
    agreements require the Company to make additional capital
    contributions to the applicable co-investment venture upon
    certain defaults by the co-investment venture of certain of its
    debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital
    contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than the Company’s share of the co-investment
    venture’s debt obligation or the value of its share of any
    property securing such debt. The Company’s contribution
    obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the
    amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the
    property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the
    lender upon default. The Company’s potential obligations
    under these contribution agreements total $260.6 million as
    of December 31, 2008.

On May 30, 2008, the Operating Partnership entered into a
    142.0 million Euros

364-day

multi-currency revolving facility agreement (approximately
    $198.4 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange
    rate at December 31, 2008) and related guarantee as
    loan guarantor with the Company’s affiliate AMB
    Fund Management S.à.r.l. on behalf of AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, certain of the Company’s European
    affiliates, ING Real Estate Finance N.V. and certain of its
    European affiliates as lenders and ING Real Estate Finance N.V.
    as facility agent. The facility agreement provided that certain
    of the affiliates of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS may borrow
    unsecured loans in an aggregate amount of up to
    142.0 million Euros (approximately $198.4 million in
    U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31,
    2008) all of which were repayable 364 days after the
    date of the facility agreement (unless otherwise agreed). All
    amounts owed under the facility agreement were guaranteed by the
    Operating Partnership.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

AMB Fund Management S.á.r.l. on behalf of AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS indemnified the Operating Partnership for
    all of its obligations under the guarantee.

On December 29, 2008, the Operating Partnership terminated
    the facility agreement and related guarantee. Prior to the
    termination of the facility agreement, four of the
    Company’s European affiliates that were subsidiaries of AMB
    Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS holding real property interests in
    Germany were borrowers under such facility agreement. The
    outstanding borrowed amount of the Company’s European
    affiliate borrowers under such facility agreement was repaid in
    full on December 29, 2008. In connection with the payment
    in full under, and the termination of, this facility agreement,
    the Company’s European affiliate borrowers

and/or

their
    affiliates borrowed funds under an existing credit facility held
    by AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, and entered new

5-year

term
    loans with the lender in the aggregate amount of
    50.2 million Euros (approximately $70.1 in
    U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of
    December 31, 2008) under such facility. The borrowed
    funds were used to repay the outstanding amounts under the
    terminated 142.0 million Euros credit facility. The
    European affiliate borrowers are in the process of granting
    security interests to the lender, as the security agent, under
    and in accordance with the terms of such facility, all of which
    security interests are expected to become effective in the first
    half of 2009. The Operating Partnership has agreed to guarantee
    the 50.2 million Euros amount borrowed under such existing
    credit facility only until the security interests are granted,
    at which time the guarantees will be extinguished.

Performance and Surety Bonds.

As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding performance
    and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $17.8 million.
    These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its
    development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax
    obligations and the construction of certain real property
    improvements and infrastructure. The performance and surety
    bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due
    or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure.

Promote Interests and Other Contractual
    Obligations.

Upon the achievement of certain
    return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, the
    Company may be obligated to make payments to certain of its
    joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of
    their contractual agreements with the Operating Partnership.
    From time to time in the normal course of the Company’s
    business, the Company enters into various contracts with third
    parties that may obligate it to make payments, pay promotes or
    perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.

Contingencies

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Company may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a
    material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters.

The Company monitors
    its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic
    substances. The Company is not aware of any environmental
    liability with respect to the properties that would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business, assets
    or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance
    that such a material environmental liability does not exist. The
    existence of any such material environmental liability would
    have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations and cash flow. The Company carries environmental
    insurance and believes that the policy terms, conditions, limits
    and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the
    circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the cost of such
    coverage and current industry practice.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Company carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood and terrorism
    insurance. The Company believes that the policy terms,
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and current industry practice. In
    addition, a significant number of the Company’s properties
    are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. As
    a result, the Company has obtained limited earthquake insurance
    on those properties. There

F-42


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as
    those due to acts of war, that may be either uninsurable or not
    economically insurable. Although the Company has obtained
    coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that it believes are
    commercially reasonable, there can be no assurance that the
    Company will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Company could lose its investment in,
    and anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property.

Captive Insurance Company.

The Company has a
    wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata National
    Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for
    all or a portion of losses below the attachment point of the
    Company’s third-party insurance policies. The captive
    insurance company is one element of the Company’s overall
    risk management program. The Company capitalized Arcata in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    establishes annual premiums based on projections derived from
    the past loss experience at the Company’s properties. Like
    premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid
    to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific
    lease terms. Through this structure, the Company believes that
    it has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower
    cost than would otherwise be available in the market.

Segment
    Information

The segment information for 2006 has been reclassified to
    conform to current presentation.

The Company has two lines of business: real estate operations
    and private capital. Real estate operations is comprised of
    various segments while private capital consists of a single
    segment, on which the Company evaluates its performance:

•

Real Estate Operations.

The Company operates
    industrial properties and manages its business by geographic
    markets. Such industrial properties are typically comprised of
    multiple distribution warehouse facilities suitable for single
    or multiple customers who are engaged in various types of
    businesses. The geographic markets where the Company owns
    industrial properties are managed separately because it believes
    each market has its own economic characteristics and requires
    its own operating, pricing and leasing strategies. Each market
    is considered to be an individual operating segment. The
    accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The
    Company evaluates performance based upon property net operating
    income of the combined properties in each segment, which are
    listed below. In addition, the Company’s development
    business is included under real estate operations. It primarily
    consists of the Company’s development of real estate
    properties that are subsequently contributed to a co-investment
    venture fund in which the Company has an ownership interest and
    for which the Company acts as manager, or that are sold to third
    parties. The Company evaluates performance of the development
    business by reported operating segment based upon gains
    generated from the disposition

and/or

contribution of real estate. The assets of the development
    business generally include properties under development and land
    held for development. During the period between the completion
    of development of a property and the date the property is
    contributed to an unconsolidated co-investment venture or sold
    to a third party, the property and its associated rental income
    and property operating costs are included in the real estate
    operations segment because the primary activity associated with
    the property during that period is leasing. Upon contribution or
    sale, the resulting gain or loss is included as gains from sale
    or contribution of real estate interests or development profits,
    as appropriate.

•

Private Capital.

The Company, through its
    private capital group, AMB Capital Partners, LLC (“AMB
    Capital Partners”), provides real estate investment,
    portfolio management and reporting services to co-investment
    ventures and clients. The private capital income earned consists
    of acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and
    priority distributions, and promote interests and incentive
    distributions from the Company’s co-investment ventures and
    AMB Capital Partners’ clients. With respect to the
    Company’s U.S. and Mexico funds and co-investment
    ventures, the Company typically earns a 90.0 basis points
    acquisition fee on the acquisition cost of third party
    acquisitions, asset management priority distributions of 7.5% of
    net operating income on stabilized properties, 70.0 basis
    points of total projected costs as asset management fees on
    renovation or development properties, and incentive
    distributions of 15% of the return over a 9% internal rate of
    return and 20% of the return over a 12% internal rate of return
    to investors on a periodic basis or at the end of a fund’s
    life. In Japan, the Company earns a 90.0 basis points
    acquisition fee on the acquisition cost of third party
    acquisitions, asset management priority distributions of 1.5% of
    65% of the committed equity during the investment period and
    then 1.5% of unreturned equity, and incentive distributions of
    20% of the return over a 10% internal rate of return and 25% of
    the return over a 13% internal rate of return to investors at
    the end of a fund’s life. In Europe, the Company earns a
    90.0 basis points acquisition fee on the acquisition cost
    of third party acquisitions, asset management fees of
    75.0 basis points on the gross asset value of the fund, and
    incentive distributions of 20% of the return over a 9% internal
    rate of return and 25% of the return over a 12% internal rate of
    return to investors on a periodic basis. The accounting policies
    of the segment are the same as those described in the summary of
    significant accounting policies under Note 2. The Company
    evaluates performance based upon private capital income.

(1)

The markets included in U.S. markets are a subset of the
    Company’s regions defined as East, Southwest and West
    Central in the Americas. Japan is a part of the Company’s
    Asia region.

(2)

Property net operating income (“NOI”) is defined as
    rental revenue, including reimbursements, less property
    operating expenses, which excludes depreciation, amortization,
    general and administrative expenses and interest expense. For a
    reconciliation of NOI to net income, see the table below.

The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate and useful
    supplemental performance measure because NOI reflects the
    operating performance of the Company’s real estate
    portfolio on a segment basis, and the Company uses NOI to make
    decisions about resource allocations and to assess regional
    property level performance. However, NOI should not be viewed as
    an alternative measure of the Company’s financial
    performance since it does not reflect general and administrative
    expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs
    and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction
    activities that could materially impact the Company’s
    results from operations. Further, the Company’s NOI may not
    be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they
    may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.

    results of their operations and their cash flows for the year

    accepted in the United States of America. These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Partnership’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2008

1.

ORGANIZATION

On September 17, 2003, AMB Property, L.P. formed AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, LLC (“Alliance
    Fund III, LLC”), a Delaware limited liability company.
    On October 25, 2004, AMB converted Alliance Fund III,
    LLC into a limited partnership, AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. (“Fund III”), a Delaware
    limited partnership, and admitted AMB Institutional Alliance
    REIT III, Inc. (“REIT III”) into Fund III as a
    limited partner. Due to the related party nature of the
    conversion, and that Fund III was under common control with
    Alliance Fund III, LLC, the assets and liabilities were
    accounted for by Fund III at historical cost.

On October 26, 2004 (“Inception”), Fund III
    completed its first closing and accepted capital contributions
    from AMB Property, L.P. and REIT III. On November 1, 2006,
    AMB Property II, L.P. (collectively with AMB Property, L.P.,
    “AMB”) was admitted to Fund III as a limited
    partner in exchange for a contribution of 16 industrial
    buildings with an estimated value of $111.9 million. On
    July 1, 2008, the City and County of San Francisco
    Employees’ Retirement System (“CCSFERS”) and AMB
    contributed their partnership interests in AMB Partners II, L.P.
    (“Partners II”) to Fund III in exchange for
    partnership interests in Fund III. As of December 31,
    2008, Fund III has accepted capital contributions from AMB,
    CCSFERS and REIT III (excluding AMB Property, L.P.’s
    interest), and contributions resulting from Fund III’s
    dividend reinvestment program, for ownership interests in
    Fund III of 19.4 percent, 25.5 percent and
    55.1 percent, respectively. AMB is a general and limited
    partner of Fund III. As of December 31, 2008, all capital
    balances reflect balances at liquidation.

As of December 31, 2008, $56.6 million of REIT III
    units in Fund III have been redeemed.

As of December 31, 2008, Fund III owned 128 operating
    properties and one renovation property (consisting of 310
    industrial buildings aggregating 37.0 million square feet
    (unaudited)) and one parcel of land held for future development
    (the “Properties”). The Properties are located in the
    following markets: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore/Washington DC,
    Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, Northern New
    Jersey/New York, Orlando, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle,
    South Florida, and Southern California.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of Fund III and the ventures in
    which Fund III has a controlling interest. Third party
    equity interests in Fund III’s ventures are reflected
    as minority interests in the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements. All significant intercompany amounts have been
    eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of Fund III’s long-lived assets could occur in
    the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent
    that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount
    of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to

    INSTITUTIONAL ALLIANCE FUND III, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

income and is included on the consolidated statements of
    operations. As a result of the economic environment, the
    management of Fund III re-evaluated the carrying value of
    its investments and recorded impairment charges of
    $8.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local airport
    authorities, and subject to ground leases are depreciated over
    the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the
    underlying ground lease. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building costs on ground leases

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof /HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in property including
    legal fees and acquisition costs. Project costs associated with
    the development and construction of a real estate project, which
    include interest and property taxes, are capitalized as
    construction in progress. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, Fund III capitalized interest and property taxes of
    approximately $0.3 million.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

Fund III records at acquisition an intangible asset or
    liability for the value attributable to above- or below-market
    leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2008, Fund III has recorded intangible
    assets or liabilities in the amounts of $12.6 million,
    $42.1 million, $37.8 million, and $73.6 million
    for the value attributable to above-market leases, below-market
    leases, in- place leases, and lease origination costs,
    respectively, which are included in buildings and improvements
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Fund III also records at acquisition an asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market assumed
    mortgage loans payable. As of December 31, 2008,
    Fund III has recorded $0.9 million for net above- and
    below-market assumed mortgage loans payable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with reserves from loan proceeds
    for certain capital improvements and real estate tax payments.
    Restricted cash also includes cash held by third parties as
    collateral for certain letters of credit. As of
    December 31, 2008, Fund III had two letters of credit
    outstanding totaling $0.2 million.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related mortgage loans payable. As of
    December 31, 2008, deferred financing costs were
    $9.2 million, net of accumulated amortization.

Mortgage Premiums and Discounts.

Mortgage
    premiums and discounts represent the difference between the fair
    value of debt and the principal value of debt assumed in
    connection with acquisitions. The mortgage premiums and
    discounts are being amortized into interest expense over the
    term of the related debt instrument using the effective-interest
    method. As of December 31, 2008, the net unamortized
    mortgage discounts were approximately $4.4 million.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent interests held by an affiliate of AMB and third-party
    investors in various Fund III entities. Such investments
    are consolidated because Fund III owns a majority interest
    and exercises control through the ability to control major
    operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    Fund III are allocated to each of the partners in
    accordance with the partnership agreement. Partner distributions
    are made quarterly. Distributions, other than priority
    distributions (Note 8), are paid or accrued to each of the
    partners in accordance with their respective partnership units
    owned at the time distributions are declared.

On January 1, 2005, Fund III issued 125 Series A
    preferred units at a price of $1,000 per unit, which are held by
    REIT III. REIT III in turn issued 125 shares of
    Series A preferred stock at a price of $1,000 per share.
    The Series A preferred stock is 12.5 percent
    cumulative non-voting preferred stock, callable with a premium
    based on the period of time the stock has been outstanding. The
    call premium was 15.0 percent through December 31,
    2007. The premium will reduce each year thereafter by
    5.0 percent per year such that there will be no premium
    after December 31, 2009. Dividends are payable on June 30
    and December 31 of each year.

Rental Revenues.

Fund III, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. In addition, Fund III nets its bad debt
    expense against rental income for financial reporting purposes.
    Such amounts totaled approximately $0.9 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. Fund III recorded net
    $3.7 million of income related to amortization of lease
    intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2008. Of the
    net $3.7 million recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, $3.0 million relates to
    amortization expense of above-market leases and
    $6.7 million relates to amortization income of below-market
    leases, respectively. The lease intangibles are being amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with Fund III in
    its trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to
    occupy space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on Fund III’s ability to lease space
    and on the level of rent that can be achieved. As of
    December 31, 2008, Fund III did not have any material
    concentration of credit risk due to the diversification of its
    tenants.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

As of
    December 31, 2008, Fund III’s consolidated
    financial instruments include mortgage loans payable, a secured
    credit facility and an unsecured credit facility. Based on
    borrowing rates available to Fund III at December 31,
    2008, the estimated fair value of the mortgage loans payable,
    secured credit facility and unsecured credit facility was
    $1.7 billion.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In December
    2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141(R),

Business
    Combinations

, which changes the accounting for business
    combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued
    in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of
    contingent consideration, the accounting for preacquisition gain
    and loss contingencies, the accounting for acquisition-related
    restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of
    acquisition-related transaction costs and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.
    Fund III is in the process of evaluating the impact that
    the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows, but,
    at a minimum, it will require the expensing of transaction costs.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51

,
    which clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary
    is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should
    be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.
    This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15,

2008. Fund III is in the process of evaluating the impact
    that the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on its
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement No.

, which requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures
    about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under Statement No. 133 and
    its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
    SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
    Fund III is in the process of evaluating the impact of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 161.

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Fund III
    acquired 141 industrial buildings totaling
    15,657,271 square feet (unaudited). The total aggregate
    investment was approximately $1.4 billion, which includes
    approximately $6.4 million in closing costs and acquisition
    fees related to these acquisitions. The $1.3 billion total
    purchase price related to these acquisitions was allocated
    $480.8 million to land, $817.9 million to buildings
    and improvements, $9.1 million to in-place leases,
    $39.6 million to lease origination costs, $5.2 million
    to above-market lease assets, $4.0 million to below-market
    lease liabilities, and $0.5 million to a below-market
    assumed mortgage loan payable.

4.

DEBT

As of December 31, 2008, Fund III had an unsecured
    revolving credit facility providing for loans in an initial
    principal amount outstanding of up to $110.0 million.
    Fund III guarantees the obligations under the credit
    facility pursuant to the revolving credit agreement.
    Fund III intends to use the facility to finance its real
    estate acquisition activity. The credit facility matures in
    December 2011 and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus
    160 basis points (2.0 percent at December 31,
    2008). In addition, there is an annual administration fee of
    $20,000 per year, payable quarterly in arrears. As of
    December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on this credit
    facility was $40.0 million. The credit facility contains
    customary and other affirmative covenants and negative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specific ratios. The management of Fund III
    believes that it was in compliance with these financial
    covenants at December 31, 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Fund III
    obtained a secured credit facility providing for loans in an
    initial principal amount outstanding of up to
    $65.0 million. The credit facility is secured by a pledge
    of the equity in AMB Mosaic Properties, LLC. The secured credit
    facility matures in September 2015 and bears interest at a rate
    of LIBOR plus 190 basis points (2.3 percent at
    December 31, 2008). As of December 31, 2008, the
    outstanding balance on this secured credit facility was
    $26.1 million. The credit facility contains customary and
    other affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including
    financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specific
    ratios. The management of Fund III believes that it was in
    compliance with these financial covenants at December 31,
    2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Fund III
    obtained 16 mortgage loans payable totaling $510.1 million.
    These loans bear interest at a weighted average rate of
    5.94 percent and mature between 2010 and 2018.

In conjunction with the contribution of Partners II,
    Fund III assumed 25 mortgage loans payable totaling
    $379.4 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.96 percent and mature between 2009 and
    2024.

As of December 31, 2008, Fund III had 74 mortgage
    loans payable totaling $1.8 billion, not including net
    unamortized mortgage discounts of approximately
    $4.4 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.55 percent and mature between 2009 and
    2024.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

The mortgage loans payable are collateralized by certain of the
    Properties and require monthly interest and principal payments
    until maturity. Certain of the mortgage loans payable are
    cross-collateralized. In addition, the mortgage loans payable
    have various covenants. Management of Fund III believes
    that Fund III was in compliance with these covenants at
    December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, certain Fund III mortgage
    loans payable require the existence of Special Purpose Entities
    (“SPEs”) whose sole purposes are to own AMB Baltimore
    Beltway, the AMB Mosaic properties, AMB Palmetto, AMB Spruce
    Avenue, AMB Zuma Distribution Center, Boston Marine, JFK
    Logistics Center, LAX Gateway and SEA Logistics Center 2,
    properties that collateralize 11 mortgage loans payable. All
    SPEs are consolidated in Fund III’s consolidated
    financial statements. The creditors of the SPEs do not have
    recourse to any other assets or revenues of Fund III or to
    AMB or its affiliated entities. Conversely, the creditors of AMB
    and its affiliated entities do not have recourse to any of the
    assets or revenues of the SPEs.

The scheduled principal payments of Fund III’s
    mortgage loans payable, secured credit facility and unsecured
    credit facility as of December 31, 2008 were as follows:

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, AMB receives
    acquisition fees equal to 0.9 percent of the acquisition
    cost of properties acquired. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, Fund III paid AMB acquisition fees
    of approximately $1.6 million. Acquisition fees are
    capitalized and included in investments in real estate in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

At certain properties, AMB is responsible for the property
    management or the accounting or both. On a monthly basis, AMB
    earns property management fees between 0.35 percent and
    3.50 percent of the respective property’s cash
    receipts. On a monthly basis, AMB earns accounting fees between
    0.15 percent and 1.20 percent of the respective
    property’s cash receipts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, AMB earned property management and
    accounting fees of approximately $3.1 million.

At certain properties, AMB earns a leasing commission when it
    has acted as the listing broker or the procuring broker or both.
    For the year ended December 31, 2008, AMB earned leasing
    commissions of approximately $0.2 million.

On a quarterly basis, AMB, as general partner, receives priority
    distributions of 7.5 percent of net operating income
    (excluding straight-line rents, straight-line ground rent
    expense, and amortization of lease intangibles) for providing
    asset management services to Fund III. AMB earned approximately
    $12.2 million in priority distributions for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, AMB owed
    Fund III $0.1 million in operating

    (Continued)

cash flow distributions, priority distributions, and other
    miscellaneous items, which is included in accounts receivable
    and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

For renovation properties, AMB earns a quarterly fee equal to
    0.70 percent per annum of the respective property’s
    acquisition cost (as defined). Such renovation fees are payable
    in arrears over the property’s initial renovation period
    (as defined). For the year ended December 31, 2008, AMB
    earned renovation fees of $12,000. Such renovation fees are
    capitalized and are included in investments in real estate in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Commencing June 30, 2008 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2008, an incentive distribution of $39.3 million has been
    earned by AMB.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include
    liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, accrued but
    unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to $2.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, Fund III may be involved in legal
    actions relating to the ownership and operations of its
    Properties. Management does not expect that the liabilities, if
    any, that may ultimately result from such legal actions would
    have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows of Fund III.

Environmental Matters.

Fund III follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. Fund III is not aware of
    any environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on Fund III’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on Fund III’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

Fund III
    carries property and rental loss, liability, flood,
    environmental and terrorism insurance. Fund III believes
    that the policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are
    adequate and appropriate under the circumstances, given the
    relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry
    practice. In addition, certain of Fund III’s
    properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
    activity; therefore, Fund III has obtained limited
    earthquake insurance on those properties. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts
    of war that may be either uninsurable or not economically
    insurable. Although Fund III has obtained coverage for
    certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and
    insured limits

S-19


AMB
    INSTITUTIONAL ALLIANCE FUND III, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

that Fund III believes are commercially reasonable, it is
    not certain that Fund III will be able to collect under
    such policies. Should an uninsured loss occur, Fund III
    could lose its investment in, and anticipated profits and cash
    flows from, a property. AMB has adopted certain policies with
    respect to insurance coverage and proceeds as part of its
    operating policies, which apply to properties owned or managed
    by AMB, including properties owned by Fund III.

10.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

On February 4, 2009, two properties were added to AMB
    Mosaic Properties, LLC. A pledge of the equity in AMB Mosaic
    Properties, LLC secures a credit facility providing for loans in
    an initial principal amount outstanding of up to
    $65.0 million, which Fund III obtained during the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2007 And 2006

(Report not required)

1.

ORGANIZATION

On September 17, 2003, AMB Property, L.P. formed AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, LLC (“Alliance
    Fund III, LLC”), a Delaware limited liability company.
    On October 25, 2004, AMB converted Alliance Fund III,
    LLC into a limited partnership, AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. (“Fund III”), a Delaware
    limited partnership, and admitted AMB Institutional Alliance
    REIT III, Inc. (“REIT III”) into Fund III as a
    limited partner. Due to the related party nature of the
    conversion, and that Fund III was under common control with
    Alliance Fund III, LLC, the assets and liabilities were
    accounted for by Fund III at historical cost.

On October 26, 2004 (“Inception”), Fund III
    completed its first closing and accepted capital contributions
    from AMB Property, L.P. and REIT III. On November 1, 2006,
    AMB Property II, L.P. (collectively with AMB Property, L.P.,
    “AMB”) was admitted to Fund III as a limited
    partner in exchange for a contribution of 16 industrial
    buildings with an estimated value of $111.9 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, Fund III has accepted capital
    contributions from AMB and REIT III, and contributions resulting
    from Fund III’s dividend reinvestment program, for
    ownership interests in Fund III of 15.2 percent and
    84.8 percent, respectively. AMB is a general and limited
    partner of Fund III.

As of December 31, 2007, Fund III owned 80 operating
    properties consisting of 169 industrial buildings aggregating
    21.4 million square feet (unaudited) (the
    “Properties”). The Properties are located in the
    following markets: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore/Washington DC,
    Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, Northern New
    Jersey/New York, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, South
    Florida, and Southern California.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of Fund III and the joint
    ventures in which Fund III has a controlling interest.
    Third party equity interests in Fund III’s joint
    ventures are reflected as minority interests in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of Fund III’s long-lived assets could occur in
    the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent
    that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount
    of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to
    income and is included on the consolidated statements of
    operations. The management of Fund III believes that there
    were no impairments of the carrying values of its investments in
    real estate as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in property including
    legal fees and acquisition costs. Project costs associated with
    the development and construction of a real estate project, which
    include interest and property taxes, are capitalized as
    construction in progress. For the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006, Fund III capitalized interest and property
    taxes of approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million,
    respectively.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

Fund III records at acquisition an intangible asset or
    liability for the value attributable to above- or below-market
    leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2007, Fund III has recorded intangible
    assets or liabilities in the amounts of $7.4 million,
    $38.1 million, $28.8 million, and $34.0 million
    for the value attributable to above-market leases, below-market
    leases, in-place leases, and lease origination costs,
    respectively, which are included in buildings and improvements
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of
    December 31, 2006, Fund III had recorded intangible
    assets or liabilities in the amounts of $28.0 million,
    $19.3 million, and $20.2 million for the value
    attributable to above- or below-market leases, in-place leases,
    and lease origination costs, respectively, which are included in
    buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets.

Fund III also records at acquisition an asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market assumed
    mortgage loans payable. As of both December 31, 2007 and
    2006, Fund III has recorded $3.8 million for net
    above- and below-market assumed mortgage loans payable.

Discontinued Operations.

Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets,

requires Fund III to separately report as
    discontinued operations the historical operating results
    attributable to properties held for divestiture or operating
    properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the
    disposition of the properties. Although the application of SFAS
    No. 144 may affect the presentation of Fund III’s
    consolidated results of operations for the periods that it has
    already reported, there will be no effect on its previously
    reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash
    flows.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with reserves from loan proceeds
    for certain capital improvements and real estate tax payments.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related mortgage loans payable. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, deferred financing costs were
    $6.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively, net of
    accumulated amortization.

Mortgage Premiums.

Mortgage premiums represent
    the excess of the fair value of debt over the principal value of
    debt assumed in connection with acquisitions. The mortgage
    premiums are being amortized into interest expense over the term
    of the related debt instrument using the effective- interest
    method. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the unamortized
    mortgage premiums were approximately $1.5 million and
    $2.0 million, respectively.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent interests held by an affiliate of AMB and third-party
    investors in various Fund III entities. Such investments
    are consolidated because Fund III owns a majority interest
    and exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    Fund III are allocated to each of the partners in
    accordance with the partnership agreement. Partner distributions
    are made quarterly. Distributions, other than priority
    distributions (Note 8), are paid or accrued to each of the
    partners in accordance with their respective partnership units
    owned at the time distributions are declared.

On January 1, 2005, Fund III issued 125 Series A
    preferred units at a price of $1,000 per unit, which are held by
    REIT III. REIT III in turn issued 125 shares of
    Series A preferred stock at a price of $1,000 per share.
    The Series A preferred stock is 12.5 percent
    cumulative non-voting preferred stock, callable with a premium
    based on the period of time the stock has been outstanding. The
    call premium was 15.0 percent through December 31,
    2007. The premium will reduce each year thereafter by
    5.0 percent per year such that there will be no premium
    after December 31, 2009. Dividends are payable on June 30
    and December 31 of each year.

Rental Revenues.

Fund III, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. In addition, Fund III nets its bad debt
    expense against rental income for financial reporting purposes.
    Such amounts totaled approximately $1.0 million and $27,000
    for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Fund III recorded net $2.3 million of
    income and net $0.6 million of expense to rental revenues
    related to amortization of lease intangibles

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Of the net $2.3 million recorded for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, $2.0 million relates to
    amortization expense of above-market leases, and
    $4.3 million relates to amortization income of below-market
    leases, respectively. Of the net $0.6 million of expense
    recorded for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    $1.9 million relates to amortization expense of
    above-market leases, and $1.3 million relates to
    amortization income of below-market leases, respectively. The
    lease intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line basis
    over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with Fund III in
    its trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to
    occupy space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on Fund III’s ability to lease space
    and on the level of rent that can be achieved. As of
    December 31, 2007, Fund III did not have any material
    concentration of credit risk due to the diversification of its
    tenants.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

As of
    December 31, 2007, Fund III’s consolidated
    financial instruments include mortgage loans payable and an
    unsecured note payable. Based on borrowing rates available to
    Fund III at December 31, 2007, the estimated fair
    market value of the mortgage loans payable and unsecured note
    payable was $974.6 million. Management of Fund III
    believes that those mortgage loans payable with short maturities
    or variable interest rates approximate fair value.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In July 2006,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), which
    clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
    positions, as defined. FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity
    in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition
    and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. Adoption
    of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not have a material effect
    on Fund III.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. Fund III does not believe that
    the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on
    its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

, which permits entities to choose to measure
    many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
    that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. This Statement is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal year beginning after
    November 15, 2007. Fund III does not believe that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact
    on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

    ESTATE ACQUISITION/DISPOSITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Fund III
    acquired 49 industrial buildings totaling 7,425,913 square
    feet (unaudited). The total aggregate investment was
    approximately $633.7 million, which includes approximately
    $8.9 million in closing costs and acquisition fees related
    to these acquisitions. The $606.7 million total purchase
    price related to these acquisitions was allocated
    $244.3 million to land, $358.0 million to buildings
    and improvements, $8.7 million to in-place leases,
    $13.7 million to lease origination costs, $0.1 million
    to above-market lease assets, and $18.1 million to
    below-market lease liabilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, Fund III
    acquired 74 industrial buildings totaling 7,152,839 square
    feet (unaudited). The total aggregate investment was
    approximately $590.6 million, which includes approximately
    $8.2 million in closing costs and acquisition fees related
    to these acquisitions. The $564.1 million total purchase
    price related to these acquisitions was allocated
    $203.0 million to land, $361.3 million to buildings

    lease liabilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, Fund III
    disposed of 11 industrial buildings totaling 582,877 square
    feet (unaudited), for an aggregate sales price of approximately
    $50.2 million. The disposition resulted in a net gain of
    approximately $20.4 million.

DEBT

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Fund III
    increased the capacity of its existing unsecured revolving
    credit facility providing for loans in an initial principal
    amount outstanding from $60.0 million up to
    $110.0 million. Fund III guarantees the obligations
    under the credit facility pursuant to the revolving credit
    agreement. Fund III intends to use the facility to finance
    its real estate acquisition activity. The credit facility
    matures in December 2011 and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR
    plus 160 basis points (6.20 percent at
    December 31, 2007). In addition, there is an annual
    administration fee of $20,000 per year, payable quarterly in
    arrears. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance
    on this credit facility was $70.0 million. The credit
    facility contains customary and other affirmative covenants and
    negative covenants, including financial reporting requirements
    and maintenance of specific ratios. The management of
    Fund III believes that it was in compliance with these
    financial covenants at December 31, 2007.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Fund III
    obtained an unsecured note payable in the amount of
    $16.0 million. This note payable bears interest at a fixed
    rate of 6.2 percent and matures in October 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Fund III
    obtained eight mortgage loans payable totaling
    $354.3 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.93 percent and mature between 2015 and
    2017.

As of December 31, 2007, Fund III had 29 mortgage
    loans payable totaling $960.5 million, not including
    unamortized mortgage premiums of approximately
    $1.5 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.80 percent and mature between 2009 and
    2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, Fund III
    refinanced two mortgage loans payable totaling
    $113.0 million with maturity dates ranging from 2014 to
    2016, which replaced the then-existing $64.1 million
    outstanding mortgage loans payable that were to mature in 2007
    and 2010.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, Fund III
    repaid $18.5 million of an outstanding mortgage loan
    payable in conjunction with a disposition of real estate. The
    loan bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.05 percent.

As of December 31, 2006, Fund III had 21 mortgage
    loans payable totaling $613.5 million, not including
    unamortized mortgage premiums of approximately
    $2.0 million. These loans bore interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.73 percent and mature between 2009 and
    2016.

The mortgage loans payable are collateralized by certain of the
    Properties and require monthly interest and principal payments
    until maturity. Certain of the mortgage loans payable are
    cross-collateralized. In addition, the mortgage loans payable
    have various covenants. Management of Fund III believes
    that Fund III was in compliance with these covenants at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Fund III also
    borrowed and repaid $33.1 million in the form of a
    collateralized note payable to AMB. The note bore interest at a
    rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points (6.60 percent at
    December 31, 2007), which totaled approximately $44,000 for
    the year ended December 31, 2007.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, Fund III also
    borrowed and repaid $65.0 million in the form of
    collateralized notes payable to AMB. The notes bore interest at
    LIBOR plus 200 basis points (7.12 percent at
    December 31, 2006), which totaled approximately
    $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, AMB receives
    acquisition fees equal to 0.9 percent of the acquisition
    cost of properties acquired. For the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, Fund III paid AMB
    acquisition fees of approximately $4.3 million and
    $4.4 million, respectively. Acquisition fees are
    capitalized and included in investments in real estate in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

At certain properties, AMB is responsible for the property
    management or the accounting or both. On a monthly basis, AMB
    earns property management fees between 1.05 percent and
    2.6 percent of the respective property’s cash
    receipts. On a monthly basis, AMB earns accounting fees between
    0.22 percent and 1.0 percent of the respective
    property’s cash receipts. For the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, AMB earned property management
    and accounting fees of approximately $1.7 million and
    $1.0 million, respectively.

At certain properties, AMB earns a leasing commission when it
    has acted as the listing broker or the procuring broker or both.
    For both the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, AMB
    earned leasing commissions of approximately $0.1 million.

On a quarterly basis, AMB, as general partner, receives priority
    distributions of 7.5 percent of net operating income
    (excluding straight-line rents, straight-line ground rent
    expense, and amortization of lease intangibles) for providing
    asset management services to Fund III. AMB earned approximately
    $7.3 million and $4.9 million in priority
    distributions for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    Fund III owed AMB $0.2 million and $0.6 million,
    respectively, in operating cash flow distributions, priority
    distributions, and other miscellaneous items, which is included
    in accounts payable and other liabilities and distributions
    payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

AMB
    INSTITUTIONAL ALLIANCE FUND III, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For renovation properties, AMB earns a quarterly fee equal to
    0.70 percent per annum of the respective property’s
    acquisition cost (as defined). Such renovation fees are payable
    in arrears over the property’s initial renovation period
    (as defined). For the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, AMB earned renovation fees of $0 and $0.1 million,
    respectively. Such renovation fees are capitalized and are
    included in investments in real estate in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets.

Commencing June 30, 2008 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2007, no incentive distribution has been earned by AMB.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Unknown liabilities may include liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, accrued but
    unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to $2.2 million and $1.0 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, Fund III may be involved in legal
    actions relating to the ownership and operations of its
    Properties. Management does not expect that the liabilities, if
    any, that may ultimately result from such legal actions would
    have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows of Fund III.

Environmental Matters.

Fund III follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. Fund III is not aware of
    any environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on Fund III’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on Fund III’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

Fund III
    carries property and rental loss, liability, flood,
    environmental and terrorism insurance. Fund III believes
    that the policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are
    adequate and appropriate under the circumstances, given the
    relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry
    practice. In addition, certain of Fund III’s
    properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
    activity; therefore, Fund III has obtained limited
    earthquake insurance on those properties. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts
    of war that may be either uninsurable or not economically
    insurable. Although Fund III has obtained coverage for
    certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and
    insured limits that Fund III believes are commercially
    reasonable, it is not certain that Fund III will be able to
    collect under such policies. Should an uninsured loss occur,
    Fund III could lose its investment in, and anticipated
    profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has adopted certain
    policies with respect to insurance coverage and proceeds as part
    of its operating policies, which apply to properties owned or
    managed by AMB, including properties owned by Fund III.

ORGANIZATION

On May 19, 2005, AMB Japan Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Japan”) and AMB Property II, L.P. as limited partner,
    formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the “Fund”), a
    Cayman Islands-exempted limited partnership. On June 30,
    2005 (“Inception”), 13 institutional investors were
    admitted as limited partners to the Fund and AMB Property II,
    L.P. withdrew as a limited partner.

The limited partners have collectively committed
    ¥49.5 billion in equity to the Fund and AMB Japan, as
    general partner, has committed ¥0.5 billion in equity
    to the Fund. In addition, AMB Property Singapore Pte. Ltd.
    (“AMB Singapore”) has committed
    ¥11.9 billion in equity to co-invest with the Fund in
    properties. As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had completed
    seven capital calls totaling ¥31.7 billion and
    ¥0.3 billion from the limited partners and general
    partner, respectively, of which non-cash contributions from the
    general partner totaled ¥0.2 billion.

The Fund and AMB Singapore co-invest (80.81 percent and
    19.19 percent, respectively) in Singapore private limited
    companies (“PTEs”) which indirectly own industrial
    real estate in Japan. The properties are owned individually in
    Japanese Tokutei Mokuteki Kaishas (“TMKs”). TMKs are
    asset-backed entities subject to tax on income net of
    distributions. Distributions from TMKs to non-residents are
    subject to local withholding taxes.

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund indirectly owned
    80.81 percent of 26 operating buildings (the
    “Properties”) aggregating approximately
    6.3 million square feet (unaudited). The Properties are
    located in the Fukuoka market, the Chiba, Funabashi, Kashiwa,
    Kawasaki, Narita, Narashino, Ohta, Sagamihara and Saitama
    submarkets of Tokyo, and the Amagasaki submarket of Osaka.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“U.S. GAAP”) in Yen currency. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the
    Fund and the ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s
    ventures are reflected as minority interests in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Functional and Reporting Currency.

The Yen is
    both the functional and reporting currency for the Fund’s
    operations. Functional currency is the currency of the primary
    economic environment in which the Fund operates. Monetary assets
    and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Yen are
    remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economic and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of the Fund’s long-lived assets could occur in the
    future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent
    that a

S-41


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the
    property over its estimated fair value is charged to income and
    is included in the consolidated statements of operations. The
    management of the Fund believes that there were no impairments
    of the carrying values of its investments in real estate as of
    December 31, 2008.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    investments in real estate. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in the property
    including legal fees and acquisition costs.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

The Fund records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Fund has recorded
    ¥553.4 million, ¥1.5 billion, and
    ¥235.0 million for the value attributable to
    below-market leases, in-place leases, and lease origination
    costs, respectively, which are included in buildings and
    improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    reserves required to be held pursuant to agreements with Chuo
    Mitsui Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., JP Morgan
    Trust Bank, Ltd. (“JP Morgan”), Sumitomo Mitsui
    Banking Corporation, Shinsei Bank, Limited, and Mitsubishi UFJ
    Lease and Finance Company Limited, as well as cash held in
    escrow under the terms of the loan agreement with JP Morgan.
    Pursuant to these agreements, minimum levels of cash are
    required to be held as reserves for operating expenses, real
    estate taxes and insurance reserves, security deposits,
    maintenance reserves and periodic withholding of collections for
    debt servicing. During the year ended December 31, 2008,
    ¥2.2 billion of restricted cash, which was held
    directly by the Fund as collateral, was released upon full
    repayment of the ¥2.2 billion secured loan payable in
    connection with the Fund’s acquisition of AMB Funabashi
    Distribution Center 6 in 2007.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related debt. As of December 31, 2008,
    deferred financing costs were ¥798.9 million, net of
    accumulated amortization.

Financial Instruments.

Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging
    Activities

, provides comprehensive guidelines for the
    recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging
    activities and, specifically, requires all derivatives to be
    recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income or loss. The Fund’s derivative financial instruments
    in effect at December 31, 2008 were eight interest rate
    swaps, hedging cash flows of the Fund’s variable rate bonds
    based on Tokyo Inter-bank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”) and
    London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a
    margin. Adjustments to the fair value of these instruments for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted in a loss of
    ¥469.0 million, net of minority interests. The fair
    value of the interest rate

S-42


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

swaps are included in accounts payable and other liabilities in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the loss is
    included in other comprehensive loss in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of partners’ capital.

Mortgage and Bond Premiums.

Mortgage and bond
    premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt over the
    principal value of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions.
    The mortgage and bond premiums are being amortized into interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2008, the
    unamortized mortgage and bond premiums were approximately
    ¥30.4 million.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent a 19.19 percent indirect equity interest in the
    Properties held by AMB Singapore. Such investments are
    consolidated because the Fund owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Fund are allocated to each of the partners in accordance
    with the Fund’s partnership agreement. Partner
    distributions are expected to be made on a semi- annual basis
    when distributable proceeds are available. Distributions, other
    than priority distributions (Note 8), are made to each of
    the partners in accordance with their respective ownership
    interests at the time of the distribution.

Rental Revenues.

The Fund, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. In addition, the Fund nets its bad debt expense
    against rental income for financial reporting purposes. During
    the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund recorded bad
    debt expense of ¥93.5 million. The
    ¥93.5 million comprises ¥22.1 million for
    base rent and utilities, ¥20.0 million for punitive
    rent, and ¥51.4 million for termination compensation.
    The Fund recorded ¥163.0 million of revenue related to
    the amortization of lease intangibles for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The lease intangibles are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Fund in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Fund’s ability to lease space and on
    the level of rent that can be achieved. The Fund had five
    tenants that accounted for 42.6 percent of rental revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Fund’s financial instruments include mortgage loans
    payable, bonds payable and a secured loan payable. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Fund at December 31, 2008,
    the estimated fair value of the financial instruments was
    ¥78.4 billion.

New Accounting Pronouncement’s.

In
    December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business
    Combinations

, which changes the accounting for business
    combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued
    in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of
    contingent consideration, the accounting for preacquisition gain
    and loss contingencies, the accounting for acquisition-related
    restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of
    acquisition-related transaction costs and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Fund is
    in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows, but, at a minimum, it will
    require the expensing of transaction costs.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51

,
    which clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary
    is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should
    be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.
    This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Fund is
    in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 will have on its financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

S-43


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,

which requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures
    about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under Statement No. 133 and
    its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
    SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
    The Fund is in the process of evaluating the impact of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 161.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances
    disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the exchange price
    that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
    market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants on the measurement date.
    SFAS No. 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
    which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
    measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of
    inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated
    balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the
    valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
    liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative
    contracts that are traded in an active exchange market.

Level 2.

Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities
    include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less
    frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative
    contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with
    inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This
    category generally includes certain corporate debt securities
    and derivative contracts.

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation. This
    category generally includes long-term derivative contracts and
    real estate.

The Fund adopted SFAS No. 157 with respect to its

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund acquired
    an 80.81 percent equity interest in two entities that
    indirectly owned two operating properties aggregating
    891,596 square feet (unaudited) from AMB Japan. AMB
    Singapore retained 19.19 percent of the equity interest in
    the same entities. The total aggregate investment cost was
    approximately ¥18.7 billion which includes
    approximately ¥23.3 million in closing costs related
    to these acquisitions. As of December 31, 2008, the Fund
    owed AMB Japan ¥163.0 million, which represents the
    unpaid portion of the purchase price related to these
    acquisitions, and is included in net payables to affiliates in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The total purchase price, excluding closing costs and
    acquisition fees, has been allocated as follows:

DEBT

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had four mortgage loans
    payable totaling ¥16.7 billion. Of the
    ¥16.7 billion mortgage loans payable,
    ¥14.0 billion bears interest at a rate per annum equal
    to TIBOR plus a margin ranging from 130 to 150 basis
    points. ¥10.4 billion matures in September 2010 and
    ¥3.6 billion matures in August 2011. To hedge the cash
    flows of these floating rate borrowings, the Fund purchased
    interest swaps, which have fixed the interest rates payable on
    principal amounts totaling ¥14.0 billion as of
    December 31, 2008 at rates ranging from 1.05 percent
    to 1.07 percent per annum, excluding margins. Including the
    interest rate swaps, the effective borrowings cost for the
    ¥14.0 billion mortgage loans payable as of
    December 31, 2008 is 2.41 percent. The loans payable
    are collateralized by a first priority security interest in, and
    to all of certain TMKs’ right, title and interest in and to
    11 buildings, and severally but not jointly guaranteed by the
    Fund and AMB Singapore, the indirect owners of the TMKs.

Of the remainder of the ¥16.7 billion,
    ¥2.7 billion as of December 31, 2008, not
    including unamortized mortgage premiums of approximately
    ¥13.5 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of
    2.83 percent and matures in 2011. The mortgage loan payable
    is collateralized by certain of the Properties and requires
    interest only payments to be made quarterly until maturity in
    2011. In addition, the mortgage loan payable has various
    covenants. Management of the Fund believes that the Fund was in
    compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had one collateralized
    bond payable, totaling ¥3.3 billion, not including an
    unamortized bond premium of ¥16.9 million. The bond
    bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures
    in 2011. Principal amortization on the bond started in June 2007.

If at any such time the principal outstanding on the
    ¥3.3 billion bond payable reaches the balance of the
    principal outstanding on the ¥2.7 billion mortgage
    loan payable, amortization of principal would then be applied on
    a pro rata basis of 50.0 percent to the bond payable and
    50.0 percent to the mortgage loan payable.

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had six collateralized
    specified bonds payable totaling ¥50.3 billion. Of the
    ¥50.3 billion bonds payable, ¥41.0 billion
    bear interest at rates per annum equal to the rates of
    three-month TIBOR and Yen LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to
    155 basis points and matures between 2012 and 2013. To
    hedge the cash flows of these floating rate borrowings, the Fund
    purchased interest swaps, which have fixed the interest rates
    payable on principal amounts totaling ¥36.4 billion as
    of December 31, 2008 at rates ranging from
    1.32 percent

to 1.60 percent per annum excluding the margin. Including
    the interest rate swaps, the effective borrowing cost for the
    ¥41.0 billion bonds payable as of December 31,
    2008 is 2.56 percent per annum. Of the remainder of the
    ¥50.3 billion bonds payable, ¥6.9 billion
    and ¥2.4 billion bear interest at fixed rates of
    2.54 percent and 4.30 percent, respectively, and
    mature in 2013.

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had a secured loan
    payable totaling ¥12.0 billion. The outstanding loan
    payable bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a
    margin of 100 basis points and matures in
    January 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
    the interest rate approximated 1.79 percent per annum. The
    loan payable is collateralized by the partners’ capital
    commitments.

The scheduled principal payments of the Fund’s mortgage
    loans payable, bonds payable and secured loans payable as of
    December 31, 2008 are as follows:

Except for the secured loan payable of ¥12.0 billion
    due in January 2009 which is held by the Fund, the Fund’s
    operating properties, mortgage loans payable and bonds payable
    are all held in Japanese TMKs, which are special purpose
    companies (“SPCs”). TMKs are SPCs established under
    Japanese Asset Liquidation law. As of December 31, 2008,
    the 11 TMKs included in the Fund’s consolidated financial
    statements are AMB Funabashi Tokorozawa TMK, AMB Higashi-Ogijima
    TMK, AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Narita 1-1 TMK, AMB Amagasaki TMK, AMB
    Kashiwa TMK, AMB Funabashi 6 TMK, AMB Minami Kanto TMK, AMB
    Funabashi 5 TMK, AMB Sagamihara TMK and AMB Narita 1-2 TMK. The
    Properties owned by AMB Funabashi Tokorozawa TMK collateralize
    one mortgage loan payable and one bond payable. The properties
    owned by AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Narita 1-1 TMK, AMB Amagasaki TMK,
    AMB Kashiwa TMK, AMB Funabashi 5 TMK and AMB Sagamihara TMK
    collateralize bonds payable by the respective entities. Five
    properties owned by AMB Funabashi 6 TMK, five properties owned
    by AMB Minami Kanto TMK and the property owned by AMB Narita 1-2
    TMK collateralize mortgage loans payable. The creditors of the
    TMKs do not have recourse to any other assets or revenues of AMB
    Japan or its affiliated entities. Conversely, the creditors of
    AMB Japan and its affiliated entities do not have recourse to
    any of the assets or revenues of the TMKs.

INCOME
    AND WITHHOLDING TAXES

The Fund is exempt from all forms of taxation in the Cayman
    Islands, including income, capital gains, and withholding tax.
    The foreign countries where the Fund has operations may impose
    income, withholding, and other direct and indirect taxes under
    their respective laws. Generally, the foreign countries impose a
    withholding tax rate on dividends or interest between countries
    based on various treaty rates. The Japanese Yugen Kaisha
    (“YK”) entities are also subject to a 42% statutory
    rate. Accordingly, the Fund recognizes income taxes for these
    jurisdictions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as necessary.
    As of December 31, 2008, the Fund has accrued a current tax
    liability of ¥264.4 million, representing future
    withholding taxes on distributions from operations and other
    local income taxes in Japan and Singapore. The Fund also accrued
    a deferred tax asset of ¥49.6 million as of
    December 31, 2008. This amount is included in accounts
    receivables and other assets in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet.

The tax consequences for each partner of the Fund of acquiring,
    holding, or disposing of partnership interests will depend upon
    the relevant laws of any jurisdiction to which the partner is
    subject.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had an obligation of
    ¥163.0 million payable to AMB Japan, related to the
    unpaid portion of the contribution value for the Singapore PTE
    entities contributed to the Fund by AMB Japan, which is included
    in net payables to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
    Agreement, as amended, (the “Partnership Agreement”)
    and the Co-Investment Agreement, AMB Japan receives an
    acquisition fee equal to 0.9 percent of the Fund’s
    share of the acquisition cost of properties purchased from third
    parties. This acquisition fee is reduced by a 0.4 percent
    acquisition fee AMB Singapore receives of the acquisition cost
    of properties purchased from third parties who are referred to
    the Fund by AMB Singapore. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Fund incurred no acquisition fees.

Pursuant to the Asset Management Fees Agreement, on
    January 1, 2006, AMB Property Japan began providing asset
    management services to the Properties. The asset management fee
    is payable monthly. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
    the Fund recorded asset management fees of approximately
    ¥187.1 million, which is included in general and
    administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations.

Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, AMB Singapore
    receives management service fees, payable on a quarterly basis,
    equal to 0.25 percent of capital (equity and shareholder
    loans) contributed to each PTE by the Fund and AMB Singapore.
    For the year ended December 31, 2008, the PTEs recorded
    management service fees of approximately
    ¥61.1 million, which is included in general and
    administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations. As of December 31, 2008, the Fund
    owed ¥50.1 million for management service fees, which
    is included in distributions payable in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement from June 30, 2005 to
    June 30, 2006, AMB Japan, as general partner, received
    asset management priority distributions equal to
    1.5 percent per annum, payable on a quarterly basis, of
    aggregate capital commitments made to the Fund from the
    effective date of the agreement through the Supplemental Capital
    Call Date (as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement).
    Pursuant to the Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated
    Limited Partnership Agreement of the Limited Partnership, for
    the period from July 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007,
    the asset management priority distribution base changed from
    100.0 percent to

S-48


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

90.0 percent of the aggregate capital commitments to the
    Fund; for the period from April 1, 2007 through
    March 31, 2008, the asset management priority distribution
    base changed from 90.0 percent to 80.0 percent of the
    aggregate capital commitments to the Fund; for the period from
    April 1, 2008 through the Supplementary Capital Call Date,
    the asset management priority distribution base changed from
    80.0 percent to 65.0 percent of the aggregate capital
    commitments to the Fund until the earlier of 65.0 percent
    of capital commitments being called or the Supplemental Capital
    Call Date. Subsequently, AMB Japan receives asset management
    priority distribution equal to 1.5 percent per annum,
    payable on a quarterly basis, of the unreturned capital
    contributions. The amounts referred to above are reduced by
    amounts paid or accrued to AMB Singapore for management service
    fees pursuant to the Management Services Agreement and asset
    management fees paid or accrued to AMB Property Japan, pursuant
    to the Agreement Regarding Asset Management Fees.

Promptly following the Supplemental Capital Call Date, an asset
    management priority distribution recalculation will be performed
    as follows:

(i) For the period from July 1, 2006 through
    March 31, 2007 (the “First Calculation Period”),
    the asset management priority distribution will be recalculated
    based on the greater of 90.0 percent of the aggregate
    capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent of the
    unreturned capital contributions. If the recalculated asset
    management priority distribution is greater than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the First
    Calculation Period, a special distribution equal to the
    difference shall be paid by the Fund to AMB Japan at the time of
    such recalculation. If the recalculated asset management
    priority distribution is equal to or less than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the First
    Calculation Period, no additional amount shall be paid by the
    Fund to AMB Japan and no refund of such difference shall be paid
    by AMB Japan to the Fund.

(ii) For the period from April 1, 2007 through
    March 31, 2008 (the “Second Calculation Period”),
    the asset management priority distribution will be recalculated
    based on the greater of 80.0 percent of the aggregate
    capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent of the
    unreturned capital contributions. If the recalculated asset
    management priority distribution is greater than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Second
    Calculation Period, a special distribution equal to the
    difference shall be paid by the Fund to AMB Japan at the time of
    such recalculation. If the recalculated asset management
    priority distribution is equal to or less than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Second
    Calculation Period, no additional amount shall be paid by the
    Fund to AMB Japan and no refund of such difference shall be paid
    by AMB Japan to the Fund.

(iii) For the period from April 1, 2008 through the
    Supplemental Capital Call Date (the “Third Calculation
    Period”), the asset management priority distribution will
    be recalculated based on the greater of 65.0 percent of the
    aggregate capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent
    of the unreturned capital contributions. If the recalculated
    asset management priority distribution is greater than the
    amount previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Third
    Calculation Period, a special distribution equal to the
    difference shall be paid by the Fund to AMB Japan at the time of
    such recalculation. If the recalculated asset management
    priority distribution is equal to or less than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Third
    Calculation Period, no additional amount shall be paid by the
    Fund to AMB Japan and no refund of such difference shall be paid
    by AMB Japan to the Fund.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund recorded
    asset management priority distributions of approximately
    ¥314.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Fund
    owed ¥1.2 billion for asset management priority
    distributions, which is included in distributions payable in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, AMB Japan receives
    incentive distributions equal to 20.0 percent of the amount
    over a 10.0 percent net nominal internal rate of return
    (“IRR”) accruing to the limited partners. The
    incentive distributions increase to 25.0 percent of the
    amount over a 13.0 percent IRR accruing to the limited
    partners. As of December 31, 2008, no incentive
    distribution has been paid or accrued.

AMB, the indirect owner of AMB Japan, obtains company-wide
    insurance coverage from third parties that apply to all
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including the Properties. As
    such, the Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance
    expense incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Fund recorded insurance expense of
    approximately ¥222.4 million.

At certain properties, AMB Property Japan earns a leasing
    commission when it has acted as the listing broker or the
    procuring broker or both. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, AMB Property Japan earned leasing
    commissions of ¥35.5 million.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset Management Agreements
    with certain TMKs, AMB Property Japan earns an accounting fee

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. Management of the Fund believes that the
    policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate
    and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk
    of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Fund’s properties are located in
    areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Fund has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although the Fund has
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that management of the Fund
    believes are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the
    Fund will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Fund.

(Report not required)

1.

ORGANIZATION

On May 19, 2005, AMB Japan Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Japan”) and AMB Property II, L.P. as limited partner,
    formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the “Fund”), a
    Cayman Islands-exempted limited partnership. On June 30,
    2005 (“Inception”), 13 institutional investors were
    admitted as limited partners to the Fund and AMB Property II,
    L.P. withdrew as a limited partner.

The limited partners have collectively committed
    ¥49.5 billion in equity to the Fund and AMB Japan, as
    general partner, has committed ¥0.5 billion in equity
    to the Fund. In addition, AMB Property Singapore Pte. Ltd.
    (“AMB Singapore”) has committed
    ¥11.9 billion in equity to co-invest with the Fund in
    properties. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had completed
    five capital calls totaling ¥26.8 billion and
    ¥0.3 billion from the limited partners and general
    partner, respectively, of which non-cash contributions from the
    general partner totaled ¥0.2 billion.

The Fund and AMB Singapore co-invest (80.81 percent and
    19.19 percent, respectively) in Singapore private limited
    companies (“PTEs”) which indirectly own industrial
    real estate in Japan. The properties are owned individually in
    Japanese Tokutei Mokuteki Kaishas (“TMKs”). TMKs are
    asset-backed entities subject to tax on income net of
    distributions. Distributions from TMKs to non-residents are
    subject to local withholding taxes.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund indirectly owned
    80.81 percent of 24 operating buildings (the
    “Properties”) aggregating approximately
    5.4 million square feet. The Properties are located in the
    Fukuoka market and in the following submarkets of Tokyo: Chiba,
    Funabashi, Kashiwa, Kawasaki, Narita, Narashino, Ohta, and
    Saitama, and the Amagasaki submarket of Osaka.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“U.S. GAAP”) in Yen currency. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the
    Fund and the joint ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s joint
    ventures are reflected as minority interests in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Functional and Reporting Currency.

The Yen is
    both the functional and reporting currency for the Fund’s
    operations. Functional currency is the currency of the primary
    economic environment in which the Fund operates. Monetary assets
    and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Yen are
    remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economic and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of

S-57


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Fund’s long-lived assets could occur in the future
    period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a
    property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the
    property over its estimated fair value is charged to income and
    is included in the consolidated statements of operations. The
    management of the Fund believes that there were no impairments
    of the carrying values of its investments in real estate as of
    December 31, 2007.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    investments in real estate. The estimated lives are as follows:

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Estimated Lives

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in the property
    including legal fees and acquisition costs.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

The Fund records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Fund has recorded intangible assets
    and liabilities in the amounts of ¥553.4 million,
    ¥1.2 billion, and ¥137.1 million for the
    value attributable to below-market leases, in-place leases, and
    lease origination costs, respectively, which are included in
    buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    reserves required to be held pursuant to agreements with Chuo
    Mitsui Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., JP Morgan
    Trust Bank, Ltd. (“JP Morgan”), Sumitomo Mitsui
    Banking Corporation and Shinsei Bank, Limited, as well as cash
    held in escrow under the terms of the loan agreement with JP
    Morgan. Pursuant to these agreements, minimum levels of cash are
    required to be held as reserves for operating expenses, real
    estate taxes and insurance reserves, security deposits,
    consumption tax and maintenance reserves. Restricted cash also
    includes cash held directly by the Fund as collateral for a
    ¥2.2 billion of secured loan payable in connection
    with the Fund’s acquisition of AMB Funabashi Distribution
    Center 6. Upon repayment of the secured loan payable, the cash
    will be released. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
    ¥2.6 billion of restricted cash, which was held
    directly by the Fund as collateral, was released upon full
    repayment of the ¥2.6 billion secured loan payable in
    connection with the Fund’s acquisition of Higashi-Ogijima
    Distribution Center in 2005.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related debt. As of December 31, 2007,
    deferred financing costs were ¥458.8 million, net of
    accumulated amortization.

Financial Instruments.

Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging Activities, provides
    comprehensive guidelines for the recognition and measurement of
    derivatives and hedging activities and, specifically, requires
    all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
    value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated
    other comprehensive income or loss. The Fund’s derivative
    financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2007 were
    five interest rate swaps, hedging cash flows of the Fund’s
    variable rate bonds based on Tokyo Inter-bank Offered Rate
    (“TIBOR”) and London Inter-

S-58


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin. Adjustments
    to the fair value of these instruments for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 resulted in a loss of
    ¥406.1 million, net of minority interests. There were
    no other derivative financial instruments included in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. This loss is included in accounts
    payable and other liabilities and other comprehensive loss in
    the accompanying consolidated statement of partners’
    capital.

Mortgage and Bond Premiums.

Mortgage and bond
    premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt over the
    principal value of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions.
    The mortgage and bond premiums are being amortized into interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2007, the
    unamortized mortgage and bond premiums were approximately
    ¥43.9 million.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent a 19.19 percent indirect equity interest in the
    Properties held by AMB Singapore. Such investments are
    consolidated because the Fund owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Fund are allocated to each of the partners in accordance
    with the Fund’s partnership agreement. Partner
    distributions are expected to be made on a semi-annual basis
    when distributable proceeds are available. Distributions, other
    than priority distributions (Note 8), are made to each of
    the partners in accordance with their respective ownership
    interests at the time of the distribution.

Rental Revenues.

The Fund, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. The Fund recorded ¥95.7 million of
    revenue related to the amortization of lease intangibles for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. The lease intangibles are
    being amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Fund in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Fund’s ability to lease space and on
    the level of rent that can be achieved. The Fund had five
    tenants that accounted for 47.7 percent of rental revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Fund’s financial instruments include a mortgage loan
    payable, bonds payable and secured loans payable. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Fund at December 31, 2007,
    the estimated fair market value of the financial instruments was
    ¥74.4 billion.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In July 2006,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), which
    clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
    positions, as defined. FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity
    in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition
    and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. Adoption
    of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not have a material
    effect on the Fund.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The Fund does not believe that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact
    on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

, which permits entities to choose to measure
    many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
    that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between entities

S-59


AMB JAPAN

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

that choose different measurement attributes for similar types
    of assets and liabilities. This Statement is effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal year beginning after
    November 15, 2007. The Fund does not believe that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact
    on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund acquired
    11 buildings totaling 1,105,800 square feet. The total
    aggregate investment was approximately ¥22.0 billion,
    which includes approximately ¥660.9 million in closing
    costs and acquisition fees related to these acquisitions.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund acquired
    an 80.81 percent equity interest in an entity that
    indirectly owned an operating property aggregating
    469,627 square feet from AMB Japan. AMB Singapore retained
    19.19 percent of the equity interest in the same entity.
    The total aggregate investment cost was approximately
    ¥9.7 billion which includes ¥19.5 million in
    closing costs. As of December 31, 2007, AMB Japan owed the
    Fund ¥29.7 million, which represents the overpaid
    portion of the purchase price, and is included in net payables
    to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The total purchase price, excluding closing costs and
    acquisition fees has been allocated as follows:

DEBT

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had one mortgage loan
    payable totaling ¥2.7 billion, not including an
    unamortized mortgage premium of approximately
    ¥19.5 million. The mortgage loan payable bears
    interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures in
    2011.

The mortgage loan payable is collateralized by certain of the
    Properties and requires interest only payments to be made
    quarterly until maturity in 2011. In addition, the mortgage loan
    payable has various covenants. Management of the Fund believes
    that the Fund was in compliance with these covenants as of
    December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had one collateralized
    bond payable totaling ¥3.3 billion, not including an
    unamortized bond premium of ¥24.4 million. The bond
    bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures
    in 2011. Principal amortization on this bond started in June
    2007.

If at any such time the principal outstanding on the
    ¥3.3 billion bond payable reaches the balance of the
    principal outstanding on the ¥2.7 billion mortgage
    loan payable, amortization of principal would then be applied on
    a pro rata basis of 50.0 percent to the bond payable and
    50.0 percent to the mortgage loan payable.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had five collateralized
    specified bonds payable totaling ¥41.2 billion. The
    bonds bear interest at rates per annum equal to the rates of the
    TIBOR and Yen LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to
    155 basis points and mature between 2012 and 2013. To hedge
    the cash flows of these floating rate borrowings, the Fund
    purchased interest swaps, which have fixed the interest rates
    payable on principal amounts totaling ¥36.6 billion as
    of December 31, 2007, at rates ranging from
    1.32 percent to 1.60 percent per annum excluding the

margin. Including the interest rate swaps, the effective
    borrowing costs for the ¥41.2 billion bonds as of
    December 31, 2007 is 2.54 percent per annum.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had secured loans payable
    totaling ¥27.3 billion:

(i) Of the ¥27.3 billion secured loans payable,
    ¥15.5 billion bears interest at a rate per annum equal
    to TIBOR plus a margin ranging from 20 to 95 basis points.
    ¥13.3 billion matures in June 2008 and
    ¥2.2 billion matures in February 2008. For the year
    ended December 31, 2007, the interest rate approximated
    0.74 percent per annum. ¥2.2 billion of the loans
    payable is secured by the restricted cash balances held directly
    by the Fund in a cash collateral account.
    ¥13.3 billion of the loans payable is secured by a
    first priority security interest in, and to all of certain
    TMKs’ right, title and interest in and to nine buildings,
    and severally but not jointly guaranteed by the Fund and AMB
    Singapore, the indirect owners of the TMKs.

(ii) Of the ¥27.3 billion secured loans payable,
    ¥11.8 billion bears interest at a rate per annum equal
    to LIBOR plus a margin of 75 basis points and matures in
    April 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    interest rate approximated 1.31 percent per annum. The loan
    payable is secured by the partners’ capital commitments.

The scheduled principal payments of the Fund’s mortgage
    payable, bonds payable and secured loans payable as of

Except for the secured loan payable of ¥11.8 billion

    properties, mortgage loan payable, bonds payable, and secured
    loans payable are all held in Japanese TMKs, which are special
    purpose companies (“SPCs”). TMKs are SPCs established
    under Japanese Asset Liquidation law. As of December 31,
    2007, the nine TMKs included in the Fund’s consolidated
    financial statements are AMB Funabashi Tokorozawa TMK, AMB
    Higashi-Ogijima TMK, AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Narita 1-1 TMK, AMB
    Amagasaki TMK, AMB Kashiwa TMK, AMB Funabashi 6 TMK, AMB Minami
    Kanto TMK and AMB Funabashi 5 TMK. The Properties owned by AMB
    Funabashi Tokorozawa TMK collateralize one mortgage loan payable
    and one bond payable. One of the secured loans payable held by
    AMB Funabashi 6 TMK is collateralized by cash directly held by
    the Fund in a cash collateral account. The properties owned by
    AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Narita 1-1 TMK, AMB Amagasaki TMK, AMB
    Kashiwa TMK and AMB Funabashi 5 TMK collateralize bonds payable
    by the respective entities. Four out of the five properties
    owned by AMB Funabashi 6 TMK and five properties owned by AMB
    Minami Kanto TMK collateralize secured loans payable. The
    creditors of the TMKs do not have recourse to any other assets
    or revenues of AMB Japan or its affiliated entities. Conversely,
    the creditors of AMB Japan and its affiliated entities do not
    have recourse to any of the assets or revenues of the TMKs.

INCOME
    AND WITHHOLDING TAXES

The Fund is exempt from all forms of taxation in the Cayman
    Islands, including income, capital gains, and withholding tax.
    The foreign countries where the Fund has operations may impose
    income, withholding, and other direct and indirect taxes under
    their respective laws. Accordingly, the Fund recognizes income
    taxes for these jurisdictions in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
    as necessary. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund has accrued
    a current tax liability of ¥28.3 million, representing
    future withholding taxes on distributions from operations in
    Japan and Singapore. The Fund also accrued a deferred tax asset
    of ¥72.5 million as of December 31, 2007. These
    amounts are included in accounts payable and other liabilities
    and accounts receivables and other assets in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.

The tax consequences for each partner of the Fund of acquiring,
    holding, or disposing of partnership interests will depend upon
    the relevant laws of any jurisdiction to which the partner is
    subject.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

During the year ended December 31, 2007, AMB Japan
    contributed its equity interest in one Singapore PTE entity,
    which owned a 80.81 percent indirect interest in one
    operating property, aggregating 0.5 million square feet, to
    the Fund. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had an
    obligation of ¥86.0 million, payable to AMB Japan,
    related to the unpaid portion of the contribution value for the
    Singapore PTE entities, which is included in net payables to
    affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
    Agreement and the Co-Investment Agreement, AMB Japan receives an
    acquisition fee equal to 0.9 percent of the Fund’s
    share of the acquisition cost of properties purchased from third
    parties. This acquisition fee is reduced by a 0.4 percent
    acquisition fee AMB Singapore receives of the acquisition cost
    of properties purchased from third parties who are referred to
    the Fund by AMB Singapore. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, the Fund incurred acquisition fees of approximately
    ¥157.0 million, of which ¥87.2 million was
    paid to AMB Japan and ¥69.8 million was paid to AMB
    Singapore related to the Fund’s acquisition of AMB
    Funabashi Distribution Center 6-9, AMB Fukuoka Distribution
    Center 1, AMB Chiba Distribution Center 1, AMB Higashi-Ogijima
    Distribution Center 2, AMB Narashino Distribution Center 1 and
    AMB Saitama Distribution Center 4 and 5. As of December 31,
    2007, ¥2.3 million was payable to AMB Japan and
    ¥1.9 million was payable to AMB Singapore related to
    the Fund’s acquisition of AMB Saitama Distribution Center
    4, which are included in net payables to affiliates in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The acquisition fee paid to AMB Blackpine Ltd (a former joint
    venture company which was subsequently fully acquired by
    AMB’s wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary during the year
    ended December 31, 2006) in relation to the
    acquisition of Higashi-Ogijima Distribution Center in 2005 was
    capitalized and included in investments in real estate in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31,
    2007, the unamortized acquisition fee was approximately
    ¥59.7 million.

Pursuant to an asset management fees agreement, on
    January 1, 2006, AMB Property Japan began providing asset
    management services to the Properties. The asset management fee
    is payable monthly. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Fund recorded asset management fees of approximately
    ¥146.1 million.

Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, AMB Singapore
    receives management service fees, payable on a quarterly basis,
    equal to 0.25 percent of capital (equity and shareholder
    loans) contributed to each PTE by the

Fund and AMB Singapore. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, the PTEs recorded management service fees of approximately
    ¥49.3 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund
    owed ¥44.5 million, for management service fees, which
    are included in net payables to affiliates in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated
    Limited Partnership Agreement of Limited Partnership, for the
    period from July 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007, the
    asset management priority distribution base changed from
    100.0 percent to 90.0 percent of the aggregate capital
    commitments to the Fund; and for the period from April 1,
    2007 through the Supplemental Capital Call Date, the asset
    management priority distribution base changed from
    90.0 percent to 80.0 percent of the aggregate capital
    commitments to the Fund until the earlier of 80.0 percent
    of capital commitments being called or the Supplemental Capital
    Call Date. Subsequently, AMB Japan receives asset management
    priority distributions equal to 1.5 percent per annum,
    payable on a quarterly basis, of the unreturned capital
    contributions. The amounts referred to above are reduced by
    amounts paid or accrued to AMB Singapore for management service
    fees pursuant to the Management Services Agreement and asset
    management fees paid or accrued to AMB Property Japan, pursuant
    to the Agreement Regarding Asset Management Fees.

Promptly following the Supplemental Capital Call Date, an asset
    management priority distribution recalculation will be performed
    as follows:

(i) For the period from July 1, 2006 through
    March 31, 2007 (the “First Calculation Period”),
    the asset management priority distribution will be recalculated
    based on the greater of 90.0 percent of the aggregate
    capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent of the
    unreturned capital contributions. If the recalculated asset
    management priority distribution is greater than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the First
    Calculation Period, a special payment equal to the difference
    shall be paid by the Fund to AMB Japan at the time of such
    recalculation. If the recalculated asset management priority
    distribution is equal to or less than the amount previously
    earned by AMB Japan with respect to the First Calculation
    Period, no additional amount shall be paid by the Fund to AMB
    Japan and no refund of such difference shall be paid by AMB
    Japan to the Fund.

(ii) For the period from April 1, 2007 through the
    Supplemental Capital Call Date (the “Second Calculation
    Period”), the asset management priority distribution will
    be recalculated based on the greater of 80.0 percent of the
    aggregate capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent
    of the unreturned capital contributions. If the recalculated
    asset management priority distribution is greater than the
    amount previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Second
    Calculation Period, a special payment equal to the difference
    shall be paid by the Fund to AMB Japan at the time of such
    recalculation. If the recalculated asset management priority
    distribution is equal to or less than the amount previously
    earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Second Calculation
    Period, no additional amount shall be paid by the Fund to AMB
    Japan and no refund of such difference shall be paid by AMB
    Japan to the Fund.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund recorded
    asset management priority distributions of approximately
    ¥460.2 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund
    owed ¥1.2 billion, for asset management priority
    distributions, which are included in distributions payable in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, AMB Japan
    receives incentive distributions equal to 20.0 percent of
    the amount over a 10.0 percent net nominal internal rate of
    return (“IRR”) accruing to the limited partners. The
    incentive distributions increase to 25.0 percent of the
    amount over a 13.0 percent IRR accruing to the limited
    partners. As of December 31, 2007, no incentive
    distributions have been paid or accrued.

AMB, the indirect owner of AMB Japan, obtains company-wide
    insurance coverage from third parties that apply to all
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including the Properties. As
    such, the Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance
    expense incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Fund recorded insurance expense of
    approximately ¥161.9 million.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. Management of the Fund believes that the
    policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate
    and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk
    of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Fund’s properties are located in
    areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Fund has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although the Fund has
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that management of the Fund
    believes are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the
    Fund will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Fund.

AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2006

1.

ORGANIZATION

On May 19, 2005, AMB Japan Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Japan”) and AMB Property II, L.P. as limited partner,
    formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the “Fund”), a
    Cayman Islands-exempted limited partnership. On June 30,
    2005 (“Inception”), 13 institutional investors were
    admitted as limited partners to the Fund and AMB Property II,
    L.P. withdrew as a limited partner.

On June 30, 2005, AMB Japan contributed its
    80.81 percent indirect equity interest with an agreed value
    of ¥11.9 billion in two operating properties (the
    “Properties”), consisting of six industrial buildings
    aggregating 0.9 million square feet (unaudited) to the Fund
    in exchange for a one percent general partnership interest in
    the Fund and ¥5.4 billion in cash. At Inception, the
    limited partners collectively made cash contributions of
    ¥5.7 billion to the Fund in exchange for a
    99.0 percent collective limited partnership interest in the
    Fund.

The limited partners have collectively committed
    ¥49.5 billion in equity to the Fund and AMB Japan, as
    general partner, has committed ¥0.5 billion in equity
    to the Fund. In addition, AMB Property Singapore Pte. Ltd.
    (“AMB Singapore”) has committed
    ¥11.9 billion in equity to co-invest with the Fund in
    properties. As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had completed
    four capital calls totaling ¥17.5 billion from the
    limited partners and non-cash contributions from the general
    partner totaling ¥0.2 billion, respectively.

The Fund and AMB Singapore co-invest (80.81 percent and
    19.19 percent, respectively) in Singapore private limited
    companies (“PTEs”) which indirectly own industrial
    real estate in Japan. The Properties are owned individually in
    Japanese Tokutei Mokuteki Kaishas (“TMKs”). TMKs are
    asset-backed entities subject to tax on income net of
    distributions. Distributions from TMKs to non-residents are
    subject to local withholding taxes.

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund indirectly owned
    80.81 percent of 12 operating buildings aggregating
    3.8 million square feet (unaudited). The Properties are
    located in the following submarkets of Tokyo: Funabashi,
    Kashiwa, Kawasaki, Narita, Ohta, and Saitama, and a submarket of
    Osaka: Amagasaki.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“U.S. GAAP”) in Yen currency. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the
    Fund and the joint ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s joint
    ventures are reflected as minority interests in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Functional and Reporting Currency.

The Yen is
    both the functional and reporting currency for the Fund’s
    operations. Functional currency is the currency of the primary
    economic environment in which the Fund operates. Monetary assets
    and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Yen are
    remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently

S-72


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future
    economic and market conditions and the availability of capital.
    If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to
    the carrying value of the Fund’s long-lived assets could
    occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To
    the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the
    carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is
    charged to income and is included on the consolidated statements
    of operations. There were no impairments of the carrying values
    of its investments in real estate as of December 31, 2006
    and 2005.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    investments in real estate. The estimated lives are as follows:

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Estimated Lives

Building and seismic costs

40 years

Parking, plumbing and utility

25 years

Expansions, roof, HVAC and other

20 years

Furniture, fixtures and other

10 years

Signage and common areas

7 years

Painting and other

5 years

Ground lease

Lesser of lease term or 40 years

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in the property
    including legal fees and acquisition costs.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

The Fund records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. At
    December 31, 2006, the Fund has recorded intangible assets
    and liabilities in the amounts of ¥111.0 million,
    ¥816.3 million, and ¥61.9 million for the
    value attributable to below-market leases, in-place leases, and
    lease origination costs, respectively, which are included in
    buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets. The value attributable to below-market leases is
    amortized over the average lease term, approximately
    3.9 years, and the amortization is included in rental
    revenues in the accompanying statements of operations. The value
    attributable to in-place leases and lease origination costs is
    amortized over the initial lease term, ranging from
    3.9 years to 9.9 years, and the amortization expense
    is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the
    accompanying statements of operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    reserves required to be held pursuant to Agreements with Chuo
    Mitsui Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. (“Chuo
    Mitsui”), JP Morgan Trust Bank, Ltd. (“JP
    Morgan”), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation
    (“SMBC”) and Shinsei Bank, Limited, as well as cash
    held in escrow under the terms of the Loan Agreement with JP
    Morgan. Pursuant to these agreements, minimum levels of cash are
    required to be held as reserves for operating expenses, real
    estate taxes and insurance reserves, consumption tax and
    maintenance reserves. Restricted cash also includes cash held
    directly by the Fund as collateral for a ¥2.6 billion
    secured loan payable in connection with the Fund’s
    acquisition of Higashi-Ogijima Distribution Center, which was
    acquired indirectly by an entity of which the Fund owns
    80.81 percent. Upon repayment of this secured loan payable,
    the cash will become unrestricted.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related debt. As of December 31, 2006,
    deferred financing costs were ¥547.3 million, net of
    accumulated amortization.

Financial Instruments.

SFAS No. 133,
    Accounting for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging
    Activities, provides comprehensive guidelines for the
    recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging
    activities and, specifically, requires all derivatives to be
    recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income or loss. The Fund’s derivative financial instruments
    in effect at December 31, 2006 were four interest rate
    swaps, hedging cash flows of the Fund’s variable rate bonds
    based on Tokyo Inter-bank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”) plus
    a margin. Adjustments to the fair value of these instruments for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted in a loss of
    ¥7.4 million, net of minority interest. There were no
    other derivative financial instruments included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income or loss for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. There was no impact on accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 as the Fund did not have any derivative
    financial instruments. This loss is included in accounts
    payables and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet and other comprehensive income in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of partners’ capital.

Mortgage and Bond Premiums.

Mortgage and bond
    premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt over the
    principal value of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions.
    The mortgage and bond premiums are being amortized into interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2006, the
    unamortized mortgage and bond premiums were approximately
    ¥57.4 million.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent a 19.19 percent indirect equity interest in the
    Properties held by AMB Singapore. Such investments are
    consolidated because the Fund owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Fund are allocated to each of the partners in accordance
    with the respective partnership agreements as amended. Partner
    distributions are expected to be made on a semi-annual basis
    when distributable proceeds are available. Distributions, other
    than priority distributions (Note 8), are made to each of
    the partners in accordance with their respective ownership
    interests at the time of the distribution.

Rental Revenues.

The Fund, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. The Fund recorded ¥28.4 million and
    ¥14.2 million of revenue related to the amortization
    of lease intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2006
    and for the period from Inception to December 31, 2005,
    respectively. The lease intangibles are being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Fund in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Fund’s ability to lease space and on
    the level of rent that can be achieved. The Fund had five
    tenants that accounted for 53.0 percent of rental revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Fund’s financial instruments include a mortgage loan
    payable, bonds payable and secured loans payable. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Fund at December 31, 2006,
    the estimated fair market value of the financial instruments was
    ¥53.4 billion.

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Fund acquired
    an 80.81 percent equity interest in entities that
    indirectly own four operating properties aggregating
    2.6 million square feet (unaudited) from AMB Japan. AMB
    Singapore retained 19.19 percent of the equity interest in
    the same entities. The total aggregate investment cost was
    approximately ¥57.1 billion, which includes
    ¥79.7 million closing costs. As of December 31,
    2006, the Fund owed AMB Japan ¥56.6 million which
    represents the unpaid portion of the purchase price
    (Note 8).

DEBT

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had one mortgage loan
    payable totaling ¥2.7 billion, not including an
    unamortized mortgage premium of approximately
    ¥25.5 million. The mortgage loan payable bears
    interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures in
    2011.

The mortgage loan payable is collateralized by certain of the
    Properties and requires interest only payments to be made
    quarterly until maturity in 2011. In addition, the mortgage loan
    payable has various covenants such as maintaining debt service
    coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.
    Management of the Fund believes that the Fund was in compliance
    with these covenants as of December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had one collateralized
    bond payable totaling ¥3.4 billion, not including an
    unamortized bond premium of ¥31.9 million. The bond
    bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures
    in 2011. Principal amortization on this bond begins in June 2007.

If at any such time, the principal outstanding on the
    ¥3.4 billion bond payable reaches the balance of the
    principal outstanding on the ¥2.7 billion mortgage
    loan payable, amortization of principal would then be applied on
    a pro rata basis of 50.0 percent to the bond payable and
    50.0 percent to the mortgage loan payable.

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had four collateralized
    specified bonds payable totaling ¥35.2 billion. The
    bonds bear interest at rates per annum equal to the rates of the
    TIBOR and Yen London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”)
    plus a margin ranging from 85 to 155 basis points and
    mature between 2012 and 2013. To hedge the cash flows of these
    floating rate borrowings, the Fund purchased interest swaps,
    which have fixed the interest rates payable on principal amounts
    totaling ¥31.2 billion at rates ranging from
    1.32 percent to 1.60 percent per annum. Including the
    interest rate swaps, the effective borrowing cost for the
    ¥35.2 billion bonds is 2.65 percent per annum.

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had secured loans payable
    totaling ¥12.4 billion:

(i) The ¥2.6 billion secured loan payable bears
    interest at a rate per annum equal to TIBOR plus a margin of
    20 basis points and matures in August 2007. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, the interest rate

S-75


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximated 0.410 percent per annum. The loan payable is
    secured by a restricted cash balance held directly by the Fund
    in a cash collateral account.

(ii) The ¥9.8 billion secured loan payable bears
    interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of
    75 basis points and matures in April 2008. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, the interest rate approximated
    1.14 percent per annum. The loan payable is secured by the
    partners’ capital commitment (“Credit Facility”).

    under Japanese Asset Liquidation law. As of December 31,
    2006, the seven TMKs included in the Fund’s consolidated
    financial statements are AMB Funabashi Tokorozawa TMK, AMB
    Higashi-Ogijima TMK, AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Narita 1-1 TMK, AMB
    Amagasaki TMK, AMB Kashiwa TMK and AMB Funabashi 6 TMK. The
    Properties owned by AMB Funabashi Tokorozawa TMK collateralize
    one mortgage loan payable and one bond payable. The secured loan
    payable held by AMB Higashi-Ogijima TMK is collateralized by
    cash directly held by the Fund in a cash collateral account. The
    properties owned by AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Narita 1-1 TMK, AMB
    Amagasaki TMK and AMB Kashiwa TMK collateralize bonds payable by
    the respective entities. The creditors of the TMKs do not have
    recourse to any other assets or revenues of AMB Japan or its
    affiliated entities. Conversely, the creditors of AMB Japan and
    its affiliated entities do not have recourse to any of the
    assets or revenues of the TMKs.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

During the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Japan
    contributed its equity interest in five Singapore PTE entities
    which owned an 80.81 percent indirect interest in four
    operating properties, aggregating 2.6 million square feet
    (unaudited) to the Fund. As of December 31, 2006, the Fund
    has an obligation of ¥56.6 million, payable to AMB
    Japan, related to the unpaid portion of the contribution value
    for the Singapore PTE entities, which is included in net
    payables to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheet.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Fund made debt
    financed distributions of ¥9.8 billion to AMB Japan
    related to the unpaid portion of the contributions value for the
    Singapore PTE entities contributed at Inception and during the
    year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2005,
    ¥2.6 billion was included in net payables to
    affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The contribution values of the Singapore PTEs contributed to the
    Fund at Inception were determined based on estimated fair market
    values of the net assets of each PTE as of June 30, 2005.
    Included in the fair market value determination of the Singapore
    PTE net assets was the fair market value of the Properties. The
    fair market value of the Properties was determined based on an
    appraisal conducted by an independent third party. In September
    2005, the June 30, 2005 estimated fair market values of the
    net assets of the PTEs were adjusted to reflect final valuations.

Pursuant to the Co-Investment Agreement, AMB Singapore has an
    obligation to contribute 19.19 percent in capital (debt or
    equity) towards acquisitions of properties. As of
    December 31, 2005, AMB Singapore had issued unsecured,
    non-interest bearing loans in the amount of
    ¥139.2 million to an 80.81 percent controlled
    subsidiary of the Fund as funding for acquisition of properties.
    During the year ended December 31, 2006, these loans were
    converted into equity in this subsidiary of the Fund.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
    Agreement and the Co-Investment Agreement, AMB Japan receives an
    acquisition fee equal to 0.9 percent of the Fund’s
    share of the acquisition cost of properties purchased from third
    parties. This acquisition fee is reduced by a 0.4 percent
    acquisition fee AMB Singapore receives of the acquisition cost
    of properties purchased from third parties who are referred to
    the Fund by AMB Singapore.

In relation to the acquisition of Higashi-Ogijima Distribution
    Center, AMB Higashi-Ogijima TMK paid an acquisition fee of
    ¥63.4 million to AMB Blackpine Ltd
    (“Blackpine”), a 50/50 joint venture between AMB
    Headlands Japan LLC, an indirect subsidiary of AMB Property
    Corporation (“AMB”), and a team of real estate
    professionals in Japan. During the year ended December 31,
    2006, AMB acquired the 50.0 percent of Blackpine that AMB
    did not previously own, and AMB has combined the operation of
    Blackpine with its wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary, AMB
    Property Japan, Inc., the Japan branch of AMB (“AMB
    Property Japan”). This acquisition fee was capitalized and
    included in investments in real estate in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2006, the
    unamortized acquisition fee was approximately
    ¥61.3 million.

In 2005, the TMKs recorded asset management fees and leasing
    commissions to Blackpine of approximately ¥7.2 million
    and ¥16.7 million, respectively. The leasing
    commissions were capitalized and included in investments real
    estate. As of December 31, 2006, the unamortized leasing
    commissions were approximately ¥12.6 million.
    Blackpine ceased providing asset management services to the TMKs
    on January 1, 2006.

Pursuant to an asset management fees agreement, on
    January 1, 2006, AMB Property Japan began providing asset
    management services to the Properties. The asset management fee
    is payable monthly. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    the Fund recorded asset management fees of approximately
    ¥54.5 million.

Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, AMB Singapore
    receives management service fees, payable on a quarterly basis,
    equal to 0.25 percent of capital (equity and debt)
    contributed to each PTE by the Fund and AMB Singapore. For the
    year ended December 31, 2006, and for the period from
    Inception to December 31, 2005, the PTEs recorded
    management service fees of approximately ¥18.6 million
    and ¥7.7 million, respectively. As of

    Agreement), and thereafter until the Supplement Call Date, the
    base will be the called but unreturned capital contributions.
    Subsequent to the Supplemental Capital Call Date, AMB Japan
    receives asset management priority distributions equal to
    1.5 percent per annum, payable on a quarterly basis, of the
    unreturned capital contributions. Both amounts referred to above
    are reduced by amounts paid or accrued to AMB Singapore for
    management service fees pursuant to the Management Services
    Agreement and asset management fees paid or accrued to AMB
    Property Japan, pursuant to the agreement regarding asset
    management fees. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the
    Fund recorded asset management priority distributions of
    approximately ¥654.4 million. For the period from
    Inception to December 31, 2005, the Fund recorded asset
    management priority distributions of approximately
    ¥367.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Fund
    owed ¥1.0 billion, for asset management priority
    distributions, which are included in distributions payable in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, AMB Japan
    receives incentive distributions equal to 20.0 percent of
    the amount over a 10.0 percent net nominal internal rate of
    return (“IRR”) accruing to the limited partners. The
    incentive distributions increase to 25.0 percent of the
    amount over a 13.0 percent IRR accruing to the limited
    partners. As of December 31, 2006, no incentive
    distributions have been paid or accrued.

AMB, the asset manager for AMB Japan, obtains company-wide
    insurance coverage from third parties that applies to all
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including the Properties. As
    such, the Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance
    expense incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated
    to the Properties amounted to ¥108.9 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 and ¥24.1 million
    for the period from Inception to December 31, 2005.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. Management of the Fund believes that the
    policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate
    and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk
    of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Fund’s properties are located in
    areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Fund has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war that may be either
    uninsurable or not

S-79


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

economically insurable. Although the Fund has obtained coverage
    for certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and
    insured limits that management of the Fund believes are
    commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the Fund will be
    able to collect under such policies. Should an uninsured loss
    occur, the Fund could lose its investment in, and anticipated
    profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has adopted certain
    policies with respect to insurance coverage and proceeds as part
    of its operating policies, which apply to properties owned or
    managed by AMB, including properties owned by the Fund.

10.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

Subsequent to December 31, 2006, the Fund acquired
    approximately ¥31.4 billion of operating properties,
    obtained secured loans payable and bonds payable of
    approximately ¥27.0 billion, and repaid
    ¥6.1 billion in bonds and secured loans payable, in
    the ordinary course of business.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2008

(Report not required)

1.

ORGANISATION

AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS (the “Fund”) was
    formed on May 31, 2007 (“Incorporation”) as a

fonds commun de placement

organised under the form of a

fonds d’ investissement specialisé

subject to
    the law of February 13, 2007 of the Grand Duchy of
    Luxembourg concerning specialised investment funds. The Fund is
    an unincorporated co-ownership of securities and other assets,
    managed in the interest of its co-owners (the
    “Unitholders”) by AMB Fund Management, S.à
    r.l. a Luxembourg private limited company (the “Management
    Company”), pursuant to the Management Regulations of the
    Fund, as the same may be modified or supplemented (“the
    Management Regulations”).

Between May 31, 2007 and June 11, 2007 no financial
    transactions took place within the Fund.

On June 12, 2007 (“Inception”), the Fund
    completed its first closing and accepted capital contributions
    from 20 Unitholders to acquire indirect real property interests.
    Also at Inception, AMB European Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Europe”) was admitted to the Fund as a Unitholder in
    exchange for the indirect contribution of 38 industrial
    buildings.

During the year ended December 31, 2008 four new
    Unitholders were admitted to the Fund. As of December 31,
    2008, the Fund had received capital contributions of
    approximately €394.8 million from 25 Unitholders in
    exchange for 390,005 Units in the Fund. Profits and
    distributions of the Fund are allocated to Unitholders as
    provided in the Management Regulations. AMB Europe owned an
    approximate 20.6 percent interest in the Fund as of
    December 31, 2008.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

The consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    Luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements for investment
    funds (“Lux GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position and results
    of operations of the Fund and the joint ventures in which the
    Fund has a controlling interest. Third party equity interests in
    the Fund’s joint ventures are reflected as minority
    interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
    All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated. All
    monetary figures are expressed in Euro.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with Lux GAAP requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Valuation of Real Estate Investments.

Real
    estate investments not publicly traded are carried at their
    estimated fair value in accordance with Lux GAAP.

The fair value of real estate investments held by the Fund are
    determined in accordance with the Fund’s appraisal policy
    (the “Appraisal Policy”) as approved by the Management
    Company and the three member independent council (the
    “Independent Council”) for the Fund. Under the
    Appraisal Policy, approximately one fourth of the Fund’s
    properties are valued by the Fund’s independent appraiser
    (the “Independent Appraiser”) each quarter, such that
    all properties are valued at least annually. With respect to all
    properties acquired by the Fund, the Management Company will
    determine the quarter during which each such property will first
    be appraised, provided that it is appraised within the first
    five calendar quarters beginning after the acquisition of such
    property by the Fund.

Appraisals are conducted by the Independent Appraiser in
    accordance with valuation principles set forth in the Appraisal
    and Valuation Manual as published by the Royal Institute of
    Chartered Surveyors or such other standards as may be proposed
    by the Management Company and approved by the Independent
    Council.

S-86


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Recently acquired investments are accounted for and carried at
    cost, including costs of acquisition plus capital expenditures
    subsequent to acquisition, as this is the best estimate of fair
    value.

Once a property has been appraised, the value of the property is
    the net value of the property shown in the appraisal, adjusted
    (if appropriate) to take into account unamortized closing costs
    and transfer tax savings, if any, resulting from the structure
    of the acquisition of the property, plus capital expenditures
    subsequent to the appraisal not otherwise taken into account in
    the appraisal. Closing costs are costs incurred in connection
    with the acquisition of a property indirectly through a share
    transaction or directly through an asset deal. Transfer tax
    savings result in certain cases depending on the structure of
    the acquisition transaction, and are assumed to generally be
    split between a buyer and a seller of real estate on a
    fifty-fifty basis, based on the estimated transfer taxes. The
    property values are reviewed and approved by the Management
    Company and the Independent Council.

Ultimate realisation of the fair values is dependent to a great
    extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond
    management’s control (such as general economic conditions,
    conditions affecting tenants and other events occurring in the
    markets in which individual properties are located). Further,
    values may or may not represent the prices at which the real
    estate investments would be sold since market prices of real
    estate investments can only be determined by negotiation between
    a willing buyer and seller.

Unrealised gains and losses are determined by comparing the fair
    value of the real estate investments to the total acquisition
    cost plus capital expenditures of such assets. Unrealised gains
    and losses relating to changes in fair value of the Fund’s
    real estate investments are reflected in the consolidated
    statement of operations as a component of unrealised gains and
    losses on investments in real estate.

Real Estate Transactions.

Purchases of real
    estate investments are recorded at the purchase price when
    beneficial ownership of the real estate has been transferred to
    the Fund. Deal costs in relation to pre-acquisition such as
    legal and other professional fees, appraisals and other direct
    expenses incurred for prospective acquisitions of properties are
    capitalised and included within the cost of the corresponding
    investment upon acquisition. In the event that the deal is
    abandoned, the costs are then charged to the consolidated
    statement of operations.

Capital Expenditures.

Expenditures which
    extend the economic life of the asset, or which represent
    additional capital improvements providing benefit in future
    periods (including tenant improvements) are capitalised together
    with the cost of investments purchased.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

All cash on hand,
    demand deposits with financial institutions and short term,
    highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow by notaries or in connection with reserves from
    loan proceeds for certain capital improvements and real estate
    tax payments.

Fund Formation Costs.

The formation costs
    of the Fund are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
    basis over a five-year period starting at Inception.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs resulting from
    debt issues are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
    basis over the period of the corresponding debt. Amortisation of
    deferred financing costs is included in Interest, including
    amortisation, in the consolidated statement of operations.

Deferred Tax Asset.

Deferred tax assets are
    included in the consolidated statements of net assets when it is
    highly probable that future taxable income will be recognised in
    the foreseeable future.

Taxation in Luxembourg.

The Fund is liable for
    a subscription tax of 0.01 percent per annum computed, and
    proportionately paid on its net asset value at the end of each
    quarter.

Luxembourg subsidiaries of the Fund are fully subject to
    Luxembourg taxes on income and net worth, however exemptions are
    available. Dividend payments to the Fund from the Luxembourg
    subsidiaries, if any, are subject to a

S-87


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

withholding tax of 15.0 percent. The tax implications have
    been discussed and agreed with the Luxembourg Tax Authorities
    and confirmed in an Advance Tax Agreement.

Taxation abroad.

Provisions for taxation are
    made for income earned by the Fund’s subsidiaries abroad on
    the basis of laws and regulations relating to taxation in the
    countries where the relevant net income is earned.

Deferred Tax Liability.

The deferred tax
    liability as of December 31, 2008 is related to built-in
    unrealised gains on the properties. The unrealised taxable gains
    are valued at the statutory tax rate for capital gains in the
    jurisdiction in which the property is located and reduced by
    50.0 percent to represent a customary buyer and seller
    split of proceeds on potential future dispositions.

Debt.

Debt consists of secured and unsecured
    external debt, if any, stated at face value, adjusted for
    unrealised gains or losses reflecting the change in the fair
    value of the debt.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent interests held by affiliates of AMB and third-party
    investors in various entities of the Fund. The Fund consolidates
    these investments because the Fund owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Unitholders’ Capital.

Profits and losses
    of the Fund are allocated to each of the Unitholders in
    accordance with the Management Regulations. Distributions to
    Unitholders are typically made quarterly. Distributions, other
    than incentive distributions (Note 14), are paid or accrued
    to each of the Unitholders in accordance with their respective
    Units owned at the time distributions are declared.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

The Fund may
    acquire derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to
    interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate loans. These
    financial instruments are recorded at fair value with any
    unrealised and realised gains or losses included in the
    consolidated statement of operations.

Rental Revenue and Income Recognition.

The
    Fund, as a lessor, retains substantially all of the benefits and
    risks of ownership of the Properties and accounts for its leases
    as operating leases. Rental income as well as rent incentives
    are recognised on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
    leases until the first break right, if any, in the lease.
    Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other
    recoverable operating expenses are recognised as revenue in the
    period that the applicable expenses are incurred. Interest
    income is recorded on an accrual basis. Interest received is
    stated net of withholding taxes. In addition, the Fund includes
    bad debt expense in property operating costs.

Foreign Currency.

Transactions in foreign
    currencies have been translated into Euros at the rates of
    exchange prevailing at the dates of those transactions.
    Settlement of transactions in foreign currencies, as well as
    translation of monetary assets or liabilities in foreign
    currency, may cause realised or unrealised exchange rate gains
    or losses, which are included in the consolidated statement of
    operations.

Foreign currency differences relating to the translation of net
    investments in foreign entities are treated as part of
    Unitholders’ capital. Balance sheets of foreign entities
    are translated at the rate as of the balance sheet date, whereas
    the statement of operations is translated at the average rate of
    the period under review.

Receivables from Affiliate and Payables to
    Affiliate.

Receivables from and payables to
    affiliates are shown on a gross basis on the consolidated
    statement of net assets.

AMB Property, L.P. (“AMB L.P.”) obtains various types
    of liability and property insurance for the benefit of the Fund.
    The insurance coverage includes Commercial General Liability
    Insurance, Umbrella Liability and Excess Liability Insurance and
    Broad Form All Risk Property Damage and Business
    Interruption Insurance, which include earthquake, flood,
    terrorism, and boiler and machinery. The Property Damage and
    Business Interruption Insurance provides for a $150 million
    each occurrence limit of liability subject to industry standard
    per occurrence and aggregate policy sub-limits, deductibles,
    definitions, exclusions and limitations. Property damage is
    valued on a replacement cost basis. Using this method for
    valuing loss, damages for a claim equal amount needed to replace
    the property using new materials without a reduction for
    depreciation.

AMB L.P. regularly evaluates the types and amounts of coverage
    that it carries, and to assess whether in AMB L.P.’s good
    faith discretion, the coverage and limits carried are
    appropriate for the Fund.

    Facility”), or secured term loans, in connection with
    properties located in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the
    Netherlands, Spain or the United Kingdom. Loan draws under
    Facility 1 bear interest at a rate of 65 basis points over
    the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) if
    advanced before December 12, 2007, 90 basis points
    over EURIBOR if advanced on or after December 12, 2007 but
    before December 23, 2008 and 150 basis points over
    ING’s cost of funds if drawn on or after December 23,
    2008, subject to further adjustments, and may occur until its
    maturity on April 30, 2014. Drawings under the Acquisition
    Facility bear interest at a rate of 180 basis points over
    ING’s cost of funds, subject to further adjustments, and
    are repayable within six months of the date of advance, unless
    extended. The Fund guarantees the Acquisition Facility and is a
    carve-out indemnitor with respect to the secured term loans.

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had
    €316.9 million in outstanding term loans under
    Facility 1, including €0 outstanding under the Acquisition
    Facility. Facility 1 contains customary and other affirmative
    and negative covenants, including financial reporting
    requirements and maintenance of specific ratios. The Management
    Company of the Fund believes that the Fund was in compliance
    with these financial covenants as of December 31, 2008.

On December 29, 2008, the Fund terminated a
    €142.0 million

364-day

multi-currency revolving facility with ING.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On August 9, 2007, the Fund executed with Aareal Bank A.G.
    a €275.0 million facility (“Facility 2”),
    which provides that certain of the Fund’s affiliates may
    borrow secured term loans in connection with properties located
    in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain or
    the United Kingdom. Drawings under Facility 2 may occur
    until its maturity on November 28, 2014, and those made in
    the first year bore interest at rates ranging from 75 basis
    points to 130 basis points over EURIBOR. The Fund is a
    carve-out indemnitor with respect to the secured term loans. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Fund had €164.7 million
    in outstanding term loans under Facility 2. Facility 2 contains
    customary and other affirmative covenants and negative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specific ratios. The Management Company of the
    Fund believes that the Fund was in compliance with these
    financial covenants as of December 31, 2008. In addition to
    both facilities, the Fund had two mortgage loans outstanding as
    of December 31, 2008 totaling €26.4 million,
    which mature between 2012 and 2017. As of December 31,
    2008, these loans are held with IKB Bank A.G. and Credit
    Fonciere de France for €13.1 million and
    €13.3 million, respectively. The mortgage loans with
    IKB Bank A.G. are also secured with bank guarantees in the
    amount of €3.3 million, which have been issued off of
    a line of credit by AMB L.P. These mortgage loans, together with
    the loans outstanding under the facilities, bear interest at a
    weighted average rate of 4.96 percent as of
    December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund’s total outstanding
    debt was approximately €508.0 million, which includes
    €375.9 million and €132.1 million fixed and
    floating interest rate debt, respectively, and excludes
    €7.7 million of favourable fair value adjustments. The
    fixed interest rate debt includes €357.9 million of
    debt for which the variable interest rate was swapped to a fixed
    rate (Note 5).

Adjustments to the fair value of the outstanding debt and
    related derivative financial instruments (Note 5) for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted in net unrealised
    gains of approximately €4.7 million.

The scheduled principal payments of the Fund’s mortgage
    loans payable as of December 31, 2008 were as follows:

    borrowings based on EURIBOR plus a margin. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Fund entered into two interest rate
    swaps with Aareal Bank A.G. which had effective commencement
    dates of January 31, 2008 and April 4, 2008,

FUND NET
    ASSET VALUE

The net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund is determined
    based on the values of the Properties (determined in accordance
    with the Appraisal Policy), and takes into account, among other
    things, the value of the Fund’s cash and short-term
    investments, an intangible asset valued based on the formation
    costs of the Fund, the carrying value of all other assets of the
    Fund, and the liabilities of the Fund, including an adjustment
    to reflect the cost or value on any above- or below- market
    indebtedness of the Fund, a ratable portion of the present value
    of the projected incentive distribution, and a provision for
    deferred tax liabilities relating to the acquisition of
    properties as determined in accordance with the Appraisal Policy.

The Fund’s NAV is determined by the Investment Advisor (as
    defined in Note 14) and is reviewed and approved by the
    Management Company and the Independent Council.

Also under the Management Regulations, the Management Company is
    entitled to receive an acquisition fee (the “Acquisition
    Fee”) in an amount equal to 0.9 percent of the

    identifying, analysing, recommending and closing the purchase of
    properties acquired directly or indirectly by the Fund from a
    third party. Acquisition Fees are capitalised and included in
    investments in real estate in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of net assets. The Fund capitalised Acquisition Fees
    of approximately €0.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement (the
    “Advisory Agreement”), the Management Company has
    retained AMB Property Europe B.V. (the “Investment
    Advisor”) to provide operations and asset management
    services and acquisition advisory services to the Fund and its
    subsidiaries and fund advisory services to the Management
    Company. To the extent services are provided directly to the

    without duplication, directly to the subsidiaries to which the
    services are provided.

At certain properties, affiliates of AMB L.P. are responsible
    for the property management or the accounting or both. On a
    quarterly basis, affiliates of AMB L.P. earn property management
    fees between 0.1 percent and 2.8 percent of the
    respective property’s base rent. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, affiliates of AMB L.P. earned property
    management fees of approximately €1.0 million.

At certain properties, affiliates of AMB L.P. earn construction
    management fees when it has acted as the project manager. During
    the year ended December 31, 2008, affiliates of AMB L.P.
    earned construction management fees of approximately
    €0.1 million.

At certain properties, affiliates of AMB L.P. earn a leasing

    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 25.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2008, no incentive distribution has been paid to AMB Europe.

16.  COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

On November 25, 2008, a tenant (the “Tenant”) at
    the AMB BRU Cargo Center filed a lawsuit against AMB BRU Air
    Cargo Center BVBA (“BRU Cargo”), the owner of the
    facility, alleging various claims for damages in the amount of
    approximately E 0.6 million arising from the construction
    of the expansion works at the facility. BRU Cargo has required
    N.V. Cosimco (“Cosimco”), the general contractor for
    the expansion works, and Guido Peters (the “Construction
    Manager”), the construction manager for the expansion
    works, to intervene in the proceedings on behalf of BRU Cargo,
    and BRU Cargo has filed indemnification claims against Cosimco
    and the Construction Manager with respect to the lawsuit.

Neither BRU Cargo nor the Fund has accrued any amounts related
    to the litigation with the Tenant. BRU Cargo for itself and on
    behalf of the Fund intends to vigorously defend itself against
    the claims.

Forward Commitments.

On September 27,
    2008, the Fund entered into a forward commitment agreement to
    purchase the shares of Cargoport Grundstücks GmbH
    (“Cargoport”) upon the completion of a two-story
    warehouse facility by the seller on land ground leased by
    Cargoport and located in the Frankfurt market. The completion is
    currently scheduled for the third quarter 2009. The purchase
    price of the building amounts to approximately
    €59.7 million upon completion. The payment of the
    purchase price of the shares will take place at completion and
    is based on the net asset value of Cargoport. In addition, upon
    closing of the acquisition, the Fund’s acquiring subsidiary
    will assume the Cargoport ground lease and commence paying
    ground lease rent payments of approximately
    €0.3 million per year, for the duration of the ground
    lease expiring in 2067. The building has been pre-leased in its
    entirety, with a tenant lease term of ten years, with an option
    to renew.

Other Commitments.

One of the Fund’s
    subsidiaries has granted a lease incentive to its lessee for an
    amount of €0.6 million as a contribution towards
    improvements to be made by the lessee to the premises. This
    amount will be paid upon receipt of a specified invoice from
    lessee in cash.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows AMB
    L.P.’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on The Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. The Fund believes that the policy terms and
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and industry practice. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts
    of war that may be either uninsurable or not economically
    insurable. Although the Fund has obtained coverage for certain
    acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits
    that the Fund believes are commercially reasonable, it is not
    certain that the Fund will be able to collect under such
    policies. Should an uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose
    its investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from,
    a property. AMB Europe has adopted certain policies with respect
    to insurance coverage and proceeds as part of its operating
    policies, which apply to properties owned or managed by AMB
    Europe, including properties owned by the Fund.

DIFFERENCES
    FROM UNITED STATES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“US GAAP”). The approximate effect of these principal
    differences on the Fund’s Consolidated

AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Statement of Net Assets and Consolidated Statement of Operations
    are quantified below and described in the accompanying notes.

A.

The
    differences between US GAAP and Luxembourg GAAP are summarised
    as follows:

Under US GAAP:

•

Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at
    cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be
    recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is
    reduced to estimated fair value. At acquisition an intangible
    asset or liability for the value attributable to above or
    below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs
    for all acquisitions is recorded. Carrying values for financial
    reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period
    in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property
    is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property
    over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings.

•

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are owned by federal, state
    or local port authorities, and subject to ground leases are
    depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual
    term of the underlying ground lease. Depreciation of tenant
    improvements is recorded of the remaining lease term.
    Amortisation of above and below-market leases is recorded in
    rental revenues over the average remaining lease term. In-place
    leases are amortised over the average remaining lease term.

•

Debt premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt
    over the principal value of debt assumed in connection with the
    Fund’s formation and subsequent property acquisitions. The
    debt premiums are being amortised as an offset to interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest
    method. Costs incurred related to

start-up

activities, including organizational costs, are expensed as
    incurred. Costs incurred relating to raising capital are
    recorded as an offset to Unitholderss Capital. Financial
    instruments are recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and for Hedging Activities. This standard provides comprehensive
    guidelines for the recognition and measurement of derivatives
    and hedging activities and, specifically, requires all
    derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as
    an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss.

•

Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets can be recorded as
    an offset to deferred tax assets. The Fund is not subject to tax
    and therefore does not record deferred tax liability related to
    the ultimate sale of assets.

Under Luxembourg GAAP:

•

All real estate investments, including debt investments and
    derivatives, are revalued to fair market value and the premium
    generated from the acquisition of entities at a price below fair
    market value of acquired assets and liabilities is recognised as
    an unrealised gain.

•

Organizational costs and other fund formation costs are
    capitalized and amortised on a straight-line basis over a
    5 year period.

To the Unitholders of

AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of net
    assets, operations, changes in net assets and cash flows,
    present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2007, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for the period from May 31, 2007 to
    December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in Luxembourg. These financial statements are
    the responsibility of the Board of Managers of AMB
    Fund Management S.à r.1. (the “Management
    Company”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
    these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
    audit of these statements in accordance with the standards of
    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
    obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS OF
    DECEMBER 31, 2007

1.

ORGANISATION

AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS (the “Fund”) was
    formed on May 31, 2007 (“Incorporation”) as a

fonds commun de placement

organised under the form of a

fonds d’ investissement specialisé

subject to
    the law of February 13, 2007 of the Grand Duchy of
    Luxembourg concerning specialised investment funds. The Fund is
    an unincorporated co-ownership of securities and other assets,
    managed in the interest of its co-owners (the
    “Unitholders”) by AMB Fund Management, S.à
    r.l. a Luxembourg private limited company (the “Management
    Company”), pursuant to the Management Regulations of the
    Fund, as the same may be modified or supplemented (“the
    Management Regulations”).

Between May 31, 2007 and June 11, 2007 no financial
    transactions took place within the Fund.

On June 12, 2007 (“Inception”), the Fund
    completed its first closing and accepted capital contributions
    from 20 Unitholders to acquire indirect real property
    interests. Also at Inception, AMB European Investments, LLC
    (“AMB Europe”) was admitted to the Fund as a
    Unitholder in exchange for the indirect contribution of 38
    industrial buildings. At Inception, total equity committed to
    the Fund by all Unitholders, including AMB Europe, was
    €315.1 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund
    had received capital contributions of approximately
    €284.3 million in exchange for 283,675 Units in the
    Fund. Profits and distributions of the Fund are allocated to
    Unitholders as provided in the Management Regulations. AMB
    Europe owned an approximate 21.4 percent interest in the
    Fund as of December 31, 2007.

2.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

The consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    Luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements (“Lux
    GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements
    include the financial position and results of operations of the
    Fund and the joint ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s joint
    ventures are reflected as minority interests in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated. All monetary figures are expressed
    in Euro.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with Lux GAAP requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Valuation of Real Estate Investments.

Real
    estate investments not publicly traded are carried at their
    estimated fair value in accordance with Luxembourg legal and
    regulatory requirements for investment funds.

The fair value of real estate investments held by the Fund are
    determined in accordance with the Fund’s appraisal policy
    as approved by the Management Company and the three member
    Independent Council for the Fund (the “Appraisal
    Policy”). Under the Appraisal Policy, approximately one
    fourth of the Fund’s properties are valued by the
    Fund’s independent appraiser (the “Independent
    Appraiser”) each quarter, such that all properties are
    valued at least annually. With respect to all properties
    acquired by the Fund, the Management Company will determine the
    quarter during which each such property will first be appraised,
    provided that it is appraised within the first five calendar
    quarters beginning after the acquisition of such property by the
    Fund.

Appraisals are conducted by the Independent Appraiser in
    accordance with valuation principles set forth in the Appraisal
    and Valuation Manual as published by the Royal Institute of
    Chartered Surveyors or such other standards as may be proposed
    by the Management Company and approved by the Independent
    Council.

Recently acquired investments are accounted for and carried at
    cost, including costs of acquisition plus capital expenditures
    subsequent to acquisition, as this is the best estimate of fair
    value.

S-105


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Once a property has been appraised, the value of the property is
    the net value of the property shown in the appraisal, adjusted
    (if appropriate) to take into account unamortized closing costs
    and transfer tax savings, if any, resulting from the structure
    of the acquisition of the property, plus capital expenditures
    subsequent to the appraisal not otherwise taken into account in
    the appraisal. Closing costs are costs incurred in connection
    with the acquisition of a property indirectly through a share
    transaction or directly through an asset deal. Transfer tax
    savings result in certain cases depending on the structure of
    the acquisition transaction, and are assumed to generally be
    split between a buyer and a seller of real estate, of the
    estimated transfer taxes on a fifty-fifty basis. The property
    values are reviewed and approved by the Management Company and
    the Independent Council.

Ultimate realisation of the fair values is dependent to a great
    extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond
    management’s control (such as general economic conditions,
    conditions affecting tenants and other events occurring in the
    markets in which individual properties are located). Further,
    values may or may not represent the prices at which the real
    estate investments would be sold since market prices of real
    estate investments can only be determined by negotiation between
    a willing buyer and seller.

Unrealised gains and losses are determined by comparing the fair
    value of the real estate investments to the total acquisition
    cost plus capital expenditures of such assets and are shown net
    of deferred tax liabilities. Unrealised gains and losses
    relating to changes in fair value of the Fund’s real estate
    investments are reflected in the consolidated statement of
    operations as a component of unrealised gains and losses on
    investments in real estate.

Real Estate Transactions.

Purchases of real
    estate investments are recorded at purchase price when title to
    the real estate has been transferred to the Fund. Deal costs in
    relation to pre-acquisition such as legal and other professional
    fees, appraisals and other direct expenses incurred for
    prospective acquisitions of properties are capitalised and
    included within the cost of the corresponding investment upon
    acquisition. In the event that the deal is abandoned, the costs
    are then charged to the consolidated statement of operations.

Capital Expenditures.

Expenditures which
    extend the economic life of the asset, or which represent
    additional capital improvements providing benefit in future
    periods (including tenant improvements) are capitalised together
    with the cost of investments purchased.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

All cash on hand,
    demand deposits with financial institutions and short term,
    highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow by notaries or in connection with reserves from
    loan proceeds for certain capital improvements and real estate
    tax payments.

Fund Formation Costs.

The formation costs
    of the Fund are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
    basis over a five-year period starting at Inception.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs resulting from
    debt issues are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
    basis over the period of the corresponding debt.

Deferred Tax Asset.

Deferred tax assets are
    included in the consolidated statement of net assets when it is
    probable that future taxable income will be recognised in the
    foreseeable future.

Taxation in Luxembourg.

The Fund is liable for
    a subscription tax of 0.01 percent per annum computed, and
    proportionately paid on its net assets value at the end of each
    quarter.

Luxembourg subsidiaries of the Fund are fully subject to
    Luxembourg taxes on income and net worth, however exemptions are
    available. Dividend payments to the Fund from the Luxembourg
    subsidiaries, if any, are subject to a withholding tax of
    15.0 percent. The tax implications have been discussed and
    agreed with the Luxembourg Tax Authorities and confirmed in an
    Advance Tax Agreement.

S-106


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Taxation abroad.

Provisions for taxation are
    made for income earned by the Fund’s subsidiaries abroad on
    the basis of laws and regulations relating to taxation in the
    countries where the relevant net income is earned.

Deferred Tax Liability.

The deferred tax
    liability as of December 31, 2007 is related to built-in
    unrealised gain on the properties. The unrealised taxable gains
    are valued at the statutory tax rate for capital gains in the
    jurisdiction in which the property is located and reduced by
    50.0 percent to represent a customary buyer and seller
    split of proceeds on potential future dispositions.

Debt.

Debt consists of external secured debt
    stated at face value, adjusted for unrealised gains or losses
    reflecting the change in the fair market value of the debt.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent interests held by affiliates of AMB and third-party
    investors in various entities of the Fund. The Fund consolidates
    these investments because the Fund owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Unitholders’ Capital.

Profits and losses
    of the Fund are allocated to each of the Unitholders in
    accordance with the Management Regulations. Distributions to
    Unitholders are typically made quarterly. Distributions, other
    than incentive distributions (Note 14), are paid or accrued
    to each of the Unitholders in accordance with their respective
    units owned at the time distributions are declared.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

The Fund may
    acquire derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to
    interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate loans. These
    financial instruments are recorded at fair value with any
    unrealised and realised gains or losses included in the
    consolidated statement of operations.

Rental Revenue and Income Recognition.

The
    Fund, as a lessor, retains substantially all of the benefits and
    risks of ownership of the Properties and accounts for its leases
    as operating leases. Rental income as well as rent incentives
    are recognised on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
    leases until the first break right, if any, in the lease.
    Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other
    recoverable operating expenses are recognised as revenue in the
    period that the applicable expenses are incurred. Interest
    income is recorded on an accrual basis. Interest received is
    stated net of withholding taxes. In addition, the Fund includes
    bad debt expense in property operating costs.

Foreign currency translation.

Transactions on
    foreign currencies have been translated into Euros at the rates
    of exchange prevailing at the dates of those transactions.

INVESTMENTS
    IN REAL ESTATE

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund owned 55 industrial
    buildings aggregating 762,918 rentable square meters
    (unaudited) (the “Properties”). The Properties are
    located in the following markets: Amsterdam, Brussels,
    Frankfurt, Hamburg, Lyon, Paris and Rotterdam.

During the period from Incorporation to December 31, 2007,
    the Fund acquired 17 industrial buildings totaling
    324,380 square meters (unaudited). The total aggregate
    investment was approximately €293.9 million, which
    includes approximately €2.2 million in closing costs
    and acquisition fees related to these acquisitions.

For the period from Incorporation to December 31, 2007,
    nine properties were valued or revalued, resulting in an
    increase in the fair market value of approximately
    €6.1 million. In accordance with the Appraisal Policy
    the Management Company did not consider any off-cycle appraisals

AMB Property L.P. (“AMB L.P.”) obtains various types
    of liability and property insurance for the benefit of the Fund.
    The insurance coverage includes Commercial General Liability
    Insurance, Umbrella Liability and Excess Liability Insurance and
    Broad Form All Risk Property Damage and Business
    Interruption Insurance, which include earthquake, flood,
    terrorism, and boiler and machinery. The Property Damage and
    Business Interruption Insurance provides for a $150,000,000 each
    occurrence limit of liability subject to industry standard per
    occurrence and aggregate policy sub-limits, deductibles,
    definitions, exclusions and limitations. Property damage is
    valued on a replacement cost basis. Using this method for
    valuing loss, damages for a claim equal amount needed to replace
    the property using new materials without a reduction for
    depreciation.

AMB L.P. regularly evaluates the types and amounts of coverage
    that it carries, and to assess whether in AMB L.P.’s good
    faith discretion, the coverage and limits carried are
    appropriate for the Fund.

DEBT

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had a
    €428.0 million credit facility with ING Bank N.V.
    (“Facility 1”), which provides that certain of the
    Fund’s affiliates may borrow either acquisition loans, up
    to a €100.0 million sub-limit (the “Acquisition
    Loan Facility”), or secured term loans, in connection with
    properties located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,
    the United Kingdom, Italy, or Spain. Loan draws under Facility 1
    bear interest at a rate of 65 basis points over EURIBOR and
    may occur until its maturity on April 30, 2014. Drawings
    under the Acquisition Loan Facility bear interest at a rate of
    75 basis points over EURIBOR and are repayable within six
    months of the date of advance, unless extended. The Fund
    guarantees the Acquisition Loan Facility and is a carve-out
    indemnitor with respect to the secured term loans. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Fund had €295.9 million in
    outstanding term loans under Facility 1, including
    €24.7 million outstanding under the Acquisition Loan
    Facility. Facility 1 contains customary and other affirmative
    covenants and negative covenants, including financial reporting
    requirements and maintenance of specific ratios. The Management
    Company of the Fund believes that it was in compliance with
    these financial covenants as of December 31, 2007.

On August 9, 2007, the Fund executed with Aareal Bank A.G.
    a €275.0 million facility (“Facility 2”),
    which provides that certain of the Fund’s affiliates may
    borrow secured term loans in connection with properties located
    in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United
    Kingdom, Italy or Spain. Drawings under Facility 2 may
    occur until its maturity on November 28, 2014, and those
    made in the first year are expected to bear interest at a rate
    of 75 basis points over EURIBOR. The Fund is a carve-out
    indemnitor in respect to the secured term loans. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Fund had €133.0 million in
    outstanding term loans under Facility 2. Facility 2 contains
    customary and other affirmative covenants and negative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specific ratios.

In addition to both facilities, the Fund had two mortgage loans
    outstanding, as of December 31, 2007 totaling
    €28.3 million, which mature between 2008 and 2017.
    These loans are held with IKB Bank A.G. and Credit Fonciere de
    France for €13.9 million and €14.4 million,
    respectively. These mortgage loans, together with the loans
    outstanding under both facilities, bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.1 percent.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund’s derivative
    financial instruments included two interest rate swaps with ING
    Bank N.V. and IKB Bank A.G., that hedged the cash flows of the
    Fund’s variable rate borrowings based on EURIBOR plus a
    margin. The Fund also entered into an interest rate swap with
    Aareal Bank A.G. , which will have an effective commencement
    date of January 31, 2008. Adjustments to the fair value of
    these instruments for the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007 resulted in a net unrealised gain of
    approximately €3.0 million.

    26.38 percent to 15.83 percent, effective as of
    January 1, 2008. Accordingly, the unrealised gain was
    measured using this new rate at which the deferred tax liability
    will reverse in the future.

FUND NET
    ASSET VALUE

The net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund is determined
    based on the values of the properties (determined in accordance
    with the Appraisal Policy), and takes into account, among other
    things, the value of the Fund’s cash and short-term
    investments, an intangible asset valued based on the formation
    costs of the Fund, the carrying value of all other assets of the
    Fund, and the liabilities of the Fund, including an adjustment
    to reflect the cost or value on any above- or below- market
    indebtedness of the Fund, a ratable portion of the present value
    of the projected incentive distribution, and a provision for
    deferred tax liabilities relating to the acquisition of
    properties as determined in accordance with the Appraisal
    Policy. The Fund’s NAV is determined by the Investment
    Advisor (as defined in Note 14) and is reviewed and
    approved by the Management Company and the Independent Council.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

Pursuant to the Management Regulations, the Management Company
    is entitled to receive an annual management fee (the
    “Management Fee”), payable quarterly in arrears, in an
    amount equal to 0.75 percent per annum of the gross value
    of the Fund’s assets (determined in accordance with the
    Management Regulations) as of the end of each calendar quarter.
    The Fund incurred Management Fees of approximately
    €3.0 million for the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007.

Also under the Management Regulations, the Management Company is
    entitled to receive an acquisition fee (the “Acquisition
    Fee”) in an amount equal to 0.9 percent of the
    acquisition cost of properties acquired by the Fund for
    identifying, analyzing, recommending and closing the purchase of
    properties acquired directly or indirectly by the Fund from a
    third party. Acquisition Fees are capitalised and included in
    investments in real estate in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of net assets. During the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007, the Fund capitalised approximately
    €1.3 million in acquisition fees.

Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement (the
    “Advisory Agreement”), the Management Company has
    retained AMB Property Europe B.V. (the “Investment
    Advisor”) to provide operations and asset management
    services and acquisition advisory services to the Fund and its
    subsidiaries and fund advisory services to the Management
    Company. To the extent services are provided directly to the
    subsidiaries of the Fund, the Investment Advisor or its
    affiliated delegates providing such services may charge fees,
    without duplication, directly to the subsidiaries to which the
    services are provided.

At certain properties, affiliates of AMB L.P. are responsible
    for the property management or the accounting or both. On a
    quarterly basis, AMB L.P. earns property management fees between
    0.1 percent and 2.8 percent of the respective
    property’s base rent. For the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007, AMB L.P. earned property management fees
    of approximately €0.3 million.

At certain properties, AMB L.P. earns a leasing commission when
    it has acted as the listing broker or the procuring broker or
    both. During the period from Incorporation to December 31,
    2007, AMB L.P. earned no leasing commissions.

Commencing June 30, 2010 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB Europe is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    20.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 25.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2007, no incentive distribution has been paid to AMB Europe. The
    Fund accrued approximately €0.9 million in incentive
    distributions to AMB Europe for the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007.

AMB L.P. has a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. (“Arcata”), which provides
    insurance coverage for a portion of losses under our third-party
    policies. AMB L.P. capitalised Arcata in accordance with the
    applicable regulatory requirements. Annually, AMB L.P. engages
    an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of
    future projected claims, related deductibles and projected
    expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB L.P. based on AMB L.P.’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated
    to the Properties was approximately €0.3 million for
    the period from Incorporation to December 31, 2007.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows AMB
    L.P.’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on The Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can

S-113


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

be no assurance that such a material environmental liability
    does not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. The Fund believes that the policy terms and
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and industry practice. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts
    of war that may be either uninsurable or not economically
    insurable. Although the Fund has obtained coverage for certain
    acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits
    that the Fund believes are commercially reasonable, it is not
    certain that the Fund will be able to collect under such
    policies. Should an uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose
    its investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from,
    a property. AMB Europe has adopted certain policies with respect
    to insurance coverage and proceeds as part of its operating
    policies, which apply to properties owned or managed by AMB
    Europe, including properties owned by the Fund.

17.

Differences
    from United States Accounting Principles

Luxembourg GAAP varies in certain significant respects from the
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“US GAAP”). The approximate effect of these principal
    differences on the Fund’s Audited Consolidated Statement of
    Net Assets and Audited Consolidated Statement of Operations are
    quantified below and described in the accompanying notes.

A.  The
    differences between US GAAP and Luxembourg GAAP are summarised
    as follows:

Under US GAAP:

•

Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at
    cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be
    recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is
    reduced to estimated fair value. At acquisition an intangible
    asset or liability for the value attributable to above or
    below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs
    for all acquisitions is recorded. Carrying values for financial
    reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period
    in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property
    is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property
    over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings.

•

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are owned by federal, state
    or local port authorities, and subject to ground leases are
    depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual
    term of the underlying ground lease. Depreciation of tenant
    improvements is recorded of the remaining lease term.
    Amortisation of above and below-market leases is recorded in
    rental revenues over the average remaining lease term. In-place
    leases are amortised over the average remaining lease term.

•

Debt premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt
    over the principal value of debt assumed in connection with the
    Fund’s formation and subsequent property acquisitions. The
    debt premiums are being amortised as an offset to interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest
    method. Costs incurred related to

start-up

activities, including organizational costs, are expensed as
    incurred. Costs incurred relating to raising capital are
    recorded as an offset to Unitholderss Capital. Financial
    instruments are recorded in accordance with

S-114


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and for Hedging Activities. This standard provides comprehensive
    guidelines for the recognition and measurement of derivatives
    and hedging activities and, specifically, requires all
    derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as
    an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss.

•

Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets can be recorded as
    an offset to deferred tax assets. The Fund is not subject to tax
    and therefore does not record deferred tax liability related to
    the ultimate sale of assets.

Under Luxembourg GAAP:

•

All real estate investments, including debt investments and
    derivatives, are revalued to fair market value and the premium
    generated from the acquisition of entities at a price below fair
    market value of acquired assets and liabilities is recognised as
    an unrealised gain.

•

Organizational costs and other fund formation costs are
    capitalized and amortised on a straight-line basis over a
    5 year period.

•

Deferred tax liabilities are recorded on unrealized taxable
    gains at the statutory tax rate for capital gains in the
    property’s jurisdiction and reduced by 50% to represent a
    customary buyer and seller split of proceeds on potential future
    dispositions.

•

1.

ORGANIZATION

On December 31, 2004 (“Date of Inception”), AMB
    Property, L.P. (“AMB”) and Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte
    Ltd (“GIC”), formed AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, a Delaware
    limited liability company (the “Company”), for the
    purpose of investing in industrial properties in Mexico.

At the Date of Inception, AMB and GIC made cash equity
    contributions, net of transaction costs, of $1.5 million
    and $6.2 million, respectively, and acquired three
    properties comprised of eight buildings totaling
    1.3 million square feet (unaudited).

Pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the
    “Agreement”), AMB and GIC have investment capital
    commitments to the Company of $50.0 million and
    $200.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008,
    the remaining investment capital commitments from AMB and GIC
    were $24.6 million and $98.1 million, respectively.

AMB is the general manager of the Company with a
    19.19 percent managing member and limited member interest.
    GIC is an 80.81 percent limited member. According to the
    Agreement, the term of the Company will continue until
    December 31, 2011, unless extended or terminated sooner as
    provided for in the Agreement. AMB provides asset and portfolio
    management services for the Company’s real estate
    investments.

The Company owns 99.0 percent of the membership interests
    in the following Delaware limited liability corporations: AMB
    Mexico, L.L.C., AMB Chapala, LLC, AMB GDL 1, LLC, AMB
    Ferrocarril, LLC, AMB Corregidora, LLC, AMB Frontera, LLC, AMB
    Arbolada, LLC, AMB Los Altos 1, LLC, AMB Ocotillo, LLC and AMB
    GDL 2, LLC (the “U.S. LLCs”). In connection with
    the Company’s holdings in AMB Ferrocarril, LLC and in
    accordance with the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability
    Company Agreement, AMB will be treated as if it had contributed
    a 99.0 percent membership interest in the U.S. LLCs in
    exchange for the real estate assets held by the Mexican limited
    liability entities covered under the Agreement. The
    U.S. LLCs in turn hold a 98.0 percent equity interest
    in the following Mexican limited liability entities (the
    “SRLs”): AMB Acción San Martín
    Obispo I, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB- Acción Centro
    Logístico Parque 1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción GDL
    1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción San Martin Obispo
    II, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Corregidora Distribution
    Center, S. de R.L. de C.V. , AMB-Acción Apodaca Industrial
    Park 2, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Arbolada
    Distribution Center, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Los
    Altos Industrial Park 1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB Ocotillo, S. de
    R.L. de C.V. and AMB Acción GDL 2, de R.L. de C.V.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company owned 26 industrial
    buildings (the “Properties”), 13 in Guadalajara, 11 in
    Mexico City, 1 in Queretaro and 1 in Tijuana, totaling
    approximately 6.3 million square feet (unaudited).

2.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of the Company and the Company’s
    controlled subsidiaries. Non-controlling membership interests
    are reflected as minority interests in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and
    Transactions.

The U.S. dollar is the
    functional currency for the Company’s Mexican operations as
    it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which
    the Company

S-123


AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Mexican
    pesos are remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance
    sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are reported at
    historical U.S. dollar balances. Income and expenses
    denominated in Mexican pesos are remeasured in a manner that
    approximates the weighted average exchange rates for the
    quarter. Foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains
    and losses are included in other (expense) income in the
    consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008 the Company reported foreign currency
    remeasurement and transaction losses of approximately
    $1.2 million.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economic and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of the Company’s long-lived assets could occur in the
    future period in which assumptions change. To the extent that a
    property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the
    property over its estimated fair value is charged to income and
    is included on the consolidated statement of operations. The
    management of the Company believes that there were no
    impairments of the carrying value of its investments in real
    estate as of December 31, 2008.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or improvements
    that extend the economic useful life of assets are capitalized.

The Company records at acquisition an intangible asset for the
    value attributable to in-place leases and lease origination
    costs. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded
    intangible assets in the amounts of $7.8 million for the
    value attributable to in-place leases and $9.5 million for
    the value attributable to lease origination costs, which are
    included in buildings and improvements in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    term of the related loan. As of December 31, 2008, deferred
    financing costs were $1.3 million, net of accumulated
    amortization.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent interests held by AMB and AMB Property Mexico
    (“AMB Mexico”), formerly known as G. Acción, S.A.
    de C.V. (“G. Acción”), in various Company
    entities. Such investments are consolidated because the Company
    owns a majority interest and exercises control through the
    ability to control major operating decisions.

S-124


AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Members’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Company are allocated to each of the members in accordance
    with the Agreement. Distributions are made to each of the
    members in accordance with the Agreement.

Rental Revenues.

The Company, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period in which the applicable
    expenses are incurred. In addition, the Company nets its bad
    debt expense against rental income for financial reporting
    purposes. No bad debt expense was recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Income Taxes.

No provision for
    U.S. federal income taxes has been recorded on the books of
    the Company, since the members’ respective shares of
    taxable income are reportable by the members on their respective
    tax returns. The Company accounts for Mexican income taxes for
    its Mexican subsidiaries using the asset and liability method.
    Under this method, income and flat taxes are provided for
    amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred as tax assets
    and liabilities based on differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets
    and liabilities and the value of net operating loss
    carry-forward balances. Deferred income taxes are measured using
    the tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the
    temporary differences will reverse

and/or

the
    net operating loss carry-forward balances will be utilized. A
    valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to
    amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Company in
    its trade areas. The existence of competing properties could
    have a material impact on the Company’s ability to lease
    space and on the level of rent that can be received. The Company
    has one tenant that accounted for 14.1 percent of rental
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s financial instruments
    include mortgage loans payable and unsecured lines of credit.
    Based on borrowing rates available to the Company at
    December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of the mortgage
    loans payable and lines of credit was $215.0 million.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In December
    2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141(R),

Business
    Combinations

, which changes the accounting for business
    combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued
    in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of
    contingent consideration, the accounting for preacquisition gain
    and loss contingencies, the accounting for acquisition-related
    restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of
    acquisition-related transaction costs and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company
    is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R) will have on its financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows, but, at a minimum, it will
    require the expensing of transaction costs.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51

,
    which clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary
    is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should
    be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.
    This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company
    is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 will have on its financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement No.

, which requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures
    about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under Statement No. 133 and
    its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
    SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
    The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 161.

INCOME
    AND FLAT TAXES

As a U.S. limited liability company, the allocated share of
    income or loss of the Company is included in the income tax
    returns of the individual equity interest owners. The
    Company’s Mexican subsidiaries are subject to Mexican
    statutory income and flat tax laws.

As of January 1, 2008, the business flat tax (IETU)
    replaced the asset tax and functions as an alternative minimum
    corporation tax.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had prepaid taxes to
    the Government of Mexico in the amount of $1.7 million,
    which is offset against current taxes payable in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The Company’s current income tax provision was computed
    based on the Mexican statutory rate of 28.0 percent. The
    flat tax provision was computed at the Mexican statutory rate of
    16.5 percent.

For tax purposes, as of December 31, 2008, the Company has
    Mexican net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
    $59.9 million, which will be available to offset future
    taxable income. If not used, these carry-forwards will expire
    between 2012 and 2018.

The Company’s deferred tax assets primarily relate to the
    value of tax net operating losses. The Company’s deferred
    tax liabilities relate to the differences between the basis for
    financial reporting purposes and tax reporting purposes. As of
    December 31, 2008, management believes that it is more
    likely than not that any deferred tax asset that exceeds the
    deferred tax liability will not be realized and therefore is
    offset with a valuation allowance. This analysis is completed
    for each Mexican subsidiary.

8.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTIES

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company records
    management/consulting fees to AMB and AMB Mexico at a rate of
    7.35 percent and 0.15 percent, respectively, of the
    net operating income of each SRL. The management/consulting fees
    are payable on a quarterly basis. Management/consulting fees are
    included in general and administrative expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The Company
    recorded management/consulting fees to AMB and AMB Mexico of
    $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

In addition, the Agreement states that AMB and AMB Mexico will
    receive in aggregate acquisition fees equal to 0.9 percent
    of the acquisition cost of any assets purchased by the Company
    other than assets purchased from an AMB-affiliated entity. The
    Company no paid acquisition fees to AMB for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The Company paid no acquisition fees to
    AMB Mexico for the year ended December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had unsecured minority
    interest shareholder loan obligations to AMB Mexico totaling
    $1.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, these loans had
    a weighted average rate of 16.51 percent, with maturity
    dates ranging from December 31, 2012 and June 30,
    2018. These minority interest shareholder loans are included in
    minority interests in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheet. Interest expense related to these minority interest
    shareholder loans is payable on a quarterly basis and is
    included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operation. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, the Company recorded interest expense from unsecured
    minority interest shareholder loans of $0.3 million.

AMB will be entitled to receive a promote distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR, reflecting the
    hypothetical dissolution of the Company at December 31,
    2011, or actual dissolution of the Company. As of
    December 31, 2008, no promote distribution had been earned
    by AMB.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had obligations to AMB
    of $2.8 million, primarily related to the unpaid portion of
    the purchase price of the properties acquired at the Date of
    Inception.

The SRLs are charged property management fees from AMB Mexico.
    The property management fees are calculated at a rate of
    3.0 percent of net rental income as defined in the various
    SRL project agreements. Property management fees are included as
    part of property operating costs in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of operations. The Company incurred
    property management fees to AMB Mexico of $1.0 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008.

AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include
    liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, accrued but
    unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to approximately $0.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008.

9.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Company may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a
    material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters.

The Company follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Company is not aware of
    any environmental liability with respect to the SRLs that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business
    assets or results of operations. However, there can be no
    assurance that such a material environmental liability does not
    exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Company carries
    liability, flood, environmental, terrorism and property and
    rental loss insurance. The Company believes that the policy
    terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and
    appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk of
    loss and the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Company’s properties are located
    in areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Company has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of wars that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although, the Company
    has obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits, that the Company believes are
    commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the Company will
    be able to collect under such policies. If an uninsured loss
    occurs, the Company could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006

(Report not required)

1.

ORGANIZATION

On December 31, 2004 (“Date of Inception”), AMB
    Property, L.P. (“AMB”) and Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte
    Ltd (“GIC”), formed AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, a Delaware
    limited liability company (the “Company”), for the
    purpose of investing in industrial properties in Mexico.

At the Date of Inception, AMB and GIC made cash equity
    contributions, net of transaction costs, of $1.5 million
    and $6.2 million, respectively, and acquired three
    properties comprised of eight buildings totaling
    1.3 million square feet (unaudited).

Pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the
    “Agreement”), AMB and GIC have investment capital
    commitments to the Company of $50.0 million and
    $200.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007,
    the remaining investment capital commitments from AMB and GIC
    were $31.0 million and $123.9 million, respectively.

AMB is the general manager of the Company with a
    19.19 percent managing member and limited member interest.
    GIC is an 80.81 percent limited member. According to the
    Agreement, the term of the Company will continue until
    December 31, 2011, unless extended or terminated sooner as
    provided for in the Agreement. AMB provides asset and portfolio
    management services for the Company’s real estate
    investments.

The Company owns 99.0 percent of the membership interests
    in the following Delaware limited liability corporations: AMB
    Mexico, L.L.C., AMB Chapala, LLC, AMB GDL 1, LLC, AMB
    Ferrocarril, LLC, AMB Corregidora, LLC, AMB Frontera, LLC, AMB
    Arbolada, LLC and AMB Los Altos 1, LLC (the
    “U.S. LLCs”). In connection with the
    Company’s holdings in AMB Ferrocarril, LLC and in
    accordance with the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability
    Company Agreement, AMB will be treated as if it had contributed
    a 99.0 percent membership interest in the U.S. LLCs in
    exchange for the real estate assets held by the Mexican limited
    liability entities covered under the Agreement. The
    U.S. LLCs in turn hold a 98.0 percent equity interest
    in the following Mexican limited liability entities (the
    “SRLs”): AMB Acción San Martín
    Obispo I, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB- Acción Centro
    Logístico Parque 1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción GDL
    1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción San Martin Obispo
    II, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Corregidora Distribution
    Center, S. de R.L. de C.V. , AMB-Acción Apodaca
    Distribution Center 2, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción
    Arbolada Distribution Center, S. de R.L. de C.V., and
    AMB-Acción Los Altos Industrial Park 1, S. de R.L. de C.V.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company owned 23 industrial
    buildings (the “Properties”), 12 in Guadalajara, 9 in
    Mexico City, 1 in Queretaro and 1 in Tijuana, totaling
    approximately 4.9 million square feet (unaudited).

2.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of the Company and the Company’s
    controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany amounts
    have been eliminated in consolidation. Non-controlling
    membership interests are reported as minority interests.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and
    Transactions.

The U.S. dollar is the
    functional currency for the Company’s Mexican operations as
    it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which
    the Company

S-135


AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Mexican
    pesos are remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance
    sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are reported at
    historical U.S. dollar balances. Income and expenses
    denominated in Mexican pesos are remeasured in a manner that
    approximates the weighted average exchange rates for the
    quarter. Foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains
    and losses are included in other income in the consolidated
    statements of operations. During the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company reported foreign
    currency remeasurement and transaction losses of approximately
    $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value less selling
    costs. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are
    reviewed for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economic and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of the Company’s long-lived assets could occur in the
    future period in which assumptions change. To the extent that a
    property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the
    property over its estimated fair value is charged to income and
    is included on the consolidated statements of operations. The
    management of the Company believes that there were no
    impairments of the carrying value of its investments in real
    estate as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or improvements
    that extend the economic useful life of assets are capitalized.

The Company records at acquisition an intangible asset for the
    value attributable to in-place leases and lease origination
    costs. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has recorded
    intangible assets in the amounts of $6.2 million and
    $3.5 million, for the value attributable to in-place leases
    and lease origination costs, respectively, which are included in
    buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    term of the related loan. As of both December 31, 2007 and
    2006, deferred financing costs were $1.8 million, net of
    accumulated amortization.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent interests held by AMB and G. Acción, S.A. de C.V.
    (“G. Acción”), a 38.9 percent owned
    entity of AMB, in various Company entities. Such investments are
    consolidated because the Company owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Members’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Company are allocated to each of the members in accordance
    with the Agreement. Distributions are made to each of the
    members in accordance with the Agreement.

Rental Revenues.

The Company, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period in which the applicable
    expenses are incurred. In addition, the Company nets its bad
    debt expense against rental income for financial reporting
    purposes. No bad debt expense was recorded for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Income Taxes.

No provision for
    U.S. federal income taxes has been recorded on the books of
    the Company, since the members’ respective shares of
    taxable income are reportable by the members on their respective
    tax returns. The Company accounts for Mexican income taxes for
    its Mexican subsidiaries using the asset and liability method.
    Under this method, income and asset taxes are provided for
    amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred as tax assets
    and liabilities based on differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets
    and liabilities and the value of net operating loss
    carry-forward balances. Deferred income taxes are measured using
    the statutory tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when
    the temporary differences will reverse

and/or

the
    net operating loss carry-forward balances will be utilized. A
    valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to
    amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Company in
    its trade areas. The existence of competing properties could
    have a material impact on the Company’s ability to lease
    space and on the level of rent that can be received. The Company
    has two tenants that accounted for 12.8 percent and
    10.2 percent, respectively, of rental revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Company’s financial instruments include mortgage loans
    payable and unsecured lines of credit. Based on borrowing rates
    available to the Company at December 31, 2007, the
    estimated fair value of the mortgage loans payable and lines of
    credit was $177.3 million. Management of the Company
    believes that the book value of its other financial instruments
    approximates fair value as of December 31, 2007.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In July 2006,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), which
    clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
    positions, as defined. FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity
    in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition
    and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. Adoption
    of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not have a material effect
    on the Company.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on its
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

, which permits entities to choose to measure
    many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
    that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. This Statement is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal year beginning after
    November 15, 2007. The Company does not believe that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact
    on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

INCOME
    AND ASSET TAXES

As a U.S. limited liability company, the allocated share of
    income or loss of the Company is included in the income tax
    returns of the individual equity interest owners. The
    Company’s Mexican subsidiaries are subject to Mexican
    statutory income and asset tax laws.

During the third quarter 2007, new legislation was passed and
    effective January 1, 2008, the business flat tax (IETU)
    will replace the existing asset tax and function as an
    alternative minimum corporation tax.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company prepaid to
    the Government of Mexico $2.0 million and
    $0.2 million, respectively, which is offset against current
    taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The Company’s income tax provision was computed based on
    the 2007 Mexican statutory rate of 28.0 percent.

Mexican income and asset tax expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:



(Dollars in thousands)

Current income and asset tax (expense) benefit

Deferred income tax (expense) benefit

Total (expense) benefit for income taxes

$

(2,729

$


For tax purposes, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company has Mexican net operating loss carry-forwards of
    approximately $26.9 million and $5.2 million,
    respectively, which will be available to offset future taxable
    income. If not used, these carry-forwards will expire between
    2012 and 2017.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
    used for income tax purposes. The Company’s deferred tax
    assets primarily relate to the value of tax net operating losses.

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating
    sufficient taxable income matching the reversal of prior
    years’ net operating losses giving rise to deferred tax
    assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2007, management
    believes that it is more likely than not that 100 percent
    of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTIES

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company records
    management/consulting fees to AMB and G. Acción at a rate
    of 7.35 percent and 0.15 percent, respectively, of the
    net operating income of each SRL. The management/consulting fees
    are payable on a quarterly basis. Management/consulting fees are
    included in general and administrative expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company
    recorded management/consulting fees to AMB and G. Acción of
    $1.5 million and $0.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In addition, the Agreement states that AMB and G. Acción
    will receive in aggregate acquisition fees equal to
    0.9 percent of the acquisition cost of any assets purchased
    by the Company other than assets purchased from an
    AMB-affiliated entity. The Company paid acquisition fees to AMB
    of $0.1 million and $0 for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company paid
    acquisition fees to G. Acción of $0.5 million and $0
    for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had unsecured
    minority interest shareholder loan obligations to G. Acción
    totaling $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
    These minority interest shareholder loans are included in
    minority interests in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets. Interest expense related to

these minority interest shareholder loans is paid on a quarterly
    basis and is included in interest expense in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded interest
    expense from secured and unsecured minority interest shareholder
    loans of $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

AMB will be entitled to receive a promote distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR, reflecting the
    hypothetical dissolution of the Company at December 31,
    2011, or actual dissolution of the Company. As of
    December 31, 2007, no promote distribution had been earned
    by AMB.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
    obligations to AMB and G. Acción of $2.8 million and
    $2.9 million, respectively, primarily related to the unpaid
    portion of the purchase price of the properties acquired at the
    Date of Inception.

The SRLs are charged property management fees from G.
    Acción. The property management fees are calculated at a
    rate of 3.0 percent of net rental income as defined in the
    Project Agreements. Property management fees are included as
    part of property operating costs in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations. The Company incurred
    property management fees to G. Acción of $0.7 million
    and $0.3 million for years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Unknown liabilities may include liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, accrued but
    unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to approximately $0.3 million and
    $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Company may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a
    material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters.

The Company follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Company is not aware of
    any environmental liability with respect to the SRLs that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business
    assets or results of operations. However, there can be no
    assurance that such a material environmental liability does not
    exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Company carries
    liability, flood, environmental, terrorism and property and
    rental loss insurance. The Company believes that the policy
    terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are

S-141


AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

adequate and appropriate under the circumstances, given the
    relative risk of loss and the cost of such coverage and industry
    practice. In addition, certain of the Company’s properties
    are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity;
    therefore, the Company has obtained limited earthquake insurance
    on those properties. There are, however, certain types of
    extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of wars that may
    be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although,
    the Company has obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism,
    with policy specifications and insured limits, that the Company
    believes are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the
    Company will be able to collect under such policies. If an
    uninsured loss occurs, the Company could lose its investment in
    and anticipated profits and cash flows from a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Company.
