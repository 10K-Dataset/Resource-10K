EXPLANATORY
    NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 of AMB Property
    Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or
    the context otherwise requires: references to “AMB Property
    Corporation”, the “Parent Company” or the
    “parent company” mean AMB Property Corporation, a
    Maryland corporation, and its controlled subsidiaries; and
    references to “AMB Property, L.P.”, the
    “Operating Partnership” or the “operating
    partnership” mean AMB Property, L.P., a Delaware limited
    partnership, and its controlled subsidiaries. The terms
    “the Company” and “the company” mean the
    parent company, the operating partnership and their controlled
    subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In addition, references to
    the company, the parent company or the operating partnership
    could mean the entity itself or one or a number of their
    controlled subsidiaries.

The parent company is a real estate investment trust and the
    general partner of the operating partnership. As of
    December 31, 2009, the parent company owned an approximate
    97.8% general partnership interest in the operating partnership,
    excluding preferred units. The remaining approximate 2.2% common
    limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated
    investors and certain current and former directors and officers
    of the parent company. As of December 31, 2009, the parent
    company owned all of the preferred limited partnership units of
    the operating partnership. As the sole general partner of the
    operating partnership, the parent company has the full,
    exclusive and complete responsibility for the operating
    partnership’s

day-to-day

management and control.

The company believes combining the annual reports on

Form 10-K

of the parent company and the operating partnership into this
    single report results in the following benefits:

•

enhancing investors’ understanding of the parent company
    and the operating partnership by enabling investors to view the
    business as a whole in the same manner as management views and
    operates the business;

•

eliminating duplicative disclosure and providing a more
    streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial
    portion of the company’s disclosure applies to both the
    parent company and the operating partnership; and

•

creating time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of
    one combined report instead of two separate reports.

Management operates the parent company and the operating
    partnership as one enterprise. The management of the parent
    company consists of the same members as the management of the
    operating partnership. These members are officers of the parent
    company and employees of the operating partnership.

There are few differences between the parent company and the
    operating partnership, which are reflected in the disclosure in
    this report. The company believes it is important to understand
    the differences between the parent company and the operating
    partnership in the context of how the parent company and the
    operating partnership operate as an interrelated consolidated
    company. The parent company is a real estate investment trust,
    whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership
    interests of the operating partnership. As a result, the parent
    company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as
    the sole general partner of the operating partnership, issuing
    public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of
    the operating partnership. The parent company itself does not
    hold any indebtedness but guarantees some of the secured and
    unsecured debt of the operating partnership, as disclosed in
    this report. The operating partnership holds substantially all
    the assets of the company and holds the ownership interests in
    the company’s joint ventures. The operating partnership
    conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a
    partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net
    proceeds from public equity issuances by the parent company,
    which are contributed to the operating partnership in exchange
    for partnership units, the operating partnership generates the
    capital required by the company’s business through the
    operating partnership’s operations, by the operating
    partnership’s direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness
    or through the issuance of partnership units of the operating
    partnership or its subsidiaries.

Noncontrolling interests and stockholder’s equity and
    partners’ capital are the main areas of difference between
    the consolidated financial statements of the parent company and
    those of the operating partnership. The common limited
    partnership interests in the operating partnership are accounted
    for as partners’ capital in the



operating partnership’s financial statements and as
    noncontrolling interests in the parent company’s financial
    statements. The noncontrolling interests in the operating
    partnership’s financial statements include the interests of
    joint venture partners, and preferred limited partnership
    unitholders and common limited partnership unitholders of AMB
    Property II, L.P., a subsidiary of the operating partnership.
    The noncontrolling interests in the parent company’s
    financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests
    at the operating partnership level and limited partnership
    unitholders of the operating partnership. The differences
    between stockholders’ equity and partners’ capital
    result from the differences in the equity issued at the parent
    company and operating partnership levels.

To help investors understand the significant differences between
    the parent company and the operating partnership, this report
    presents the following separate sections for each of the parent
    company and the operating partnership:

•

consolidated financial statements;

•

the following notes to the consolidated financial statements:

•

Debt;

•

Income taxes;

•

Noncontrolling Interests; and

•

Stockholders’ Equity of the Parent Company/Partners’
    Capital of the Operating Partnership; and

•

Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

This report also includes separate Item 9A. Controls and
    Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32
    certifications for each of the parent company and the operating
    partnership in order to establish that the Chief Executive
    Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each entity have made
    the requisite certifications and that the parent company and
    operating partnership are compliant with

Rule 13a-15

or

Rule 15d-15

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C.
    §1350.

In order to highlight the differences between the parent company
    and the operating partnership, the separate sections in this
    report for the parent company and the operating partnership
    specifically refer to the parent company and the operating
    partnership. In the sections that combine disclosure of the
    parent company and the operating partnership, this report refers
    to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the
    company. Although the operating partnership is generally the
    entity that enters into contracts and joint ventures and holds
    assets and debt, reference to the company is appropriate because
    the business is one enterprise and the parent company operates
    the business through the operating partnership.

As general partner with control of the operating partnership,
    the parent company consolidates the operating partnership for
    financial reporting purposes, and the parent company does not
    have significant assets other than its investment in the
    operating partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of
    the parent company and the operating partnership are the same on
    their respective financial statements. The separate discussions
    of the parent company and the operating partnership in this
    report should be read in conjunction with each other to
    understand the results of the company on a consolidated basis
    and how management operates the company.

FORWARD-LOOKING
    STATEMENTS

Some of the information included in this annual report on

Form 10-K

contains forward-looking statements, which are made pursuant to
    the safe-harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Because these
    forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and
    uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause the
    company’s actual results to differ materially from those in
    the forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the
    forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The
    events or circumstances reflected in the forward-looking
    statements might not occur. You can identify forward-looking
    statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as
    “believes,” “expects,” “may,”
    “will,” “should,” “seeks,”
    “approximately,” “intends,”
    “plans,” “forecasting,”
    “pro forma,” “estimates” or
    “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and
    phrases, or similar words or phrases. You can also identify
    forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or
    intentions. Forward-looking statements should not be read as
    guarantees of future performance or results, and will not
    necessarily be accurate indicators of whether, or the time at
    which, such performance or results will be achieved. There is no
    assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in
    forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved.
    Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on
    assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise
    and the company may not be able to realize them.

The following factors, among others, apply to the
    company’s business as a whole and could cause its actual
    results and future events to differ materially from those set
    forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:

•

changes in general economic conditions in California, the
    U.S. or globally (including financial market fluctuations),
    global trade or in the real estate sector (including risks
    relating to decreasing real estate valuations and impairment
    charges);

•

risks associated with using debt to fund the company’s
    business activities, including re-financing and interest rate
    risks;

•

the company’s failure to obtain, renew, or extend
    necessary financing or access the debt or equity markets;

•

the company’s failure to maintain its current credit
    agency ratings or comply with its debt covenants;

•

risks related to the company’s obligations in the event
    of certain defaults under co-investment venture and other
    debt;

•

risks associated with equity and debt securities financings
    and issuances (including the risk of dilution);

•

defaults on or non-renewal of leases by customers or renewal
    at lower than expected rent;

•

difficulties in identifying properties, portfolios of
    properties, or interests in real-estate related entities or
    platforms to acquire and in effecting acquisitions on
    advantageous terms and the failure of acquisitions to perform as
    the company expects;

•

unknown liabilities acquired in connection with acquired
    properties, portfolios of properties, or interests in
    real-estate related entities;

•

the company’s failure to successfully integrate acquired
    properties and operations;

•

risks and uncertainties affecting property development,
    redevelopment and value-added conversion (including construction
    delays, cost overruns, the company’s inability to obtain
    necessary permits and financing, the company’s inability to
    lease properties at all or at favorable rents and terms, and
    public opposition to these activities);

•

the company’s failure to set up additional funds,
    attract additional investment in existing funds or to contribute
    properties to its co-investment ventures due to such factors as
    its inability to acquire, develop, or lease properties that meet
    the investment criteria of such ventures, or the co-investment
    ventures’ inability to access debt and equity capital to
    pay for property contributions or their allocation of available
    capital to cover other capital requirements;

•

risks and uncertainties relating to the disposition of
    properties to third parties and the company’s ability to
    effect such transactions on advantageous terms and to timely
    reinvest proceeds from any such dispositions;



•

risks of doing business internationally and global expansion,
    including unfamiliarity with new markets and currency risks;

•

risks of changing personnel and roles;

•

losses in excess of the company’s insurance coverage;

•

changes in local, state and federal regulatory requirements,
    including changes in real estate and zoning laws;

•

increases in real property tax rates;

•

risks associated with the company’s tax structuring;

•

increases in interest rates and operating costs or greater
    than expected capital expenditures; and

•

environmental uncertainties and risks related to natural
    disasters.

In addition, if the parent company fails to qualify and
    maintain its status as a real estate investment trust under the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, then the parent
    company’s actual results and future events could differ
    materially from those set forth or contemplated in the
    forward-looking statements.

The company’s success also depends upon economic trends
    generally, various market conditions and fluctuations and those
    other risk factors discussed under the heading “Risk
    Factors” in Item 1A of this report. The company
    cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking
    statements, which reflect the company’s analysis only and
    speak as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated
    in the statements. All of the company’s forward-looking
    statements, including those in this report, are qualified in
    their entirety by this statement. The company assumes no
    obligation to update or supplement forward-looking
    statements.

The company uses the terms “industrial properties” or
    “industrial buildings” to describe the various types
    of industrial properties in its portfolio and uses these terms
    interchangeably with the following: logistics facilities,
    centers or warehouses, High Throughput
    Distribution

®

(HTD

®

)

    facilities; or any combination of these terms. The company uses
    the term “owned and managed” to describe assets in
    which it has at least a 10% ownership interest, for which it is
    the property or asset manager and which it currently intends to
    hold for the long term. The company uses the term “joint
    venture” to describe all joint ventures, including
    co-investment ventures with real estate developers, other real
    estate operators, or institutional investors where the company
    may or may not have control, act as the manager

and/or

developer, earn asset management distributions or fees, or earn
    incentive distributions or promote interests. In certain cases,
    the company might provide development, leasing, property
    management

and/or

accounting services, for which it may receive compensation. The
    company uses the term “co-investment venture” to
    describe joint ventures with institutional investors, managed by
    the company, from which the company typically receives
    acquisition fees for acquisitions, portfolio and asset
    management distributions or fees, as well as incentive
    distributions or promote interests. Unless otherwise indicated,
    management’s discussion and analysis applies to both the
    operating partnership and the parent company.

PART I

Item 1.

Business

The
    Company

The company is a global owner, operator and developer of
    industrial real estate, focused on major hub and gateway
    distribution markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. As of
    December 31, 2009, the company owned, or had investments
    in, on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint
    ventures, properties and development projects expected to total
    approximately 155.1 million square feet (14.4 million
    square meters) in 47 markets within 14 countries. The company
    invests in properties located predominantly in the infill
    submarkets of its targeted markets. The company’s portfolio
    is comprised of High Throughput
    Distribution

®

facilities — industrial properties built for speed and
    located near airports, seaports and ground transportation
    systems.

The approximately 155.1 million square feet as of
    December 31, 2009 included:

•

132.6 million square feet (principally, warehouse
    distribution buildings) on an owned and managed basis, which
    includes investments held on a consolidated basis or through
    unconsolidated joint ventures, that were 91.2% leased;

•

15.0 million square feet in its development portfolio,
    including approximately 9.7 million square feet in 33
    development projects that are complete and in the process of
    stabilization and approximately 5.3 million square feet in
    15 development projects under construction;

•

7.4 million square feet in 46 industrial operating
    buildings in unconsolidated joint ventures in which the company
    has investments but does not manage; and

•

152,000 square feet through a ground lease, which is the
    location of its global headquarters.

The company’s business is operated primarily through the
    operating partnership. As of December 31, 2009, the parent
    company owned an approximate 97.8% general partnership interest
    in the operating partnership, excluding preferred units. As the
    sole general partner of the operating partnership, the parent
    company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for
    and discretion in its

day-to-day

management and control.

The parent company is a self-administered and self-managed real
    estate investment trust and it expects that it has qualified,
    and will continue to qualify, as a real estate investment trust
    for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended
    December 31, 1997. As a self-administered and self-managed
    real estate investment trust, the company’s own employees
    perform its corporate administrative and management functions,
    rather than the company relying on an outside manager for these
    services. The company believes that real estate is fundamentally
    a local business and is best operated by local teams in each of
    its markets. As a vertically integrated company, the company
    actively manages its portfolio of properties. In select markets,
    the company may, from time to time, establish relationships with
    third-party real estate management firms, brokers and developers
    that provide some property-level administrative and management
    services under the company’s direction.

The company’s global headquarters are located at Pier 1,
    Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111; the company’s
    telephone number is

(415) 394-9000.

The company’s other principal office locations are in
    Amsterdam, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Shanghai,
    Singapore and Tokyo. As of December 31, 2009, the company
    employed 521 individuals.

Investment
    Strategy

The company’s investment strategy focuses on providing
    distribution space to customers whose businesses are tied to
    global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods
    through the global supply chain. The company’s properties
    are primarily located in the world’s busiest distribution
    markets featuring large, supply-constrained infill locations
    with dense populations and proximity to seaports, airports and
    major freeway interchanges. When measured by annualized base
    rent, on an owned and managed basis, a substantial majority of
    the company’s portfolio of industrial properties is located
    in its target markets and much of this is in infill submarkets.
    Infill locations are characterized by supply constraints on the
    availability of land for competing projects as well as



physical, political or economic barriers to new development. The
    company believes that its facilities are essential to creating
    efficiencies in the supply chain and its business encompasses a
    blend of real estate, global logistics and infrastructure.

In its target markets, the company focuses on
    HTD

®

facilities, industrial properties designed to facilitate the
    rapid distribution of its customers’ products rather than
    the long term storage of goods. The company’s investment
    focus on
    HTD

®

assets is based on what it believes to be a global trend toward
    lower inventory levels and expedited supply chains.
    HTD

®

facilities generally have a variety of physical and locational
    characteristics that allow for the rapid transport of goods from
    point to point. These physical characteristics could include
    numerous dock doors, shallower building depths, fewer columns,
    large truck courts and more space for trailer parking. The
    company believes that these building characteristics help its
    customers to reduce their costs and become more efficient in
    their delivery systems. The locational characteristics feature
    large, supply-constrained infill locations with dense
    populations and proximity to seaports, airports and major
    freeway interchanges. The company’s customers comprise
    logistics, freight forwarding and air-express companies with
    time-sensitive needs that value facilities that are proximate to
    transportation infrastructure.

The company believes that changes in global trade have been a
    primary driver of demand for industrial real estate for decades,
    as the correlation between industrial demand and
    U.S. imports and exports is approximately 80%. The company
    has observed that demand for industrial real estate is further
    influenced by the long-term relationship between trade and GDP.
    Trade and GDP are closely interrelated as higher levels of
    investment, production and consumption within a globalized
    country are consistent with increased levels of imports and
    exports. As the world produces and consumes more, the company
    believes that the volume of global trade will continue to
    increase at a rate well in excess of global GDP. International
    Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts indicated that global trade fell
    by more than 12% in 2009, the steepest decline in modern
    history. This compares to a forecasted decline of only 1% in
    global GDP. Current 2010 consensus estimates for the
    U.S. and global GDP growth are 2.7% and 3.9%, respectively,
    which the company believes should result in a significant
    rebound in trade and industrial real estate demand.

Primary
    Sources of Revenue and Earnings

The primary source of the company’s core earnings is
    revenues received from its real estate operations and private
    capital business. The principal contributor of its core earnings
    is rent received from customers under long-term (generally three
    to ten years) operating leases at its properties, including
    reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs and
    asset management fees. The company also generates core earnings
    from its private capital business, which include priority
    distributions, acquisition and development fees, promote
    interests and incentive distributions from its co-investment
    ventures. The company may generate additional earnings from the
    disposition of assets in its

development-for-sale

and value-added conversion programs as well as from land sales.

Long-Term
    Growth Strategies

The company believes that its long-term growth will be driven by
    its ability to:

•

maintain and increase occupancy rates

and/or

increase rental rates at its properties;

•

raise third-party equity and grow its earnings from its private
    capital business from the acquisition of new properties or
    through the possible contribution of properties;

•

acquire industrial real estate with total returns above the
    company’s cost of capital; and

•

develop properties profitably and either to hold or to sell
    these development properties to third parties.

Growth
    through Operations

The company seeks to generate long-term internal growth by
    maintaining a high occupancy rate at its properties, by
    controlling expenses and through contractual rent increases on
    existing space and thus capitalizing on the economies of scale
    inherent in owning, operating and growing a large, global
    portfolio. The company actively manages its portfolio by
    establishing leasing strategies and negotiating lease terms,
    pricing, and level and timing of property improvements. With
    respect to its leasing strategies, the company takes a long-term
    view to ensure that it



maximizes the value of its real estate. As the company continues
    to work through a challenging operating environment and to
    provide flexibility to its customers, the company evaluates and
    adjusts its leasing strategies for market terms and leasing
    rates, which may include leasing terms of less than four years
    in duration. The company believes that its long-standing focus
    on customer relationships and ability to provide global
    solutions for a well-diversified customer base in the logistics,
    shipping, and air cargo industries will enable it to capitalize
    on opportunities as they arise.

The company believes that the strategic locations within its
    portfolio, the experience of its cycle-tested operations team
    and its ability to respond quickly to the needs of its customers
    provides a competitive advantage in leasing. The company
    believes that its regular maintenance programs, capital
    expenditure programs, energy management and sustainability
    programs create cost efficiencies that provide benefit to it and
    its customers.

Growth
    through Co-Investments

The company, through AMB Capital Partners, LLC, its private
    capital group, was one of the pioneers of the real estate
    investment trust (REIT) industry’s co-investment model and
    has more than 26 years of experience in asset management
    and fund formation. The company co-invests in properties with
    private capital investors through partnerships, limited
    liability companies or other joint ventures. The company has a
    direct and long-standing relationship with institutional
    investors. More than 60% of the company’s owned and managed
    operating portfolio is held through its eight co-investment
    ventures. The company tailors industrial portfolios to
    investors’ specific needs in separate or commingled
    accounts and deploys capital in both close-ended and open-ended
    structures, while providing complete portfolio management and
    financial reporting services. Generally, the company is the
    largest investor in its funds and owns a

10-50%

interest in its co-investment ventures. The company believes
    that its significant ownership of

10-50%

in
    each of its funds provides a strong alignment of its interest
    with its co-investment partners’ interests.

The company believes that its co-investment program with
    private-capital investors will continue to serve as a source of
    revenues and capital for new investments. In anticipation of the
    formation of future co-investment ventures, the company may also
    hold acquired and newly developed properties for contribution to
    such future co-investment ventures. The company may make
    additional investments through its existing co-investment
    ventures or new co-investment ventures in the future and
    presently plans to do so. The company is in various stages of
    discussions with prospective investors to attract new capital to
    take advantage of potential future opportunities and these
    capital raising activities may include the formation of new
    joint ventures. Such transactions, if the company completes
    them, may be material individually or in aggregate.

Growth
    through Acquisitions and Capital Redeployment

The company’s acquisition experience and its network of
    property management, leasing and acquisition resources should
    continue to provide opportunities for growth. In addition to its
    internal resources, the company has long-term relationships with
    lenders, leasing and investment sales brokers, as well as
    third-party local property management firms, which may give it
    access to additional acquisition opportunities because such
    managers frequently market properties on behalf of sellers. The
    company is actively monitoring its target markets and may seek
    opportunities to selectively acquire high-quality, well-located
    industrial real estate. The company strives to enhance the
    quality of its portfolio through acquisitions that are accretive
    to the company’s earnings and its net asset value. In
    addition, the company seeks to redeploy capital from the sale of
    non-strategic assets into properties that better fit its current
    investment focus.

The company is generally engaged in various stages of
    negotiations for a number of acquisitions and other
    transactions, some of which may be significant, that may
    include, but are not limited to, individual properties, large
    multi-property portfolios and platforms or property owning or
    real estate-related entities.

Growth
    through Development

The company’s development business consists of conventional
    development,

build-to-suit

development, redevelopment, value-added conversions and land
    sales. Despite the cyclical downturn in the U.S. and global
    economy, the company believes that, over the long term, customer
    demand for new industrial space in strategic



markets tied to global trade will continue to outpace supply,
    most notably in major gateway markets in Asia, Europe and
    Brazil. The company believes that the development, redevelopment
    and expansion of well-located, high-quality industrial
    properties provide attractive investment opportunities at higher
    rates of return, due to the development risk, than may be
    obtained from the purchase of existing properties. Through the
    deployment of its in-house development and redevelopment
    expertise, the company seeks to create value both through new
    construction and the acquisition and management of redevelopment
    opportunities. New developments, redevelopments and value-added
    conversions require significant management attention, and
    development and redevelopment may require significant capital
    investment, to maximize their returns. The company pursues
    development projects directly and in co-investment ventures and
    development joint ventures, providing it with the flexibility to
    pursue development projects independently or in partnerships,
    depending on market conditions, submarkets or building sites and
    availability of capital. Completed development and redevelopment
    properties are held in its owned and managed portfolio or sold
    to third parties.

The company believes that its long-standing focus on infill
    locations creates a unique opportunity to enhance value through
    the conversion of select industrial properties to higher and
    better uses. Value-added conversion projects generally involve a
    significant enhancement or a change in use of the property from
    an industrial facility to a higher and better use, including use
    as research & development, office, residential,
    retail, or manufacturing properties. Activities required to
    prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use
    may include rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and
    retenanting. The sales price of a value-added conversion project
    is generally based on the underlying land value, reflecting its
    ultimate higher and better use and, as such, little to no
    residual value is ascribed to the industrial building.
    Generally, the company expects to sell to third parties these
    value-added conversion projects at some point in the
    re-entitlement and conversion process, thus recognizing the
    enhanced value of the underlying land that supports the
    property’s repurposed use. The company believes that its
    global market presence and expertise will enable it to generate
    and capitalize on a diverse range of development opportunities
    over the long term.

The company’s development team has experience in real
    estate development, both with the company and with local,
    national or international development firms. Although the
    company has reduced its development staff in correlation to
    reduced levels of development activity, the company has retained
    certain key investment and development personnel in its most
    productive platforms around the globe to preserve its long-term
    growth potential. This core development team possesses
    multidisciplinary backgrounds that allows for the completion of
    the build-out of the company’s development pipeline, as
    well as the temporary deployment of some of the team members in
    leasing, operations and customer service, as it completes the
    build-out and

lease-up

of
    its current development pipeline.

    Consolidated Financial Statements” for segment information

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

BUSINESS
    RISKS

The company’s operations involve various risks that could
    have adverse consequences to it. These risks include, among
    others:

Risks of
    the Current Economic Environment

Disruptions
    in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect
    the company’s business, results of operations, cash flows
    and financial condition.

Recent global market and economic conditions have been
    unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions,
    slower growth and recession in most major economies during 2009.
    Although signs of recovery may exist, there are continued
    concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, the
    availability and cost of credit, a declining real estate market,
    and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market
    volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy.
    These conditions, combined with declining business activity
    levels and consumer confidence, increased unemployment and
    volatile oil prices, contributed to unprecedented levels of
    volatility in the capital markets during 2009. Any additional,
    continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit
    markets may adversely affect the company’s business,
    results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

As a result of these market conditions, the cost and
    availability of credit have been and may continue to be
    adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit
    spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally
    and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many
    lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some
    cases, cease to provide funding to businesses and consumers.
    These factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses
    and consumers alike, and a corresponding decrease in global
    infrastructure spending. While the company currently believes
    that it has sufficient working capital and capacity under its
    credit facilities in the near term, continued or recurring
    turbulence in the global markets and economies and prolonged
    declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect
    its liquidity and financial condition, as well as the liquidity
    and financial condition of its customers. If these market
    conditions persist, recur or worsen in the long term, they may
    limit the company’s ability, and the ability of its
    customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities, and access
    the credit markets to meet liquidity needs.

If the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall
    below its current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under its
    unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans may increase.
    In addition, if the long-term debt ratings of the operating
    partnership fall below investment grade, it may be unable to
    request borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or
    Japanese Yen, as applicable; however, the lack of other currency
    borrowings does not affect its ability to fully draw down under
    the credit facilities or term loans. While the operating
    partnership currently does not expect its long-term debt ratings
    to fall below investment grade, in the event that its ratings do
    fall below those levels, it may be unable to exercise its
    options to extend the term of its credit facilities, and the
    loss of its ability to borrow in foreign currencies could affect
    its ability to optimally hedge its borrowings against foreign
    currency exchange rate changes. In addition, the company cannot
    assure you that additional, continuing or recurring long-term
    disruptions in the global economy and the continuation of
    tighter credit conditions among, and potential failures of,
    third-party financial institutions as a result of such
    disruptions will not have an adverse effect on the operating
    partnership’s borrowing capacity and liquidity position.
    The operating partnership’s access to funds under its
    credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the lenders
    that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding
    commitments to the operating partnership. The company cannot
    assure you that if one of the operating partnership’s
    lenders fails (some of whom are lenders under a number of the
    operating partnership’s facilities), the operating
    partnership will be successful in finding a replacement lender
    and, as a result, its borrowing capacity under the applicable
    facilities may be permanently reduced. If the company does not
    have sufficient cash flows and income from its operations to
    meet its financial commitments and those lenders are not able to
    meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership, the
    company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and
    financial condition could be adversely affected.



Certain of the company’s third-party indebtedness is held
    by the company’s consolidated or unconsolidated joint
    ventures. In the event that the company’s joint venture
    partner is unable to meet its obligations under the joint
    venture agreements or the third-party debt agreements, the
    company may elect to pay its joint venture partner’s
    portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the mortgaged property
    or permit the lender to foreclose on the mortgaged property to
    meet the joint venture’s debt obligations. In either case,
    the company could face a loss of income and asset value on the
    property.

There can be no assurance that the markets will stabilize in the
    near future or that the company will choose to or be able to
    increase its levels of capital deployment at such time or ever.
    In addition, a continued increase in the cost of credit and
    inability to access the capital and credit markets may adversely
    impact the occupancy of the company’s properties, the
    disposition of its properties, private capital raising and
    contribution of properties to its co-investment ventures. For
    example, an inability to fully lease the company’s
    properties may result in such properties not meeting the
    company’s investment criteria for contributions to its
    co-investment ventures. If the company is unable to contribute
    completed development properties to its co-investment ventures
    or sell its completed development projects to third parties, the
    company will not be able to recognize gains from the
    contribution or sale of such properties and, as a result, the
    net income available to the parent company’s common
    stockholders and its funds from operations will decrease.
    Additionally, business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns
    and other similar factors that affect the company’s
    customers may adversely impact its business and financial
    condition. Furthermore, general uncertainty in the real estate
    markets has resulted in conditions where the pricing of certain
    real estate assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with
    respect to capitalization rates and valuations, among other
    things, which may add to the difficulty of buyers or the
    company’s co-investment ventures to obtain financing on
    favorable terms to acquire such properties or cause potential
    buyers to not complete acquisitions of such properties. The
    market uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and real
    estate valuations also adversely impacts the company’s net
    asset value. In addition, the operating partnership may face
    difficulty in refinancing its mortgage debt, or may be unable to
    refinance such debt at all, if its property values significantly
    decline. Such a decline may also cause a default under the

loan-to-value

covenants in some of the company’s joint ventures’
    mortgage debt, which may require its joint ventures to re-margin
    or pay down a portion of the applicable debt. There can be no
    assurance, however, that in such an event, the company will be
    able to do so to prevent foreclosure.

In the event that the company does not have sufficient cash
    available to it through its operations to continue operating its
    business as usual, the company may need to find alternative ways
    to increase its liquidity. Such alternatives may include,
    without limitation, divesting itself of properties, whether or
    not they otherwise meet the company’s strategic objectives
    to keep in the long term, at less than optimal terms; issuing
    and selling its debt and equity in public or private
    transactions under less than optimal conditions; entering into
    leases with its customers at lower rental rates or less than
    optimal terms; or entering into lease renewals with its existing
    customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover. There
    can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to
    increase the company’s liquidity will be available to the
    company. Additionally, taking such measures to increase the
    company’s liquidity may adversely affect its business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

As of December 31, 2009, the company had
    $187.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. The
    company’s available cash and cash equivalents are held in
    accounts managed by third-party financial institutions and
    consist of invested cash and cash in its operating accounts. The
    invested cash is invested in money market funds that invest
    solely in direct obligations of the government of the United
    States or in time deposits with certain financial institutions.
    To date, the company has experienced no loss or lack of access
    to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however, the company
    can provide no assurances that access to its invested cash and
    cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in
    the financial markets.

At any point in time, the company also has a significant amount
    of cash deposits in its operating accounts that are with
    third-party financial institutions, and, as of December 31,
    2009, the amount in such deposits was approximately
    $159.4 million on a consolidated basis. These balances
    exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance
    limits. While the company monitors daily the cash balances in
    its operating accounts and adjusts the cash balances as
    appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the
    underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other
    adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, the
    company has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its
    operating accounts.



The
    price per share of the parent company’s stock may decline
    or fluctuate significantly.

The market price per share of the parent company’s common
    stock may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many
    factors, including:

•

general market and economic conditions;

•

actual or anticipated variations in the parent company’s
    operating results or dividends or the parent company’s
    payment of dividends in shares of its stock;

•

changes in its funds from operations or earnings estimates;

•

difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or
    refinance existing debt;

•

breaches of covenants and defaults under the operating
    partnership’s credit facilities and other debt;

•

decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations, market
    rents and rental occupancy rates;

•

a change in analyst ratings or the operating partnership’s
    credit ratings;

•

general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in
    interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead
    prospective purchasers of the parent company’s stock to
    demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;

•

adverse market reaction to any additional debt the operating
    partnership incurs in the future or any other capital market
    activity the company may conduct, including additional issuances
    of parent company stock;

•

adverse market reaction to the company’s strategic
    initiatives and their implementation;

•

changes in market valuations of similar companies;

•

publication of research reports about the parent company or the
    real estate industry;

•

the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the
    attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other
    equity securities (including securities issued by other real
    estate-based companies);

•

additions or departures of key management personnel;

•

actions by institutional stockholders;

•

speculation in the press or investment community;

•

terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which the
    company’s securities trade, possibly increasing market
    volatility and causing the further erosion of business and
    consumer confidence and spending;

•

governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws; and

•

the realization of any of the other risk factors included in
    this report.

Many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s
    control. These factors may cause the market price of shares of
    the parent company’s common stock to decline, regardless of
    its financial condition, results of operations, business or its
    prospects.

Debt
    Financing Risks

The
    company faces risks associated with the use of debt to fund its
    business activities, including refinancing and interest rate
    risks.

As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had
    total debt outstanding of $3.2 billion. As of
    December 31, 2009, the parent company guaranteed
    $1.2 billion of the operating partnership’s
    obligations with respect to the senior debt securities
    referenced in the parent company’s financial statements.
    The operating partnership is subject to risks normally
    associated with debt financing, including the risk that its cash
    flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal
    and interest. It is likely that the operating partnership will
    need



to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as it
    matures. There is a risk that the operating partnership may not
    be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any
    refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of its
    existing debt. If the operating partnership is unable to
    refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay
    them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then the
    operating partnership expects that its cash flow will not be
    sufficient in all years to repay all such maturing debt and to
    pay distributions to its unitholders, including the parent
    company, which, in turn, will be unable to pay cash dividends to
    its stockholders. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or
    other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance
    of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in
    higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest
    expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.
    Higher interest rates on newly incurred debt may negatively
    impact the operating partnership as well. If interest rates
    increase, the operating partnership’s interest costs and
    overall costs of capital will increase, which could adversely
    affect its financial condition, results of operation and cash
    flow, the market price of the parent company’s stock, the
    operating partnership’s ability to pay principal and
    interest on its debt and to pay distributions to its
    unitholders, the parent company’s ability to pay cash
    dividends to its stockholders and the operating
    partnership’s capital deployment activity. In addition,
    there may be circumstances that will require the operating
    partnership to obtain amendments or waivers to provisions in its
    credit facilities or other financings. There can be no assurance
    that the operating partnership will be able to obtain necessary
    amendments or waivers at all or without significant expense. In
    such case, the operating partnership may not be able to fund its
    business activities as planned, within budget or at all.

In addition, if the company mortgages one or more of its
    properties to secure payment of indebtedness and the company is
    unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be
    foreclosed upon or transferred to the lender with a consequent
    loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of
    the company’s properties could adversely affect its
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay distributions to the operating partnership’s
    unitholders and cash dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders, and the market price of the parent company’s
    stock.

As of December 31, 2009, the company had outstanding bank
    guarantees in the amount of $0.4 million used to secure
    contingent obligations, primarily obligations under development
    and purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2009, the
    company also guaranteed $47.9 million and
    $106.7 million on outstanding loans for six of its
    consolidated co-investment ventures and four of its
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures, respectively. Also, the
    company has entered into contribution agreements with certain of
    its unconsolidated co-investment venture funds. These
    contribution agreements require the company to make additional
    capital contributions to the applicable co-investment venture
    fund upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of its
    debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital
    contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than the company’s share of the co-investment
    venture’s debt obligation or the value of the
    company’s share of any property securing such debt. The
    company’s contribution obligations under these agreements
    will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the
    fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the
    debt and obtained by the lender upon default. The company’s
    potential obligations under these contribution agreements were
    $260.6 million as of December 31, 2009. The company
    intends to continue to guarantee debt of its unconsolidated
    co-investment venture funds and make additional contributions to
    its unconsolidated co-investment venture funds in connection
    with property contributions to the funds. Such payment
    obligations under such guarantees and contribution obligations
    under such contribution agreements, if required to be paid,
    could be of a magnitude that could adversely affect the
    company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash
    flow and ability to pay cash dividends to the parent
    company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the
    parent company’s stock.

Adverse
    changes in the company’s credit ratings could negatively
    affect its financing activity.

The credit ratings of the operating partnership’s senior
    unsecured long-term debt and the parent company’s preferred
    stock are based on its operating performance, liquidity and
    leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors
    employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses
    of the company. The company’s credit ratings can affect the
    amount of capital it can access, as well as the terms and
    pricing of any debt the operating partnership may incur. There
    can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain
    its current credit ratings, and in the event its current credit
    ratings are downgraded, the company would likely incur higher
    borrowing costs



and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing.
    Also, a downgrade in the company’s credit ratings may
    trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under
    its current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.
    For example, if the operating partnership’s credit ratings
    of its senior unsecured long-term debt are downgraded to below
    investment grade levels, the operating partnership may not be
    able to obtain or maintain extensions on certain of its existing
    debt. Adverse changes in the operating partnership’s credit
    ratings could negatively impact its refinancing and other
    capital market activities, its ability to manage its debt
    maturities, its future growth, its financial condition, the
    market price of the parent company’s stock, and its
    development and acquisition activity.

Covenants
    in the operating partnership’s debt agreements could
    adversely affect its financial condition.

The terms of the operating partnership’s credit agreements
    and other indebtedness require that it complies with a number of
    financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service
    coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.
    These covenants may limit flexibility in the operating
    partnership’s operations, and its failure to comply with
    these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt
    agreement even if it has satisfied its payment obligations. As
    of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had certain
    non-recourse, secured loans, which are cross-collateralized by
    multiple properties. If the operating partnership defaults on
    any of these loans, it may then be required to repay such
    indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to
    avoid foreclosure on all the cross-collateralized properties
    within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on the operating
    partnership’s properties, or its inability to refinance its
    loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact its financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders or
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders,
    and the market price of the parent company’s stock. In
    addition, the operating partnership’s credit facilities and
    senior debt securities contain certain cross-default provisions,
    which are triggered in the event that its other material
    indebtedness is in default. These cross-default provisions may
    require the operating partnership to repay or restructure the
    credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to
    any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could
    adversely affect the operating partnership’s financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    distributions to its unitholders and the parent company’s
    ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market
    price of its stock.

Failure
    to hedge effectively against exchange and interest rates may
    adversely affect results of operations.

The company seeks to manage its exposure to exchange and
    interest rate volatility by using exchange and interest rate
    hedging arrangements, such as cap agreements and swap
    agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk
    that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations
    under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be
    effective in reducing the company’s exposure to exchange or
    interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such
    agreements are not legally enforceable. Hedging may reduce
    overall returns on the company’s investments. Failure to
    hedge effectively against exchange and interest rate changes may
    materially adversely affect the company’s results of
    operations.

The
    company is dependent on external sources of
    capital.

In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the
    parent company is required each year to distribute to its
    stockholders at least 90% of its real estate investment trust
    taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid
    deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and is subject
    to tax to the extent its income is not fully distributed. While
    historically the parent company has satisfied these distribution
    requirements by making cash distributions to its stockholders,
    the parent company may choose to satisfy these requirements by
    making distributions of cash or other property, including, in
    limited circumstances, its own stock. For distributions with
    respect to taxable years ending on or before December 31,
    2011, and in some cases declared as late as December 31,
    2012, recent Internal Revenue Service guidance allows the parent
    company to satisfy up to 90% of the distribution requirements
    discussed above through the distribution of shares of its stock,
    if certain conditions are met. Assuming the parent company
    continues to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash,
    the parent company and the operating partnership may not be able
    to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and
    development activities, from cash retained from operations and
    may have to rely on third-party sources of capital. Further, in



order to maintain the parent company’s real estate
    investment trust status and avoid the payment of federal income
    and excise taxes, the parent company, through the operating
    partnership, may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to
    meet the real estate investment trust distribution requirements
    even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable
    for these borrowings. These short-term borrowing needs could
    result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of
    cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or
    the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation
    of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. The
    company’s ability to access private debt and equity capital
    on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of
    factors, including general market conditions, the market’s
    perception of the company’s growth potential, its current
    and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the
    market price of its securities.

The
    operating partnership could incur more debt, increasing its debt
    service.

As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership’s
    share of total

debt-to-its

share of total market capitalization ratio was 46.5%. The
    operating partnership’s definition of “the operating
    partnership’s share of total market capitalization” is
    the operating partnership’s share of total debt plus
    preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See
    footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table contained in
    Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operation — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for
    the operating partnership’s definitions of “market
    equity” and “the operating partnership’s share of
    total debt.” As this ratio percentage increases directly
    with a decrease in the market price per share of the parent
    company’s capital stock, an unstable market environment
    will impact this ratio in a volatile manner. There can also be
    no assurance that the operating partnership would not become
    more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service
    that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution
    to its unitholders and, in turn, the cash available to
    distribute to the parent company’s stockholders.
    Furthermore, if the operating partnership becomes more highly
    leveraged, the operating partnership may not be in compliance
    with the debt covenants contained in the agreements governing
    its co-investment ventures, which could adversely impact its
    private capital business.

Other
    Real Estate Industry Risks

The
    company’s performance and value are subject to general
    economic conditions and risks associated with its real estate
    assets.

The investment returns available from equity investments in real
    estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital
    appreciation generated by the properties, as well as the
    expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If the
    company’s properties do not generate income sufficient to
    meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital
    expenditures, then the operating partnership’s ability to
    pay distributions to its unitholders (including the parent
    company) and, in turn, the parent company’s ability to pay
    cash dividends to its stockholders could be adversely affected.
    In addition, there are significant expenditures associated with
    an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real
    estate taxes and maintenance costs) that generally do not
    decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property.
    Income from, and the value of, the company’s properties may
    be adversely affected by:

•

changes in the general economic climate, such as the current
    one, including diminished access to or availability of capital
    (including difficulties in financing, refinancing and extending
    existing debt) and rising inflation (see “Risks of the
    Current Economic Environment”);

•

local conditions, such as oversupply of or a reduction in demand
    for industrial space;

•

the attractiveness of the company’s properties to potential
    customers;

•

competition from other properties;

•

the company’s ability to provide adequate maintenance and
    insurance;

•

increased operating costs;

•

increased cost of compliance with regulations;

•

the potential for liability under applicable laws (including
    changes in tax laws); and

•

disruptions in the global supply chain caused by political,
    regulatory or other factors, including terrorism.



In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession in the
    United States and in other countries, rising interest rates,
    diminished access to or availability of capital or declining
    demand for real estate, may result in a general decrease in
    rents, an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases
    or greater difficulty in financing the company’s
    acquisition and development activities, which would adversely
    affect the company’s financial condition and results of
    operations. Future terrorist attacks may result in declining
    economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and the
    value of the company’s properties. To the extent that
    future attacks impact the company’s customers, their
    businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including
    their ability to continue to honor their existing leases.

The company’s properties are concentrated predominantly in
    the industrial real estate sector. As a result of this
    concentration, the company feels the impact of an economic
    downturn in this sector more acutely than if the company’s
    portfolio included other property types.

Declining
    real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely
    affect the company’s earnings and financial
    condition.

The current economic downturn has generally resulted in lower
    real estate valuations, which has required the company to
    recognize real estate impairment charges on its assets. The
    company conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset
    classes in accordance with its policy of accounting for the
    impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which indicates
    that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property
    may not be fully recoverable. The intended use of an asset,
    either held for sale or held for the long term, can
    significantly impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is
    intended to be held for the long term, the impairment analysis
    is based on a two-step test. The first test measures estimated
    expected future cash flows over the holding period, including a
    residual value (undiscounted and without interest charges),
    against the carrying value of the property. If the asset fails
    the first test, then the asset carrying value is measured
    against the estimated fair value from a market participant
    standpoint, with the excess of the asset’s carrying value
    over the estimated fair value recognized as an impairment charge
    to earnings. If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is
    tested based on a one-step test, comparing the carrying value to
    the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of
    expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and
    relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and
    market conditions and the availability of capital. The company
    determines the estimated fair values based on assumptions
    regarding rental rates, costs to complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values.
    The company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams
    and the recent valuations of its two open-ended funds, which
    contain a large, geographically diversified pool of assets, all
    of which are subject to third-party appraisals on at least an
    annual basis. As a result of changing market conditions, the
    company re-evaluated the carrying value of its investments and
    recognized real estate impairment losses of $181.9 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2009 on certain of its
    investments.

The principal trigger which led to the impairment charges was
    the severe economic deterioration in some markets resulting in a
    decrease in leasing and rental rates, rising vacancies and an
    increase in capitalization rates. Additional impairments may be
    necessary in the future in the event that market conditions
    continue to deteriorate and impact the factors used to estimate
    fair value, which may include impairments relating to the
    company’s unconsolidated real estate as well as impairments
    relating to the company’s investments in its unconsolidated
    co-investment ventures. Investments in unconsolidated joint
    ventures are presented under the equity method. The equity
    method is used when the company has the ability to exercise
    significant influence over operating and financial policies of
    the joint venture but does not have control of the joint
    venture. Under the equity method, these investments are
    initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are
    subsequently adjusted to reflect the company’s
    proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint
    venture, distributions received, contributions, deferred gains
    from the contribution of properties and certain other
    adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there
    may have been a loss in value of an equity investment, the
    company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating
    the company’s ability to recover its investment or if the
    loss in value is other than temporary. To evaluate whether an
    impairment is other than temporary, the company considers
    relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the period of
    time in any unrealized loss position, the likelihood of a future
    recovery, and the company’s positive intent and ability to
    hold the investment until the forecasted recovery. If the
    company determines the loss in value is other than temporary,
    the company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the



investment at fair value. Fair value is determined through
    various valuation techniques, including, but not limited to,
    discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third
    party appraisals. During the year ended December 31, 2009,
    the company did not record any impairment on its investments in
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. There can be no assurance
    that the estimates and assumptions the company uses to assess
    impairments are accurate and will reflect actual results. A
    worsening real estate market may cause the company to reevaluate
    the assumptions used in its impairment analysis and its intent
    to hold, sell, develop or contribute properties. Impairment
    charges could adversely affect the company’s financial
    condition, results of operations and its ability to pay cash
    dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders
    and the market price of the parent company’s stock. See
    Part IV, Item 15: Note 3 of the “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed
    discussion of the real estate impairment losses recorded in the
    company’s results of operations.

The
    company may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or
    relet space as leases expire.

As of December 31, 2009, on an owned and managed basis, the
    company’s occupancy average was 91.4%

year-to-date

and the leases on 13.1% of the company’s industrial
    properties (based on annualized base rent) will expire on or
    prior to December 31, 2010. The company derives most of its
    income from rent received from its customers. Accordingly, the
    company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash
    flow and its ability to pay dividends to the parent
    company’s stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders, and the market price of the
    parent company’s stock could be adversely affected if the
    company is unable to lease vacant space at favorable rents or
    terms or at all and to promptly relet or renew expiring leases
    or if the rental rates upon leasing, renewal or reletting are
    significantly lower than expected. There can be no assurance
    that the company will be able to lease its vacant space, renew
    its expiring leases, increase its occupancy to its historical
    averages or generally realize the potential of its currently
    low-yielding assets (including the build-out and leasing of its
    development platform). Periods of economic slowdown or recession
    are likely to adversely affect the company’s leasing
    activities. If a customer experiences a downturn in its business
    or other type of financial distress, then it may be unable to
    make timely rental payments or renew its lease. Further, the
    company’s ability to rent space and the rents that it can
    charge are impacted, not only by customer demand, but by the
    number of other properties the company has to compete with to
    appeal to customers.

The
    company could be adversely affected if a significant number of
    its customers are unable to meet their lease
    obligations.

The company’s results of operations, distributable cash
    flow and the value of the parent company’s stock would be
    adversely affected if a significant number of the company’s
    customers were unable to meet their lease obligations. In the
    current economic environment, it is likely that customer
    bankruptcies will increase. If a customer seeks the protection
    of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, such customer’s
    lease may be terminated in the process and result in a reduction
    of cash flow to the company. In the event of a significant
    number of lease defaults

and/or

tenant bankruptcies, the company’s cash flow may not be
    sufficient to pay distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders and cash dividends to the parent
    company’s stockholders and repay maturing debt and any
    other obligations. As of December 31, 2009, on an owned and
    managed basis, the company did not have any single customer
    account for annualized base rent revenues greater than 3.6%.
    However, in the event of lease defaults by a significant number
    of the company’s customers, the company may incur
    substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlord.

The
    company may be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous
    terms or at all or acquisitions may not perform as it
    expects.

On a strategic and selective basis, the company may acquire
    U.S. or foreign properties, portfolios of properties or
    interests in property-owning or real-estate related entities and
    platforms, which could include large acquisitions that could
    increase the company’s size and alter its capital and
    organizational structure. Such acquisitions entail various
    risks, including the risks that the company’s investments
    may not perform or be accretive to the company’s value as
    it expects, that it may be unable to quickly and efficiently
    integrate its new acquisitions into its existing operations or,
    if applicable, contribute the acquired properties to a joint
    venture, that portfolio acquisitions may



include non-core assets, that the new investments may come with
    unexpected liabilities and that the company’s cost
    estimates for developing or bringing an acquired property up to
    market standards may prove inaccurate. The company may not be
    able to acquire assets at values above the company’s cost
    of capital. In addition, the company expects to finance future
    acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under its
    unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from private or public
    equity or debt offerings (including issuances of operating
    partnership units) and proceeds from property divestitures,
    which may not be available at favorable pricing or at all and
    which could adversely affect the company’s cash flow.
    Further, the company faces significant competition for
    attractive investment opportunities from other real estate
    investors, including both publicly-traded real estate investment
    trusts and private institutional investors and funds. This
    competition increases as quality investment opportunities arise
    at favorable pricing and investments in real estate become
    increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment.
    As a result of competition, the company may be unable to make
    additional investments as it desires or the purchase price of
    the investments may be significantly elevated. Also, the company
    may incur significant transaction-related costs in exploring and
    pursuing potential transactions it may not consummate. Any of
    the above risks could adversely affect the company’s
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the
    ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders, and the market price of the
    parent company’s stock.

The
    company is subject to risks and liabilities in connection with
    forming new joint ventures, investing in new or existing joint
    ventures, attracting third party investment and owning
    properties through joint ventures and other investment
    vehicles.

As of December 31, 2009, approximately 88.1 million
    square feet of the company’s properties were held through
    joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with
    third parties. The company’s organizational documents do
    not limit the amount of available funds that it may invest in
    partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures, and
    the company may and currently intends to develop and acquire
    properties through joint ventures, limited liability companies,
    partnerships with and investments in other entities when
    warranted by the circumstances. However, there can be no
    assurance that the company will be able to form new joint
    ventures, attract third party investment or make additional
    investments in new or existing joint ventures, successfully
    develop or acquire properties through such joint ventures, or
    realize value from such joint ventures. The company’s
    inability to do so may have an adverse effect on the
    company’s growth, its earnings and the market price of the
    parent company’s securities.

Joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over
    major decisions and some partners may manage the properties in
    the joint venture investments. Joint venture investments involve
    certain risks, including:

•

if the company’s joint venture partners go bankrupt, then
    the company and any other remaining partners may generally
    remain liable for the investment’s liabilities;

•

if the company’s joint venture partners fail to fund their
    share of any required capital contributions, then the company
    may choose to or be required to contribute such capital;

•

the company may, under certain circumstances, guarantee all or a
    portion of the joint venture’s debt, which may require the
    company to pay an amount greater than its investment in the
    joint venture;

•

the company’s joint venture partners might have economic or
    other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the
    company’s business interests or goals that would affect the
    company’s ability to operate the property;

•

the company’s joint venture partners may have the power to
    act contrary to the company’s instructions, requests,
    policies or objectives, including its current policy with
    respect to maintaining the parent company’s qualification
    as a real estate investment trust;

•

the joint venture or other governing agreements often restrict
    the transfer of an interest in the joint venture or may
    otherwise restrict the company’s ability to sell the
    interest when it desires or on advantageous terms;

•

the company’s relationships with its joint venture partners
    are generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or
    dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event,
    the company may not continue



to own or operate the interests or assets underlying such
    relationship or may need to purchase such interests or assets at
    an above-market price to continue ownership;

•

disputes between the company and its joint venture partners may
    result in litigation or arbitration that would increase the
    company’s expenses and prevent its officers and directors
    from focusing their time and effort on the company’s
    business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the
    applicable joint venture to additional risk; and

•

the company may in certain circumstances be liable for the
    actions of its joint venture partners.

The company generally seeks to maintain sufficient control or
    influence over its joint ventures to permit it to achieve its
    business objectives; however, the company may not be able to do
    so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described
    above could adversely affect the company’s financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders
    and the market price of the parent company’s stock.

The
    company may not be successful in contributing properties to its
    co-investment ventures.

The company may contribute or sell properties to certain of its
    co-investment ventures on a

case-by-case

basis. However, the company may fail to contribute properties to
    its co-investment ventures due to such factors as its inability
    to acquire, develop, or lease properties that meet the
    investment criteria of such ventures, or its co-investment
    ventures’ inability to access debt and equity capital to
    pay for property contributions or their allocation of available
    capital to cover other capital requirements such as forward
    commitments, loan maturities and future redemptions. If the
    co-investment ventures are unable to raise additional capital on
    favorable terms after available capital is depleted or if the
    value of properties to be contributed or sold to the
    co-investment ventures are appraised at less than the cost of
    such properties, then such contributions or sales could be
    delayed or prevented, adversely affecting the company’s
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders, and the market price of the
    parent company’s stock.

A delay in these contributions could result in adverse effects
    on the company’s liquidity and on its ability to meet
    projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period,
    which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results
    of operations, distributable cash flow and the value of its
    securities.

The
    company may be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous
    terms or at all.

The company may divest itself of properties, which are currently
    in its portfolio, are held for sale or which otherwise do not
    meet its strategic objectives. The company may, in certain
    circumstances, divest itself of properties to increase its
    liquidity or to capitalize on opportunities that arise. The
    company’s ability to dispose of properties on advantageous
    terms or at all depends on factors beyond its control, including
    competition from other sellers, current market conditions
    (including capitalization rates applicable to its properties)
    and the availability of financing for potential buyers of its
    properties. If the company is unable to dispose of properties on
    favorable terms or at all or redeploy the proceeds of property
    divestitures in accordance with its investment strategy, then
    the company’s financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow, ability to meet its debt obligations in a timely
    manner and the ability to pay cash dividends and distributions
    could be adversely affected, which could also negatively impact
    the market price of the parent company’s stock.

Actions
    by the company’s competitors may affect the company’s
    ability to divest properties and may decrease or prevent
    increases of the occupancy and rental rates of the
    company’s properties.

The company competes with other owners, operators and developers
    of real estate, some of which own properties similar to the
    company’s properties in the same submarkets in which the
    company’s properties are located. If the company’s
    competitors sell assets similar to assets the company intends to
    divest in the same markets

and/or

at
    valuations below the company’s valuations for comparable
    assets, the company may be unable to divest its assets at
    favorable pricing or on favorable terms or at all. In addition,
    if the company’s competitors offer space at rental rates
    below current market rates or below the rental rates the company
    currently charges its customers, the



company may lose potential customers, and the company may be
    pressured to reduce its rental rates below those the company
    currently charges in order to retain customers when its
    customers’ leases expire. As a result, the company’s
    financial condition, cash flow, cash available for distributions
    and dividends and, trading price of the parent company’s
    stock and ability to satisfy the operating partnership’s
    debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.

The
    company may be unable to complete renovation, development and
    redevelopment projects on advantageous terms or at
    all.

On a strategic and selective basis, the company may develop,
    renovate and redevelop properties. After the financial and real
    estate markets stabilize, the company may expand its investment
    in its development, renovation and redevelopment business and
    complete the build-out and leasing of its development platform.
    The company may also develop, renovate and redevelop properties
    in newly formed development joint ventures into which the
    company may contribute assets. The real estate development,
    renovation and redevelopment business involves significant risks
    that could adversely affect the company’s financial
    condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay
    cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders
    and the market price of the parent company’s stock, which
    include the following risks:

•

the company may not be able to obtain financing for development
    projects on favorable terms or at all and complete construction
    on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt
    service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing the
    properties, generating cash flow and, if applicable,
    contributing properties to a joint venture;

•

the company may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays
    in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building,
    occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations;

•

the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing
    cash flow below budgeted amounts;

•

the company may not be able to lease properties on favorable
    terms or at all;

•

construction costs, total investment amounts and the
    company’s share of remaining funding may exceed the
    company’s estimates and projects may not be completed,
    delivered or stabilized as planned;

•

the company may not be able to attract third party investment in
    new development joint ventures or sufficient customer demand for
    its product;

•

the company may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced
    value created by its value-added conversion projects on its
    expected timetables or at all;

•

the company may not be able to successfully form development
    joint ventures or capture value from such newly formed ventures;

•

the company may fail to contribute properties to its
    co-investment ventures due to such factors as its inability to
    acquire, develop, or lease properties that meet the investment
    criteria of such ventures, or its co-investment ventures’
    inability to access debt and equity capital to pay for property
    contributions or their allocation of available capital to cover
    other capital requirements such as future redemptions;

•

the company may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if
    there is public opposition to its activities;

•

substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment
    activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically
    require a significant amount of management’s time and
    attention, diverting their attention from the company’s

day-to-day

operations; and

•

upon completion of construction, the company may not be able to
    obtain, on advantageous terms or at all, permanent financing for
    activities that it has financed through construction loans.



Real
    estate investments are relatively illiquid, making it difficult
    for the company to respond promptly to changing
    conditions.

Real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of
    assets. Further, the Internal Revenue Code regulates the number
    of properties that the parent company, as a real estate
    investment trust, can dispose of in a year, their tax bases and
    the cost of improvements that the parent company makes to the
    properties. In addition, a portion of the properties held
    directly or indirectly by certain of the company’s
    subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for limited
    partnership units in the applicable partnership. The
    contribution agreements for such properties may contain
    restrictions on certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions
    of these properties, or a portion thereof, which result in a
    taxable transaction for specified periods, following the
    contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership.
    These limitations may affect the company’s ability to sell
    properties. This lack of liquidity and the Internal Revenue Code
    restrictions may limit the company’s ability to vary its
    portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other
    conditions and, as a result, could adversely affect the
    company’s financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flow, the market price of the parent company’s stock,
    the ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders, and the operating
    partnership’s ability to access capital necessary to meet
    its debt payments and other obligations.

Risks
    Associated with the Company’s International
    Business

The
    company’s international activities are subject to special
    risks and it may not be able to effectively manage its
    international business.

The company acquired and developed, and may continue to acquire
    and develop on a strategic and selective basis, properties and
    operating platforms outside the United States. Because local
    markets affect the company’s operations, the company’s
    international investments are subject to economic fluctuations
    in the international locations in which the company invests.
    Access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on
    favorable terms or at all, in certain locations. In addition,
    the company’s international operations are subject to the
    usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax
    treaties or other laws and regulations, including those
    governing the taxation of the company’s international
    revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain
    parts of the world, uncertainty over property rights, terrorist
    or gang-related activities, civil unrest and political
    instability. The company cannot predict the likelihood that any
    of these developments may occur. Further, the company has
    entered, and may in the future enter, into agreements with

non-U.S. entities

that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute
    resolution in the courts of, another country or region. The
    company cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would
    provide it with an effective and efficient means of resolving
    disputes that may arise. Further, even if the company is able to
    obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court
    proceeding, the company could have difficulty enforcing any
    award or judgment on a timely basis or at all.

The company also has offices in many countries outside the
    United States and, as a result, the company’s operations
    may be subject to risks that may limit its ability to
    effectively establish, staff and manage its offices outside the
    United States, including:

•

differing employment practices and labor issues;

•

local business and cultural factors that differ from the
    company’s usual standards and practices;

•

regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between
    jurisdictions; and

•

health concerns.

The company’s global growth (including growth in new
    regions in the United States) subjects the company to certain
    risks, including risks associated with funding increasing
    headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective
    controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new
    offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, payroll expenses are
    paid in local currencies and, therefore, the company is exposed
    to risks associated with fluctuations in the rate of exchange
    between the U.S. dollar and these currencies.

Further, the company’s business has grown rapidly and may
    continue to grow in a strategic and deliberate manner. If the
    company fails to effectively manage its international growth,
    then the company’s financial condition,



results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash
    dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders,
    and the market price of the parent company’s stock could be
    adversely affected.

The
    company is subject to risks from potential fluctuations in
    exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the
    other countries in which it invests.

The company may pursue growth opportunities in international
    markets on a strategic and selective basis. As the company
    invests in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the
    national currency, the company is subject to international
    currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates
    between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other
    countries. A significant depreciation in the value of the
    currency of one or more countries where the company has a
    significant investment may materially affect its results of
    operations. The company attempts to mitigate any such effects by
    borrowing in the currency of the country in which it is
    investing and, under certain circumstances, by putting in place
    international currency put option contracts to hedge exchange
    rate fluctuations. For leases denominated in international
    currencies, the company may use derivative financial instruments
    to manage the international currency exchange risk. The company
    cannot assure you, however, that its efforts will successfully
    neutralize all international currency risks.

Acquired
    properties may be located in new markets, where the company may
    face risks associated with investing in an unfamiliar
    market.

The company has acquired and may continue to acquire properties,
    portfolios of properties, interests in real-estate related
    entities or platforms on a strategic and selective basis in
    international markets that are new to it. When the company
    acquires properties or platforms located in these markets, it
    may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or
    understanding of the local economy, forging new business
    relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local
    government and permitting procedures. The company works to
    mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and
    associations with experienced partners; however, there can be no
    guarantee that all such risks will be eliminated.

General
    Business Risks

The
    company’s performance and value are impacted by the local
    economic conditions of and the risks associated with doing
    business in California.

As of December 31, 2009, the company’s industrial
    properties located in California represented 22.6% of the
    aggregate square footage of its industrial operating properties
    and 21.0% of its industrial annualized base rent, on an owned
    and managed basis. The company’s revenue from, and the
    value of, its properties located in California may be affected
    by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or
    reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic
    climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns,
    changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact
    California’s economic climate. Because of the number of
    properties the company has located in California, a downturn in
    California’s economy or real estate conditions could
    adversely affect the company’s financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to
    its stockholders and the market price of its stock.

The
    company faces risks associated with short-term liquid
    investments.

The company continues to have significant cash balances that it
    invests in a variety of short-term investments that are intended
    to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of
    liquidity while providing current income. From time to time,
    these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):

•

direct obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury;

•

obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or
    its agencies;

•

taxable municipal securities;

•

obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and
    thrifts;



•

commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term
    U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations
    and banks;

•

repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and
    asset-backed obligations;

•

both registered and unregistered money market funds; and

•

other highly rated short-term securities.

Investments in these securities and funds are not insured
    against loss of principal. Under certain circumstances the
    company may be required to redeem all or part of its investment,
    and its right to redeem some or all of its investment may be
    delayed or suspended. In addition, there is no guarantee that
    the company’s investments in these securities or funds will
    be redeemable at par value. A decline in the value of the
    company’s investment or a delay or suspension of its right
    to redeem may have an adverse effect on the company’s
    results of operations or financial condition.

The
    company may experience losses that its insurance does not
    cover.

The company carries commercial liability, property and rental
    loss insurance covering all the properties that it owns and
    manages in types and amounts that it believes are adequate and
    appropriate given the relative risks applicable to the property,
    the cost of coverage and industry practice. Certain losses, such
    as those due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic
    activity, may be insured subject to certain limitations,
    including large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits.
    Although the company has obtained coverage for certain acts of
    terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits that
    the company considers commercially reasonable given the cost and
    availability of such coverage, the company cannot be certain
    that it will be able to renew coverage on comparable terms or
    collect under such policies. In addition, there are other types
    of losses, such as those from riots, bio-terrorism or acts of
    war, that are not generally insured in the company’s
    industry because it is not economically feasible to do so. The
    company may incur material losses in excess of insurance
    proceeds and it may not be able to continue to obtain insurance
    at commercially reasonable rates. Given current market
    conditions, there can also be no assurance that the insurance
    companies providing the company’s coverage will not fail or
    have difficulty meeting their coverage obligations to the
    company. Furthermore, the company cannot assure you that its
    insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products
    with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If
    the company experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds
    its insured limits with respect to one or more of its properties
    or if the company’s insurance companies fail to meet their
    coverage commitments to it in the event of an insured loss, then
    the company could lose the capital invested in the damaged
    properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those
    properties and, if there is recourse debt, then the company
    would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial
    obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general
    partner of the operating partnership, the parent company
    generally will be liable for all of the operating
    partnership’s unsatisfied recourse obligations, including
    any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the
    general partner of co-investment ventures. Any such losses or
    higher insurance costs could adversely affect the company’s
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders and the market price of the
    parent company’s stock.

A number of the company’s properties are located in areas
    that are known to be subject to earthquake activity.
    U.S. properties located in active seismic areas include
    properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and
    Seattle. The company’s largest concentration of such
    properties is in California where, on an owned and managed
    basis, as of December 31, 2009, the company had 280
    industrial buildings, aggregating approximately
    30.0 million square feet and representing 22.6% of its
    industrial operating properties based on aggregate square
    footage and 21.0% based on industrial annualized base rent, on
    an owned and managed basis. International properties located in
    active seismic areas include Tokyo and Osaka, Japan and Mexico
    City, Mexico. The company carries earthquake insurance on all of
    its properties located in areas historically subject to seismic
    activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that
    it believes are commercially reasonable. The company evaluates
    its earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current
    industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside
    consultants.



A number of the company’s properties are located in areas
    that are known to be subject to hurricane

and/or

flood
    risk. The company carries hurricane and flood hazard insurance
    on all of its properties located in areas historically subject
    to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and
    deductibles that it believes are commercially reasonable. The
    company evaluates its insurance coverage annually in light of
    current industry practice through an analysis prepared by
    outside consultants.

Contingent
    or unknown liabilities could adversely affect the company’s
    financial condition.

The company has acquired and may in the future acquire
    properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or
    with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities.
    As a result, if a liability were asserted against the company
    based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties,
    then the company might have to pay substantial sums to settle
    it, which could adversely affect its cash flow. Contingent or
    unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties
    acquired might include:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

losses in excess of the company’s insured coverage;

•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
    of business;

•

tax, legal and regulatory liabilities;

•

claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the
    company’s predecessors prior to its formation or
    acquisition transactions that had not been asserted or were
    unknown prior to the company’s formation or acquisition
    transactions; and

•

claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and
    directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the
    company’s properties.

Risks
    Associated with the Company’s Dependence on Key
    Personnel

The company depends on the efforts of its executive officers and
    other key employees. From time to time, the company’s
    personnel and their roles may change. As part of the
    company’s cost savings plan, the company has reduced its
    total global headcount and may do so again in the future. While
    the company believes that it has retained its key talent, left
    its global platform intact and can find suitable employees to
    meet its personnel needs, the loss of key personnel, any change
    in their roles, or the limitation of their availability could
    adversely affect the company’s financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to
    the parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the
    operating partnership’s unitholders, and the market price
    of the parent company’s stock. The company does not have
    employment agreements with any of its executive officers.

Because the company’s compensation packages include
    equity-based incentives, pressure on the parent company’s
    stock price or limitations on the company’s ability to
    award such incentives could affect the company’s ability to
    offer competitive compensation packages to its executives and
    key employees. If the company is unable to continue to attract
    and retain its executive officers, or if compensation costs
    required to attract and retain key employees become more
    expensive, the company’s performance and competitive
    position could be materially adversely affected.

Conflicts
    of Interest Risks

Some
    of the company’s directors and executive officers are
    involved in other real estate activities and investments and,
    therefore, may have conflicts of interest with the
    company.

From time to time, certain of the company’s executive
    officers and directors may own interests in other real-estate
    related businesses and investments, including de minimis
    holdings of the equity securities of public and private real
    estate companies. The company’s executive officers’
    involvement in other real estate-related activities could divert
    their attention from the company’s

day-to-day

operations. The company’s executive officers have entered
    into non-competition agreements with the company pursuant to
    which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly
    or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to
    make any investment in respect of



any industrial or retail real estate, other than through
    ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a
    public company engaged in such activities or through certain
    specified investments. State law may limit the company’s
    ability to enforce these agreements. The company will not
    acquire any properties from its executive officers, directors or
    their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a
    majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the
    rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of the parent
    company’s board of directors with respect to that
    transaction.

The
    parent company’s role as general partner of the operating
    partnership may conflict with the interests of its
    stockholders.

As the general partner of the operating partnership, the parent
    company has fiduciary obligations to the operating
    partnership’s limited partners, the discharge of which may
    conflict with the interests of the parent company’s
    stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited
    partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on
    certain amendments to the operating partnership’s
    partnership agreement and individually to approve certain
    amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited
    partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that
    conflicts with the interests of the parent company’s
    stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating
    partnership’s partnership agreement, holders of limited
    partnership units will have approval rights with respect to
    specified transactions that affect all stockholders but which
    they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of
    all stockholders.

Risks
    Associated with Government Regulations

The
    costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and
    any related potential liability could exceed the company’s
    budgets for these items.

Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a
    current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be
    liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of
    certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at,
    on, under, in or from its property. The costs of removal or
    remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws
    typically impose liability and

clean-up

responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator
    knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more
    than one person may have been responsible for the contamination,
    each person covered by the environmental laws may be held
    responsible for all of the

clean-up

costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or
    operator of a site for damages based on personal injury,
    property damage or other costs, including investigation and

clean-up

costs, resulting from the environmental contamination.

Environmental laws in some countries, including the United
    States, also require that owners or operators of buildings
    containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos,
    adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with
    asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or
    other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during
    building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines
    and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply
    with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek
    recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated
    with exposure to asbestos. Some of the company’s properties
    are known to contain asbestos-containing building materials.

In addition, some of the company’s properties are leased or
    have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses
    that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other
    hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the
    release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain
    of the company’s properties are on, adjacent to or near
    other properties that have contained or currently contain
    petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or
    upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in
    activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances.
    From time to time, the company may acquire properties, or
    interests in properties, with known adverse environmental
    conditions where the company believes that the environmental
    liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable
    and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted
    return. In such an instance, the company underwrites the costs
    of environmental investigation,

clean-up

and
    monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtains appropriate
    environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection
    with certain divested properties, the company has agreed to
    remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or
    monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.



At the time of acquisition, the company subjects all of its
    properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by
    independent environmental consultants and the company may have
    additional Phase II testing performed upon the
    consultant’s recommendation. These environmental
    assessments have not revealed, and the company is not aware of,
    any environmental liability that it believes would have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s financial
    condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
    Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal
    all environmental liabilities and that there are material
    environmental liabilities unknown to the company, or that known
    environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are
    greater than the company anticipated. Further, the
    company’s properties’ current environmental condition
    may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations
    in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from
    underground storage tanks) or by unrelated third parties. If the
    costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws
    and regulations exceed the company’s budgets for these
    items, then the company’s financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to the
    parent company’s stockholders and distributions to the
    operating partnership’s unitholders, and the market price
    of the parent company’s stock could be adversely affected.

Compliance
    or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act
    and other similar regulations could result in substantial
    costs.

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public
    accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to
    access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result
    in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the
    award of damages to private litigants. If the company is
    required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the
    Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access
    barriers, then the company’s cash flow and the amounts
    available for dividends to the parent company’s
    stockholders and distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders may be adversely affected. The
    company’s properties are also subject to various federal,
    state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local
    fire and life-safety requirements. The company could incur fines
    or private damage awards if it fails to comply with these
    requirements. While the company believes that its properties are
    currently in material compliance with these regulatory
    requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements
    may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated
    expenditures by the company that will affect its cash flow and
    results of operations.

Federal
    Income Tax Risks

The
    parent company’s failure to qualify as a real estate
    investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to its
    stockholders.

The parent company elected to be taxed as a real estate
    investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal
    Revenue Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended
    December 31, 1997. The parent company believes it has
    operated so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust
    under the Internal Revenue Code and believes that the parent
    company’s current organization and method of operation
    comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the
    Internal Revenue Code to enable it to continue to qualify as a
    real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that the
    parent company has been organized or has operated in a manner
    that would not allow it to qualify as a real estate investment
    trust, or that the parent company’s future operations could
    cause it to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate
    investment trust requires the parent company to satisfy numerous
    requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis)
    established under highly technical and complex sections of the
    Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial
    and administrative interpretations, and involves the
    determination of various factual matters and circumstances not
    entirely within the parent company’s control. For example,
    in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the
    parent company must derive at least 95% of its gross income in
    any year from qualifying sources. In addition, the parent
    company must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating
    annually at least 90% of its real estate investment trust
    taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid
    deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy
    specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. While historically
    the parent company has satisfied the distribution requirement
    discussed above by making cash distributions to its
    stockholders, the parent company may choose to satisfy this
    requirement by making distributions of cash or other property,
    including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. For
    distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before
    December 31, 2011, and in some cases declared as late as
    December 31, 2012, recent Internal Revenue



Service guidance allows the parent company to satisfy up to 90%
    of this distribution requirement through the distribution of
    shares of its stock, if certain conditions are met. The
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury
    regulations regarding qualification as a real estate investment
    trust are more complicated in the parent company’s case
    because it holds its assets through the operating partnership.
    Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or
    court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with
    respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or
    the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.
    However, the parent company is not aware of any pending tax
    legislation that would adversely affect its ability to qualify
    as a real estate investment trust.

If the parent company fails to qualify as a real estate
    investment trust in any taxable year, the parent company will be
    required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable
    alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular
    corporate rates. Unless the parent company is entitled to relief
    under certain statutory provisions, the parent company would be
    disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust
    for the four taxable years following the year in which the
    parent company lost its qualification. If the parent company
    lost its real estate investment trust status, the parent
    company’s net earnings available for investment or
    distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for
    each of the years involved. In addition, the parent company
    would no longer be required to make distributions to its
    stockholders.

Furthermore, the parent company owns a direct or indirect
    interest in certain subsidiary REITs which elected to be taxed
    as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal
    Revenue Code. Provided that each subsidiary REIT qualifies as a
    REIT, the parent company’s interest in such subsidiary REIT
    will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes
    of the REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains
    derived by the parent company from such subsidiary REIT will
    generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of
    the REIT gross income tests. To qualify as a REIT, the
    subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT
    qualification requirements. If such subsidiary REIT were to fail
    to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions did not
    apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and
    its income would be subject to United States federal income tax.
    In addition, a failure of the subsidiary REIT to qualify as a
    REIT would have an adverse effect on the parent company’s
    ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus
    the parent company’s ability to qualify as a REIT.

Certain
    property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income,
    resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the
    transaction.

From time to time, the company may transfer or otherwise dispose
    of some of its properties, including by contributing properties
    to its co-investment venture funds. Under the Internal Revenue
    Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties the
    company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in
    the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a
    prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. The
    company does not believe that its transfers or disposals of
    property or its contributions of properties into its
    co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. However,
    whether property is held for investment purposes is a question
    of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances
    surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue
    Service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of
    properties by the company or contributions of properties into
    the company’s co-investment venture funds are prohibited
    transactions. While the company believes that the Internal
    Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the
    Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a
    transfer, disposition, or contribution of property constituted a
    prohibited transaction, the company would be required to pay a
    100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to the company from the
    prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited
    transaction might adversely affect the company’s ability to
    satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate
    investment trust.

The
    parent company may in the future choose to pay dividends in its
    own stock, in which case you may be required to pay tax in
    excess of the cash you receive.

The parent company may distribute taxable dividends that are
    partially payable in cash and partially payable in its stock.
    Under recent IRS guidance, up to 90% of any such taxable
    dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011, and
    in some cases declared as late as December 31, 2012, could
    be payable in the parent company’s stock if certain
    conditions are met. Taxable stockholders receiving such
    dividends will be required to include the full



amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of the
    parent company’s current and accumulated earnings and
    profits for United States federal income tax purposes. As a
    result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with
    respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received. If a
    U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend
    in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than
    the amount included in income with respect to the dividend,
    depending on the market price of the parent company’s stock
    at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to

non-U.S. stockholders,

the parent company may be required to withhold U.S. tax
    with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a
    portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition,
    if a significant number of the parent company’s
    stockholders determine to sell shares of its stock in order to
    pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the
    trading price of the parent company’s stock.

Legislative
    or regulatory action could adversely affect the parent
    company’s stockholders.

In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and
    administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax
    laws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities.
    Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur
    in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such
    changes will not adversely affect the taxation of the parent
    company, the operating partnership, any stockholder of the
    parent company or any limited partner of the operating
    partnership.

Risks
    Associated with Ownership of the Parent Company’s
    Stock

Limitations
    in the parent company’s charter and bylaws could prevent a
    change in control.

Certain provisions of the parent company’s charter and
    bylaws may delay, defer or prevent a change in control or other
    transaction that could provide the holders of the parent
    company’s common stock with the opportunity to realize a
    premium over the then-prevailing market price for the common
    stock. To maintain the parent company’s qualification as a
    real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes,
    not more than 50% in value of the parent company’s
    outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by
    five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue
    Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a
    taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real
    estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, the
    parent company’s common stock must be held by a minimum of
    100 persons for at least 335 days of a

12-month

taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In
    addition, if the parent company, or an owner of 10% or more of
    the parent company’s stock, actually or constructively owns
    10% or more of one of the parent company’s customers (or a
    customer of any partnership in which the company is a partner),
    then the rent received by the parent company (either directly or
    through any such partnership) from that customer will not be
    qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment
    trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help
    the parent company maintain its qualification as a real estate
    investment trust for federal income tax purposes, the parent
    company prohibits the ownership, actually or by virtue of the
    constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
    by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of
    shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and
    outstanding shares of each of the parent company’s common
    stock, series L preferred stock, series M preferred
    stock, series O preferred stock, and series P
    preferred stock (unless such limitations are waived by the
    parent company’s board of directors). The parent company
    refers to this limitation as the “ownership limit.”
    The charter provides that shares acquired or held in violation
    of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the
    benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. The charter
    further provides that any person who acquires shares in
    violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any
    dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or
    receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in
    excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the
    amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation
    of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The
    ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
    preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely
    affect the parent company’s stockholders’ ability to
    realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the
    shares of the parent company’s common stock in connection
    with such transaction.

The parent company’s charter authorizes it to issue
    additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish
    the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class
    of preferred stock that the parent company issues. The parent
    company’s board of directors could establish a series or
    class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying,
    deferring or preventing a transaction, including a change in
    control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock
    or otherwise be in the best interests of the parent
    company’s stockholders.



The parent company’s charter and bylaws and Maryland law
    also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by
    stockholders without the approval of the parent company’s
    board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a
    transaction, including a change in control. The parent
    company’s charter and bylaws include the following
    provisions:

•

directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a
    two-thirds vote of stockholders;

•

the parent company’s board can fix the number of directors
    within set limits (which limits are subject to change by the
    parent company’s board), and fill vacant directorships upon
    the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though
    less than a quorum, or in the case of a vacancy resulting from
    an increase in the size of the board, a majority of the entire
    board;

•

stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or
    propose business for consideration at a stockholders’
    meeting; and

•

the request of the holders of 50% or more of the parent
    company’s common stock is necessary for stockholders to
    call a special meeting.

Maryland law includes the following provisions:

•

a two-thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend the
    parent company’s charter; and

•

stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous
    approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in
    question.

In addition, the parent company’s board could elect to
    adopt, without stockholder approval, other provisions under
    Maryland law that may impede a change in control.

If the
    parent company issues additional securities, then the investment
    of existing stockholders will be diluted.

As the parent company is a real estate investment trust, the
    company is dependent on external sources of capital and the
    parent company may issue common or preferred stock and the
    operating partnership may issue debt securities to fund the
    company’s future capital needs. The company has the
    authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or
    debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership or AMB
    Property II, L.P., one of the company’s subsidiaries, to
    issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or
    otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to
    acquire any additional securities issued by the operating
    partnership, AMB Property II, L.P., or the parent company and
    any issuance of additional equity securities may adversely
    affect the market price of the parent company’s stock and
    could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s
    investment.

Earnings,
    cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the
    price of the parent company’s stock.

As the parent company is a real estate investment trust, the
    market value of the parent company’s equity securities, in
    general, is based primarily upon the market’s perception of
    the parent company’s growth potential and its current and
    potential future earnings and cash dividends. The market value
    of the parent company’s equity securities is based
    secondarily upon the market value of its underlying real estate
    assets. For this reason, shares of the parent company’s
    stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than its net
    asset value per share. To the extent that the parent company
    retains operating cash flow for investment purposes, working
    capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while
    increasing the value of the parent company’s underlying
    assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of its
    stock. The parent company’s failure to meet the
    market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and
    cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of
    the parent company’s stock. Further, the distribution yield
    on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock)
    relative to market interest rates may also influence the price
    of the parent company’s stock. An increase in market
    interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of the parent
    company’s stock to expect a higher distribution yield,
    which would adversely affect the parent company’s
    stock’s market price. Additionally, if the market price of
    the parent company’s stock declines significantly, then the
    operating partnership might breach certain covenants with
    respect to its debt obligations, which could adversely affect
    the company’s liquidity and ability to make future



acquisitions and the parent company’s ability to pay cash
    dividends to its stockholders and the operating
    partnership’s ability to pay distributions to its
    unitholders.

The parent company’s board of directors has decided to
    align the parent company’s regular dividend payments with
    the projected taxable income from recurring operations alone.
    The parent company may make special distributions going forward,
    as necessary, related to taxable income associated with any
    asset dispositions and gain activity. In the past, the parent
    company’s board of directors has suspended dividends to the
    parent company’s stockholders, and it is possible that they
    may do so again in the future, or decide to pay dividends in the
    parent company’s own stock as provided for in the Internal
    Revenue Code.

The
    parent company could change its investment and financing
    policies without a vote of stockholders.

Subject to the parent company’s current investment policy
    to maintain the parent company’s qualification as a real
    estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by the
    parent company’s board of directors under certain
    circumstances), the parent company’s board of directors
    determines the company’s investment and financing policies,
    its growth strategy and its debt, capitalization, distribution
    and operating policies. The parent company’s board of
    directors may revise or amend these strategies and policies at
    any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may
    not serve the interests of all of the parent company’s
    stockholders or the operating partnership’s unitholders and
    could adversely affect the company’s financial condition or
    results of operations, including its ability to pay cash
    dividends to the parent company’s stockholders and
    distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders.

Shares
    available for future sale could adversely affect the market
    price of the parent company’s common stock.

The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had
    3,376,141 common limited partnership units issued and
    outstanding as of December 31, 2009, all of which are
    currently exchangeable on a

one-for-one

basis into shares of the parent company’s common stock. In
    the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P.
    may issue additional limited partnership units, and the parent
    company may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the
    acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares
    of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon
    exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public
    securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights
    that the parent company has granted, or may grant in connection
    with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144 under the
    Securities Act of 1933. In addition, common stock issued under
    the company’s stock option and incentive plans may also be
    sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that the
    parent company has filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of
    December 31, 2009, under the company’s stock option
    and incentive plans, the company had 6,079,937 shares of
    common stock reserved and available for future issuance, had
    outstanding options to purchase 8,107,697 shares of common
    stock (of which 5,807,455 are vested and exercisable and
    3,200,220 have exercise prices below market value at
    December 31, 2009) and had 918,753 unvested restricted
    shares of common stock outstanding. Future sales of a
    substantial number of shares of the parent company’s common
    stock in the market or the perception that such sales might
    occur could adversely affect the market price of the parent
    company’s common stock. Further, the existence of the
    common limited partnership units of the operating partnership
    and AMB Property II, L.P. and the shares of the parent
    company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange
    of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and
    registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the
    terms upon which the parent company is able to obtain additional
    capital through the sale of equity securities.

Risks
    Associated with the Company’s Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures and Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The
    company’s business could be adversely impacted if it has
    deficiencies in its disclosure controls and procedures or
    internal control over financial reporting.

The design and effectiveness of the company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures and internal control over financial
    reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or
    misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the
    effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures and internal control over



financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting will be
    effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the
    time. Furthermore, the company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures and internal control over financial reporting with
    respect to entities that the company does not control or manage
    or third-party entities that the company may acquire may be
    substantially more limited than those the company maintains with
    respect to the subsidiaries that the company has controlled or
    managed over the course of time. Deficiencies, including any
    material weakness, in the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting which may occur in the future could result
    in misstatements of the company’s results of operations,
    restatements of its financial statements, a decline in the
    parent company’s stock price, or otherwise materially
    adversely affect the company’s business, reputation,
    results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

INDUSTRIAL
    PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2009, the company owned and managed
    1,101 industrial buildings aggregating approximately
    132.6 million rentable square feet (on a consolidated
    basis, the company had 684 industrial buildings aggregating
    approximately 73.7 million rentable square feet), excluding
    development and renovation projects and recently completed
    development projects available for sale or contribution, located
    in 47 global markets throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia.
    The company’s industrial properties were 91.2% leased to
    2,481 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than
    3.6% of the company’s annualized base rent from its
    industrial properties. See Part IV, Item 15:
    Note 18 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for segment information related to the
    company’s operations.

Lease Terms.

The company’s industrial
    properties are typically subject to leases on a “triple net
    basis,” in which customers pay their proportionate share of
    real estate taxes, insurance and operating costs, or are subject
    to leases on a “modified gross basis,” in which
    customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. In
    addition, most of the company’s leases include fixed rental
    increases or Consumer Price Index-based rental increases. Lease
    terms typically range from three to ten years, with a weighted
    average of six years, excluding renewal options. However, the
    majority of the company’s industrial leases do not include
    renewal options.

Within these metropolitan areas, the company’s industrial
    properties are generally concentrated in locations with limited
    new construction opportunities within established, relatively
    large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate
    of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere.
    These infill locations are typically near major airports or
    seaports or convenient to major highway systems and rail lines,
    and are proximate to large and diverse labor pools. There is
    typically broad demand for industrial space in these
    centrally-located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries
    and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution,
    light assembly and manufacturing. The company generally avoids
    locations at the periphery of metropolitan areas where there are
    fewer constraints to the supply of additional industrial
    properties.

PROPERTIES
    HELD THROUGH CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES
    AND PARTNERSHIPS

The company holds interests in both consolidated and
    unconsolidated joint ventures. The company consolidates joint
    ventures where it exhibits financial or operational control.
    Control is determined using accounting standards related to the
    consolidation of joint ventures and variable interest
    entities

.

For joint ventures that are defined as variable
    interest entities, the primary beneficiary consolidates the
    entity. In instances where the company is not the primary
    beneficiary, it does not consolidate the joint venture for
    financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures that are not
    defined as variable interest entities, management first
    considers whether the company is the general partner or a
    limited partner (or the equivalent in such investments which are
    not structured as partnerships). The company consolidates joint
    ventures where it is the general partner (or the equivalent) and
    the limited partners (or the equivalent) in such investments do
    not have rights which would preclude control and, therefore,
    consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For joint
    ventures where the company is the general partner (or the
    equivalent), but does not control the joint venture as the other
    partners (or the equivalent) hold substantive participating
    rights, the company uses the equity method of accounting. For
    joint ventures where the company is a limited partner (or the
    equivalent), management considers factors such as ownership
    interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and
    contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners
    (or the equivalent) to determine if the presumption that the
    general partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances
    where these factors indicate the company controls the joint
    venture, the company consolidates the joint venture; otherwise
    it uses the equity method of accounting.

Consolidated
    Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2009, the company held interests in
    co-investment ventures, limited liability companies and
    partnerships with institutional investors and other third
    parties, which it consolidates in its financial statements.
    Under the agreements governing the co-investment ventures, the
    company and the other party to the co-investment venture may be
    required to make additional capital contributions and, subject
    to certain limitations, the co-investment ventures may incur
    additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain
    restrictions on the transfer of co-investment venture interests
    by the company or the other party to the co-investment venture
    and typically provide certain rights to the company or the other
    party to the co-investment venture to sell the company’s or
    their interest in the co-investment venture to the co-investment
    venture or to the other co-investment venture partner on terms
    specified in the agreement. In addition, under certain
    circumstances, many of the co-investment ventures include
    buy/sell provisions. See Part IV, Item 15:
    Notes 11 and 12 of the “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements” for additional details.

    the company’s accounting for its investment because of
    changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general
    partner’s rights effective October 1, 2006. On
    July 1, 2008, the partners of AMB Partners II, L.P.
    (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) contributed
    their interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. to AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P. in exchange for interests in AMB

    co-investment venture. During 2009, the company contributed to
    this co-investment venture two completed development projects,
    aggregating approximately 0.4 million square feet, for
    additional units in the fund equal to 100% of the fair value of
    the assets, for an aggregate price of approximately
    $32.5 million. During 2008, the company contributed to this

    co-investment venture with institutional investors, in which the
    company retained an approximate 20% interest upon formation. At
    the time of formation, the institutional investors committed
    approximately 263.0 million Euros (approximately
    $376.8 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange
    rate at December 31, 2009) for an approximate



80% equity interest. During 2009, the company made no

    company’s interest in the contributed properties acquired
    by the third-party investors for cash, as a result of the
    contribution of approximately 0.8 million square feet of
    industrial operating properties to AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. During the year ended December 31,
    2007, the company contributed industrial operating properties

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our
    consolidated financial condition and results of operations in
    conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Management’s
    Overview

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, the company began to be
    impacted by the economic, financial and real estate market
    crisis. To maintain its competitive advantage, the company
    established three key near-term priorities for 2009 which
    included: strengthening its balance sheet and liquidity
    position; reducing its cost structure; and positioning for
    future growth opportunities.

Management believes that in 2009 it successfully executed on
    these near-term priorities, which enabled the company to
    navigate through a challenging environment, and that the company
    is now positioned to pursue growth opportunities. As such, the
    company has established three key growth initiatives for 2010,
    which include:

•

improving the utilization of its existing assets;

•

acquiring industrial real estate with total returns above the
    company’s cost of capital; and

•

forming new private capital ventures and funds.

Management believes that the leading indicators for economic
    recovery reached an inflection point during the fourth quarter
    and expects that improving economic conditions will lead to an
    increase in the demand for industrial real estate. Management
    expects to see earnings growth if it is able to improve asset
    utilization by returning its owned and managed portfolio closer
    to its historical occupancy average of 95%; complete the
    build-out and leasing of its development portfolio; and realize
    value from its land bank through new ventures, sales and future

build-to-suit

projects. The company believes that capital deployment
    opportunities are increasing and is evaluating multiple
    transactions in its target markets around the globe. Management
    believes that its ability to provide multiple forms of
    consideration to institutional investors, lenders and private
    developers provide the company with proprietary access to
    acquisition opportunities. The company is also observing a
    positive shift in investor interest and believes that this
    growing level of interest is being met by the scarcity of high
    quality, well-located industrial real estate. Management
    believes that its existing and new private capital funds and
    ventures are well positioned to benefit from this shift in
    investor preferences.

The
    Company’s Liquidity and Balance Sheet

Management believes that the company’s financial position
    is strong and its debt maturity schedule is well laddered.
    During 2009, the company completed approximately
    $2.7 billion of debt repayments, repurchases and
    extensions, of which $1.6 billion occurred in the fourth
    quarter. Notable transactions during 2009, which further
    strengthened the company’s liquidity position included:

•

The issuance and sale of 47.4 million shares of its common
    stock for net proceeds of approximately $552.3 million,
    during the first quarter;

•

The issuance of $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes
    consisting of a $250.0 million tranche at 6.13% due 2016
    and a $250.0 million tranche at 6.63% due 2019;

•

The refinancing of its $325.0 million unsecured term loan
    facility with a $345.0 million multi-currency facility,
    maturing October 2012, which was subsequently upsized to
    $425.0 million in December 2009;

•

The early repayment of its $230.0 million secured term loan
    facility originally due September 2010;

•

The completion of the repurchase of $213.6 million in bonds
    including $168.9 million in connection with its cash tender
    offer of notes due 2011 and 2013 and $44.7 million of open
    market repurchases of notes due 2010 and 2013 with a weighted
    average yield-to maturity of 4.74%, and the completion of a cash
    tender offer for $146.5 million and $28.5 million in
    aggregate principal amount of the operating partnership’s
    5.45% medium-term notes due 2010 and 8.0% medium-term notes due
    2010, respectively; and



•

The purchase of AMB Property II, L.P.’s outstanding 7.18%
    series D cumulative redeemable preferred units in exchange
    for 2.9 million shares of the parent company’s common
    stock for an aggregate price of $67.8 million, which
    represented a 15% discount to the liquidation preference.

As a result of its 2009 financing activity, the company reduced
    its share of total

debt-to-its

share of total assets to 43.6% from 51.1% and extended the
    weighted average remaining life of over 25% of its debt to more
    than five and a half years at an average interest rate of 4.9%.
    Having resolved its near-term maturities, the company embarked
    on a strategy, during the fourth quarter, to further lengthen
    its maturity schedule to minimize its debt maturities through
    2013. Management believes this strategy will provide it with
    maximum flexibility and further position the company to take
    advantage of opportunities as they arise.

As of December 31, 2009, the company’s total
    consolidated debt maturities for 2010 after extension options
    (subject to certain conditions) were $322.4 million,
    excluding principal amortization. The company had unconsolidated
    debt maturities of $148.2 million for 2010 after extension
    options (subject to certain conditions) as of December 31,
    2009, excluding principal amortization.

During 2009, the company disposed of $762.9 million of
    properties with a weighted average stabilized capitalization
    rate of 6.8%. During the fourth quarter, the company completed
    dispositions totaling $92.9 million, with a weighted
    average stabilized capitalization rate of 8.2%.

During 2009, the company increased the availability under its
    lines of credit by approximately $441 million while
    reducing its share of outstanding debt by approximately
    $713 million. As of December 31, 2009, the company had
    $1.2 billion available for future borrowings under its
    three multi-currency lines of credit, representing line
    utilization of 30%, and had cash, cash equivalents and
    restricted cash of $206.1 million.

The
    Company’s Cost Structure

To address the challenges of the current business environment,
    the company implemented a broad-based cost reduction plan that
    began in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result of this plan,
    the company reduced its total global headcount by approximately
    one third and reduced gross G&A costs by approximately
    $60.0 million on a run-rate basis as of December 31,
    2009. In executing these cost-saving efforts, the company
    believes that it has preserved its ability to serve its global
    customers and manage its industrial operating and development
    portfolios. While the company has removed excess capacity in its
    capital deployment teams, it believes that it has retained its
    key talent and left its global capabilities intact.

During the fourth quarter, the company began the process of
    outsourcing various global property accounting and certain back
    office functions. The company believes that this initiative will
    improve the efficiency, cost structure and scalability of its
    back office operations. The company incurred $2.5 million
    in severance costs during the fourth quarter and expects to
    realize $2-3 million of additional restructuring costs in
    2010 related to completing this initiative. Management believes
    that it will produce approximately $5.0 million in annual
    savings upon the completion of this initiative.

Real
    Estate Operations

During 2009, industrial property fundamentals were the most
    challenging on record. According to data provided by CBRE
    Econometric Advisors as of January 25, 2010, availability
    in the United States reached a historical high of 13.9% for the
    quarter ended December 31, 2009, up 40 basis points
    from the prior quarter and 250 basis points from the fourth
    quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, industrial net
    absorption was negative 265 million square feet, the lowest
    on record. The negative trend decelerated over the course of the
    year, slowing to a negative 38 million square feet in the
    fourth quarter. Within the U.S., the company believes that its
    coastal markets will continue to outperform other
    U.S. industrial markets, as evidenced by flat net
    absorption and availability unchanged at 12.1% in the fourth
    quarter. The company continues to believe that the primary
    infill markets tied to global trade remain relatively strong.

Also according to CBRE Econometric Advisors, new construction
    was at an all time low of 71 million square feet for 2009
    and 15.2 million square feet for the fourth quarter. While
    the company expects the delivery pipeline to continue to
    decline, the company expects net absorption to be positive in
    the second half of 2010. At the end of the



third quarter, the global market fundamentals began to show
    early signs of stability. Globally, industrial demand is still
    soft, but management believes that it is seeing signs of
    increased customer activity and decision making. Market
    occupancy declines are slowing globally and leasing activity has
    increased. Market rents remain lower than a year ago and the
    company expects rent changes on rollovers to continue to trend
    down through 2010.

Current forecasts for 2010, according to the IMF, indicate that
    global GDP is expected to increase by 3.9% and global trade by
    6%, all of which should lead to inventory rebuilding and demand
    for industrial real estate. The company believes that while the
    leading indicators for demand for industrial real estate have
    reached an inflection point, recovery in operating fundamentals
    will lag behind the recovery in the macro economy as it has in
    prior cycles. Management expects that its operating fundamentals
    in the first half of 2010 will be consistent with occupancy in
    the fourth quarter of 2009 before improving by the end of 2010.
    Rent changes on rollover are expected to be negative for 2010.

For 2009, the company generated $406.9 million of net
    operating income, on a consolidated basis, from its real estate
    operations. The company’s owned and managed portfolio
    occupancy during the three months ended December 31, 2009
    was 91.2%, up 20 basis points from September 30, 2009.
    Average occupancy during the three months ended
    December 31, 2009 was 90.7%, up 30 basis points from
    the three months ended September 30, 2009. During the three
    months ended December 31, 2009, rent changes on rollovers
    in the company’s industrial operating portfolio declined by
    11.5% on an owned and managed basis, excluding expense
    reimbursements, rental abatements, percentage rents and
    straight-line rents. Rental rates on lease renewals and
    rollovers in the company’s portfolio declined by 6.9% for
    the trailing four quarters ended December 31, 2009.

During the quarter, cash-basis same store net operating income
    without the effect of lease termination fees, decreased by 7.3%
    and 4.5% for the full year 2009 on an owned and managed basis.
    Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements
    against the U.S. dollar, cash-basis same store net
    operating income without the effect of lease termination fees
    decreased 8.9% for the fourth quarter and 4.7% for the full year
    2009. See “Supplemental Earnings Measures” below for a
    discussion of cash-basis same store net operating income and a
    reconciliation of cash-basis same store net operating income and
    net income.

As of December 31, 2009, the accounts receivable levels
    were consistent with historical levels, during recessionary
    periods, and management believes that the accounts receivable
    are leveling and that it continues to maintain adequate bad debt
    reserves. Although the number of bankruptcies of its customers
    increased during 2009, the company believes the impact of such
    bankruptcies on its business was not significant for the quarter
    and year ended December 31, 2009.

Private
    Capital Business

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the company generated
    private capital revenues of $37.9 million, of which
    $10.5 million occurred in the fourth quarter. During the
    first quarter, the company contributed one $185.0 million
    development project to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. During the
    third quarter, the company transferred two assets to AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. in exchange for
    additional units equal to the fair value of the assets, for an
    aggregate price of $32.5 million, increasing its ownership
    interest in the fund to 22.7% from 19.3%.

Subsequent to year end, the company’s two open-ended funds
    completed approximately $267.0 million in net capital
    transactions consisting of: $50.0 million in new
    third-party equity in AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III;
    $67.0 million in investor-elected redemption withdrawals,
    thereby reducing AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III’s
    redemption queue to $14.9 million as of February 1,
    2010; the company’s $100.0 million investment in AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III; and its $50.0 million
    investment in AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS.

Equityholders in two of the company’s co-investment
    ventures, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and AMB
    Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, have a right to request that the
    ventures redeem their interests under certain conditions. The
    redemption right of investors in AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS
    is exercisable beginning after July 1, 2011.

Development
    Business

Given the uncertainty in the global economy during 2009, the
    company limited its development activity to previously committed
    projects. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    company commenced development



on four previously committed development projects for a total
    estimated investment cost of $60.6 million. In addition to
    its committed development pipeline, as of December 31,
    2009, the company held a total of 2,488 acres of land for
    future development or sale on an owned and managed basis,
    approximately 85% of which is located in the Americas. The
    company currently estimates that these 2,488 acres of land
    could support approximately 45.1 million square feet of
    future development.

Impairment
    Charges

The company recognized real estate impairment charges on certain
    of its assets of $181.9 million in the first quarter of
    2009 and of $193.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
    The principal trigger which led to the impairment charges was
    the severe economic deterioration in some markets resulting in a
    decrease in leasing and rental rates, rising vacancies and an
    increase in capitalization rates. Additional impairments may be
    necessary in the future in the event that market conditions
    continue to deteriorate and impact the factors used to estimate
    fair value, which may include impairments relating to the
    company’s unconsolidated real estate as well as impairments
    relating to the company’s investments in its unconsolidated
    co-investment ventures. See Part IV, Item 15:
    Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the real
    estate impairment losses recorded in the company’s results
    of operations during the year ended December 31, 2009.

Summary
    of Key Transactions

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company
    completed the following significant capital deployment and other
    transactions:

•

Contributed one completed development project aggregating
    approximately 1.0 million square feet for an aggregate
    price of approximately $184.8 million (using the exchange
    rate in effect on the date of contribution) to AMB Japan
    Fund I, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture;

•

Sold development projects aggregating approximately
    3.1 million square feet, including 1.1 million square
    feet that was held in an unconsolidated co-investment venture,
    and three land parcels totaling 35 acres for an aggregate
    sales price of $347.5 million;

•

Sold industrial operating properties aggregating approximately
    2.9 million square feet, including 0.6 million square

•

Transferred two development assets to AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. in exchange for additional partnership units
    equal to the fair value of the assets for an aggregate price of
    $32.5 million and aggregating approximately
    0.4 million square feet.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 4 and 5 of the
    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a
    more detailed discussion of the company’s acquisition,
    development and disposition activity.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The company’s discussion and analysis of financial
    condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated
    financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements
    requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect
    the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as
    of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The
    company evaluates its assumptions and estimates on an on-going
    basis. The company bases its estimates on historical experience
    and on various other assumptions that it believes to be
    reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
    the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
    assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
    sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
    different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the
    following critical accounting policies affect its more
    significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
    its consolidated financial statements.



Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless
    circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which
    case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is
    made to reduce it to its estimated fair value. The company also
    regularly reviews the impact of above or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions,
    and records an intangible asset or liability accordingly.

The company conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate
    asset classes in accordance with its policy of accounting for
    the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which indicates
    that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property
    may not be fully recoverable. The intended use of an asset,
    either held for sale or held for the long term, can
    significantly impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is
    intended to be held for the long term, the impairment analysis
    is based on a two-step test. The first test measures estimated
    expected future cash flows over the holding period, including a
    residual value (undiscounted and without interest charges),
    against the carrying value of the property. If the asset fails
    the test, then the asset carrying value is measured against the
    estimated fair value from a market participant standpoint, with
    the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated
    fair value recognized as an impairment charge to earnings. If an
    asset is intended to be sold, impairment is tested based on a
    one-step test, comparing the carrying value to the estimated
    fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of expected future
    net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions
    regarding current and future economic and market conditions and
    the availability of capital. The company determines the
    estimated fair values based on assumptions regarding rental
    rates, costs to complete,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values.
    The company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams
    and the recent valuations of its two open-ended funds, which
    contain a large, geographically diversified pool of assets, all
    of which are subject to third-party appraisals on at least an
    annual basis.

Revenue Recognition.

The company records
    rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis
    over the term of the leases and maintains an allowance for
    estimated losses that may result from the inability of the
    company’s customers to make required payments. If customers
    fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than
    the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts, security
    deposits and letters of credit, then the company may have to
    recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods.
    The company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its
    customers on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial
    condition periodically as appropriate. Each period the company
    reviews its outstanding accounts receivable, including
    straight-line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide
    allowances as needed. The company also records lease termination
    fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination
    agreement with the company and the payment of the termination
    fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived
    before the fee is due to the company. If a customer remains in
    the leased space following the execution of a definitive
    termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are
    deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s
    occupancy.

Property Dispositions.

The company reports
    real estate dispositions in four separate categories on its
    consolidated statements of operations. First, when the company
    divests a portion of its interests in real estate entities or
    properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired
    by third-party investors for cash and are included in gains from
    sale or contribution of real estate interests in the statements
    of operations. Second, the company disposes of value-added
    conversion projects and

build-to-suit

and speculative development projects for which it has not
    generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or
    loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is
    reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and is
    included in development profits, net of taxes, within continuing
    operations of the statements of operations. Third, the company
    disposes of value-added conversion and other redevelopment
    projects for which it may have generated material operating
    income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized is reported
    net of estimated taxes, when applicable, in the development
    profits, net of taxes, line within discontinued operations.
    Lastly, guidance related to accounting for the impairment or
    disposal of long-lived assets requires the company to separately
    report as discontinued operations the historical operating
    results attributable to industrial operating properties sold and
    the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the
    properties, which is included in development profits and gains
    from sale of real estate interests, net of taxes, in the
    statements of operations. The consolidated statements of
    operations for prior periods are also retrospectively adjusted
    to conform with new guidance regarding accounting for
    discontinued operations and noncontrolling interests, and there
    is no impact on the company’s previously reported
    consolidated financial position, net income or



cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using
    the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to
    transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full
    accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when
    the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met.

Joint Ventures.

The company holds interests in
    both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. The company
    consolidates joint ventures where it exhibits financial or
    operational control. Control is determined using accounting
    standards related to the consolidation of joint ventures and
    variable interest entities. For joint ventures that are defined
    as variable interest entities, the primary beneficiary
    consolidates the entity. In instances where the company is not
    the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the joint
    venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures
    that are not defined as variable interest entities, management
    first considers whether the company is the general partner or a
    limited partner (or the equivalent in such investments which are
    not structured as partnerships). The company consolidates joint
    ventures where it is the general partner (or the equivalent) and
    the limited partners (or the equivalent) in such investments do
    not have rights which would preclude control and, therefore,
    consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For joint
    ventures where the company is the general partner (or the
    equivalent), but does not control the joint venture as the other
    partners (or the equivalent) hold substantive participating
    rights, the company uses the equity method of accounting. For
    joint ventures where the company is a limited partner (or the
    equivalent), management considers factors such as ownership
    interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and
    contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners
    (or the equivalent) to determine if the presumption that the
    general partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances
    where these factors indicate the company controls the joint
    venture, the company consolidates the joint venture; otherwise
    it uses the equity method of accounting.

Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are presented under
    the equity method. Under the equity method, these investments
    are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are
    subsequently adjusted to reflect the company’s
    proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint
    venture, distributions received, contributions, deferred gains
    from the contribution of properties and certain other
    adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there
    may have been a loss in value of an equity investment, the
    company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating
    the company’s ability to recover its investment or if the
    loss in value is other than temporary. To evaluate whether an
    impairment is other than temporary, the company considers
    relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the period of
    time in any unrealized loss position, the likelihood of a future
    recovery, and the company’s positive intent and ability to
    hold the investment until the forecasted recovery. If the
    company determines the loss in value is other than temporary,
    the company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the
    investment at fair value. Fair value is determined through
    various valuation techniques, including, but not limited to,
    discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third
    party appraisals.

Real Estate Investment Trust.

As a real estate
    investment trust, the parent company generally will not be
    subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the United
    States if it meets minimum distribution requirements, and
    certain income, asset and share ownership tests. However, some
    of the company’s subsidiaries may be subject to federal and
    state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject
    to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is
    required to be estimated on the company’s taxable income
    arising from its taxable real estate investment trust
    subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax
    component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus
    tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition.
    The company is required to establish a valuation allowance for
    deferred tax assets if it is determined, based on available
    evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. The company concluded, based on a
    review of the relative weight of the available evidence, that it
    was more likely than not that it would not generate sufficient
    future taxable income to realize certain deferred tax assets.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and
    Translation.

Transactions that require the
    remeasurement and translation of a foreign currency are recorded
    according to accounting guidance on foreign currency
    translation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for
    the company’s subsidiaries formed in the United States,
    Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. Other than Mexico and
    certain subsidiaries in Europe, the functional currency for the
    company’s subsidiaries operating outside the United States
    is generally the local currency of the country in which the
    entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of currency
    exchange gains and losses. The company’s subsidiaries whose
    functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their
    financial statements into U.S. dollars.



Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in
    effect as of the financial statement date. The company
    translates income statement accounts using the average exchange
    rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions
    using the rate on the transaction date.

The company’s international subsidiaries may have
    transactions denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currencies. In these instances, non-monetary assets
    and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate,
    monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange
    rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement
    accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the
    period. The company also records gains or losses in the income
    statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in
    a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is
    settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more
    or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect
    when the transaction was initiated.

CONSOLIDATED
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store
    growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. The
    same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the
    end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and
    excludes development properties stabilized after
    December 31, 2007 (generally defined as properties that are
    90% occupied). As of December 31, 2009, the same store
    industrial pool consisted of properties aggregating
    approximately 63.8 million square feet. The company’s
    future financial condition and results of operations, including
    rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition and
    disposition of additional properties, and expenses may vary
    materially from historical results. Acquisition and development
    property divestiture activity for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:

Same store rental revenues decreased $59.7 million from the
    prior year due primarily to the contribution of AMB Partners II,
    L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated
    co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store rental
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have
    been $494.6 million if the interests in AMB Partners II,
    L.P. had been contributed as of January 1, 2008, rather
    than July 1, 2008. The decrease of $20.8 million,
    excluding the effect of the contribution of interests in AMB
    Partners II, L.P., was primarily due to decreased occupancy
    during 2009. The increase in revenues from prior year
    acquisitions is due to revenues recognized for the full year
    ended December 31, 2009 for properties acquired throughout
    all of 2008. The increase in rental revenues from development of
    $29.1 million is



primarily due to increased occupancy at several of the
    company’s development projects. Other industrial revenues
    include rental revenues from development projects that have
    reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of the
    same store operating pool of properties. The decrease in these
    revenues of $7.0 million primarily reflects a decline in
    occupancy in 2009. The decrease in private capital revenues of
    $30.6 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive
    and acquisition fees recognized in 2009 from fees recognized in
    the prior year. In 2009, the company recognized incentive
    distributions of $2.9 million for AMB DFS Fund I, LLC,
    and in 2008, the company received incentive distributions of
    $33.0 million for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P. and $1.0 million in connection with the sale of the
    partnership interests in AMB/Erie, L.P., including its final
    real estate asset to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P.

Same store properties’ operating expenses decreased
    $6.0 million from the prior year primarily due to the
    contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a
    consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment
    venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store operating expenses for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been
    $139.7 million if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P.
    had been contributed as of January 1, 2008, rather than
    July 1, 2008. The increase of $3.9 million, excluding
    the effect of the contribution of interests in AMB Partners II,
    L.P., was primarily due to an increase in common area
    maintenance expenses and ground rent expense. The increase in
    expenses of $4.7 million related to properties acquired in
    2008 is due to the recognition of expenses for the full year
    ended December 31, 2009 for properties acquired throughout
    all of 2008. The increase in development operating costs of
    $13.6 million was primarily due to an increase in
    utilities, repairs and maintenance expenses and ground rent
    expenses due to higher occupancy in certain development
    projects. The decrease in other industrial operating costs of
    $2.7 million was primarily due to the disposition of
    industrial operating properties during 2009. The increase in
    depreciation and amortization expenses of $15.7 million is
    primarily due to $15.5 million additional depreciation
    expense recorded upon reclassification of assets from properties
    held for contribution to investments in real estate in 2009 and
    asset stabilizations, partially offset by the full depreciation
    expense taken on an asset demolition in the third quarter of
    2008. The decrease in general and administrative expenses of
    $28.7 million is primarily due to a personnel and cost
    reduction plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. During
    the year ended December 31, 2009, the company recorded
    $6.4 million in restructuring charges, as compared to
    $12.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, due
    to the further implementation of the cost reduction plan, which
    included a reduction in global headcount, office closure costs
    and



the termination of certain contractual obligations. See
    Item 15: Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the
    real estate impairment losses recorded in the company’s
    results of operations during 2009 and 2008. Other expenses
    increased $9.7 million primarily as a result of an increase
    in the company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan
    expenses of $15.7 million, partially offset by a decrease
    in dead deal costs of $5.8 million from prior year.

Development profits represent gains from the sale or
    contribution of development projects, including land. See the
    development sales and development contributions tables and
    “Development Sales and Contributions” in “Capital
    Resources of the Operating Partnership” for a discussion of
    the development asset sales and contributions and the associated
    development profits during the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    company did not contribute any industrial operating properties
    to unconsolidated co-investment ventures. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the company contributed one industrial
    operating property for approximately $66.2 million,
    aggregating approximately 0.8 million square feet, into AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. As a result, the
    company recognized a gain of $20.0 million on the
    contribution, representing the portion of the company’s
    interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party
    investors for cash.

The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint
    ventures of $5.8 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 was
    primarily due to lower occupancy in 2009 and impairment losses
    recognized on the company’s unconsolidated assets under
    management, partially offset by the contribution of AMB Partners
    II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to
    AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an
    unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008.
    Other income increased $9.4 million from the prior year
    primarily due to a $15.7 million increase in gains related
    to the company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan,
    partially offset by a decrease in bank interest income of
    $4.7 million due to lower cash balances and interest rates
    and an increase in foreign currency exchange rate losses. During
    the year ended December 31, 2009, the company recognized a
    loss on currency remeasurement of approximately
    $7.2 million, compared to a loss of approximately
    $5.7 million in the same period of 2008. Interest expense
    decreased $12.6 million primarily due to decreased
    borrowings as well as a decrease in interest rates. Loss on
    early extinguishment of debt increased by $11.5 million
    primarily due to early repayments of secured debt and the
    completion of the repurchase of bonds in connection with the
    company’s tender offers in 2009.

The increase in income attributable to discontinued operations
    of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 was
    primarily due to a decrease in real estate impairment losses on
    properties sold in 2009 or held for sale as of December 31,
    2009. During the year ended December 31,



2009, the company sold value-added conversion development
    projects and land parcels aggregating approximately
    0.2 million square for a sale price of $143.9 million,
    with a resulting net gain of $53.0 million. During the year
    ended December 31, 2009, the company sold industrial
    operating properties aggregating approximately 2.3 million
    square feet for a sale price of $151.6 million, with a
    resulting gain of $37.2 million. Additionally, during the
    year ended December 31, 2009, the company recognized a
    deferred gain of $1.6 million on the sale of industrial
    operating properties, aggregating approximately 0.1 million
    square feet, for a price of $17.5 million, which was
    deferred as part of the contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. to
    AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. in July 2008.
    During the year ended December 31, 2008, the company sold
    approximately 0.1 million square feet of industrial
    operating properties for a sale price of $3.6 million, with
    a resulting gain of $1.0 million, and the company
    recognized a deferred gain of approximately $1.4 million on
    the sale of industrial operating properties, aggregating
    approximately 0.1 million square feet, for an aggregate
    price of $3.5 million, which were disposed of on
    December 31, 2007.

Same store rental revenues decreased $21.5 million from the
    prior year due primarily to the contribution of AMB Partners II,
    L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated
    co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store rental
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have
    been $573.3 million if the interests in AMB Partners II,
    L.P. had not been contributed as of December 31, 2008. The
    increase of $18.3 million, excluding the effect of the
    contribution of interests in AMB Partners II, L.P., was
    primarily due to increased rental rates and decreases in free
    rent. The increase in rental revenues from development of
    $14.5 million is primarily due to increased occupancy at
    several of the company’s development projects. Other
    industrial revenues include rental revenues from development
    projects that have reached certain levels of operation but are
    not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The
    increase in these revenues of $1.9 million primarily
    reflects the number of projects that have reached these levels
    of operation and higher rent levels during 2008. The increase in
    private capital revenues of $36.8 million was primarily due
    to the receipt of an incentive distribution of
    $33.0 million for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III,
    L.P., an



incentive distribution of $1.0 million in connection with
    the sale of the partnership interests in AMB/Erie, L.P.,
    including its final real estate asset to AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., and an increase in asset
    management fees as a result of an increase in total
    unconsolidated assets under management, partially offset by a
    decrease in acquisition fees.

Same store properties’ operating expenses decreased
    $5.7 million from the prior year primarily due to the
    contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a
    consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment
    venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store operating expenses for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been
    $159.9 million if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P.
    had not been contributed as of December 31, 2008. The
    increase of $4.6 million, excluding the effect of the
    contribution of interests in AMB Partners II, L.P., was
    primarily due to increased real estate taxes, utilities, repairs
    and maintenance expenses, ground rent expenses and
    non-reimbursable expenses. The increase in development operating
    costs of $4.8 million was primarily due to an increase in
    real estate taxes as well as increased utilities, repairs and
    maintenance expenses and ground rent expenses due to higher
    occupancy in certain development projects. Other industrial
    expenses include expenses from divested properties that have
    been contributed to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which
    are not classified as discontinued operations in our
    consolidated financial statements, and development properties
    that have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet
    part of the same store operating pool of properties. The
    increase in other industrial operating costs of
    $8.1 million was primarily due to an increase in the number
    of properties that have reached these levels of operations. The
    increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of
    $6.9 million was primarily due to the recognition of
    $4.3 million of depreciation expense resulting from the
    reclassification of $76.7 million from properties held for
    contribution to investments in real estate in 2008 and asset
    stabilizations, as well as the full depreciation expense taken
    on an asset demolition in the third quarter of 2008. The
    increase in general and administrative expenses of
    $14.5 million was primarily due to an increase in personnel
    costs, resulting from increased employee headcount in the first
    three quarters of 2008 as well as an increase in professional
    services, and taxes. During the year ended December 31,
    2008, the company recorded $12.3 million in restructuring
    charges due to the implementation of a broad-based cost
    reduction plan, which included a reduction in global headcount,
    office closure costs and the termination of certain contractual
    obligations. The increase in real estate impairment losses was
    primarily a result of changes in the economic environment in
    addition to the write-off of pursuit costs. See Item 15:
    Note 3 of the “Notes to



Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed
    discussion of the real estate impairment losses recorded in the
    company’s results of operations during the fourth quarter
    of 2008. The decrease in other expenses of $4.6 million was
    primarily due to a loss on our non-qualified deferred
    compensation plans during the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to a gain during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Development profits represent gains from the sale or
    contribution of development projects including land. See the
    development sales and development contributions tables and
    “Development Sales and Contributions” in “Capital
    Resources of the Operating Partnership” for a discussion of
    the development asset sales and contributions and the associated
    development profits during the years ended December 31,
    2008 and 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    company contributed one industrial operating property for
    approximately $66.2 million, aggregating approximately
    0.8 million square feet, into AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. As a result, the company recognized a gain
    of $20.0 million on the contribution, representing the
    portion of its interest in the contributed property acquired by
    the third-party investors for cash. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the company contributed 4.2 million
    square feet in industrial operating properties into AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, contributed one 0.2 million square
    foot industrial operating property into AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., and contributed one industrial
    operating property aggregating approximately 0.1 million
    square feet into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, for a total of
    approximately $524.9 million. As a result of these
    contributions, the company recognized gains from the
    contribution of real estate interests of approximately
    $73.4 million, representing the portion of its interest in
    the contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors
    for cash.

The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint
    ventures of $9.6 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was primarily due to the contribution of
    the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a
    consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment
    venture, as well as growth in the company’s unconsolidated
    assets under management. Other income (expenses) decreased
    $25.4 million from the prior year primarily due to foreign
    currency exchange rate loss, a loss on the company’s
    nonqualified deferred compensation plan of $7.8 million,
    the recognition of a $5.5 million loss on impairment of an
    investment and a decrease in interest income of approximately
    $3.3 million, partially offset by an increase in third
    party management fees. During the year ended December 31,
    2007, the company recognized a gain on currency remeasurement of
    approximately $3.9 million, compared to a loss of
    approximately $5.7 million in 2008. Additionally, other
    income during the year ended December 31, 2007 included
    insurance proceeds of approximately $2.9 million related to
    losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Interest expense
    increased $7.2 million as a result of increased total
    consolidated debt at December 31, 2008.

The decrease in income attributable to discontinued operations
    of $17.2 million for 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily
    due to $10.2 million of real estate impairment losses on
    assets sold in 2008 and held for sale as of December 31,
    2008, as well as a decrease in sales and contributions of
    industrial operating properties in 2008. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the company sold approximately
    0.1 million square feet of industrial operating properties
    for a sale price of $3.6 million, with a resulting gain of
    $1.0 million, and the company recognized a deferred gain of
    approximately $1.4 million on the sale of industrial
    operating properties, aggregating approximately 0.1 million
    square feet, for an aggregate price of $3.5 million, which
    were disposed of on December 31, 2007. No value-added
    conversion projects were sold during 2008. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the company sold industrial operating
    properties, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square
    feet, for an aggregate price of $16.3 million, with a
    resulting gain of $12.1 million, and value-added conversion
    projects for an aggregate price of $88.0 million, resulting
    in a gain of approximately $52.1 million.

On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all
    800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% series J cumulative
    redeemable preferred limited partnership units and all 800,000
    of its outstanding 7.95% series K cumulative redeemable
    preferred limited partnership units. In addition, AMB Property
    II, L.P., one of the operating partnership’s subsidiaries,
    repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00% series I
    cumulative redeemable preferred limited partnership units. As a
    result of the redemptions and repurchase, the company recognized
    a reduction of income available to common stockholders of
    $2.9 million for the original issuance costs during the
    year ended December 31, 2007. No repurchases of units were
    made during the year ended December 31, 2008.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE PARENT COMPANY

In this “Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Parent
    Company” section, the “parent company” refers
    only to AMB Property Corporation and not to any of its
    subsidiaries.

The parent company’s business is operated primarily through
    the operating partnership. The parent company issues public
    equity from time to time, but does not otherwise conduct any
    business or generate any capital itself. The parent company
    itself does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material
    asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating
    partnership. The parent company’s principal funding
    requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and
    preferred stock. The parent company’s principal source of
    funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives
    from the operating partnership.

As of December 31, 2009, the parent company owned an
    approximate 97.8% general partnership interest in the operating
    partnership, excluding preferred units. The remaining
    approximate 2.2% common limited partnership interests are owned
    by non-affiliated investors and certain current and former
    directors and officers of the parent company. As of
    December 31, 2009, the parent company owned all of the
    preferred limited partnership units of the operating
    partnership. As the sole general partner of the operating
    partnership, the parent company has the full, exclusive and
    complete responsibility for the operating partnership’s

day-to-day

management and control. The parent company causes the operating
    partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the parent
    company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash
    in the manner provided in the operating partnership’s
    partnership agreement. Generally, if distributions are made,
    distributions are paid in the following order of priority:
    first, to satisfy any prior distribution shortfall to the parent
    company as the holder of preferred units; second, to the parent
    company as the holder of preferred units; and third, to the
    holders of common units of the operating partnership, including
    the parent company, in accordance with the rights of each such
    class.

As general partner with control of the operating partnership,
    the parent company consolidates the operating partnership for
    financial reporting purposes, and the parent company does not
    have significant assets other than its



investment in the operating partnership. Therefore, the assets
    and liabilities of the parent company and the operating
    partnership are the same on their respective financial
    statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at
    the operating partnership level, and the parent company has
    guaranteed some of the operating partnership’s secured and
    unsecured debt as discussed below. As the parent company
    consolidates the operating partnership, the section entitled
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating
    Partnership” should be read in conjunction with this
    section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the
    company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated
    as a whole.

Capital
    Resources of the Parent Company

Distributions from the operating partnership are the parent
    company’s principal source of capital. The parent company
    receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but
    is required by the operating partnership’s partnership
    agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances
    to the operating partnership in exchange for partnership units
    of the operating partnership.

As circumstances warrant, the parent company may issue equity
    from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon
    market conditions and available pricing. The operating
    partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including
    borrowings under its lines of credit, to make acquisitions of
    properties, portfolios of properties or U.S. or foreign
    property-owning or real estate-related entities, to invest in
    existing or newly created co-investment ventures or for general
    corporate purposes.

Common and Preferred Equity

The parent company
    has authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred
    stock, of which the following series were designated as of
    December 31, 2009: 2,300,000 shares of series L
    cumulative redeemable preferred stock, of which 2,000,000 are
    outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative
    redeemable preferred stock, all of which are outstanding;
    3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable
    preferred stock, all of which are outstanding; and
    2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable
    preferred stock, all of which are outstanding.

On November 10, 2009, the parent company purchased all
    1,595,337 outstanding series D preferred units of AMB
    Property II, L.P. in exchange for 2,880,281 shares of its
    common stock at a discount of $9.8 million and contributed
    the series D preferred units to the operating partnership.
    The operating partnership issued 2,880,281 general partnership
    units to the parent company in exchange for the 1,595,337
    series D preferred units the parent company purchased.

In December 2007, the parent company’s board of directors
    approved a two-year common stock repurchase program for the
    repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the parent
    company’s common stock, which terminated on
    December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, the parent company did not repurchase any shares of its
    common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    parent company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares
    of its common stock for an aggregate price of $87.7 million
    at a weighted average price of $49.64 per share. During the year
    ended December 31, 2007, the parent company repurchased
    approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock for an
    aggregate price of $53.4 million at a weighted average
    price of $49.87 per share.

In March 2009, the parent company completed the issuance of
    47.4 million shares of its common stock at a price of
    $12.15 per share for proceeds of approximately
    $552.3 million, net of discounts, commissions and estimated
    transaction expenses of approximately $23.8 million. The
    proceeds from the offering were contributed to the operating
    partnership in exchange for the issuance of 47.4 million
    general partnership units to the parent company.

Noncontrolling interests in the parent company represent the
    common limited partnership interests in the operating
    partnership, limited partnership interests in AMB Property II,
    L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and interests held by
    third-party partners in joint ventures. Such joint ventures held
    approximately 21.0 million square feet as of
    December 31, 2009, and are consolidated for financial
    reporting purposes.

Please see “Explanatory Note” on page 1 and
    Part IV, Item 15: Note 11 of the “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of the
    noncontrolling interests of the parent company.

In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the
    deployment of capital through market cycles, the parent company
    presently intends over the long term to operate with a parent
    company’s share of total

debt-to-parent

company’s share of total market capitalization ratio or
    parent company’s share of total

debt-to-parent

company’s share of total assets of approximately 45% or
    less. In order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long
    term, the parent company is currently exploring various options
    to monetize its development assets through possible contribution
    to funds where capacity is available, the formation of joint
    ventures and the sale to third parties. It is also exploring the
    potential sale of industrial operating assets to further enhance
    liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, the parent
    company’s share of total

debt-to-parent

company’s share of total assets ratio was 43.6%. (See
    footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for the
    definitions of “parent company’s share of total market
    capitalization,” “market equity,” “parent
    company’s share of total debt” and “parent
    company’s share of total assets.”) The parent company
    typically finances its co-investment ventures with secured debt
    at a

loan-to-value

ratio of

50-65%

pursuant to its co-investment venture agreements. Additionally,
    the operating partnership currently intends to manage its
    capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating
    on its senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies,
    however, the parent company’s and operating
    partnership’s organizational documents do not limit the
    amount of indebtedness that either entity may incur.
    Accordingly, management could alter or eliminate these policies
    without stockholder or unitholder approval or circumstances
    could arise that could render the parent company or the
    operating partnership unable to comply with these policies. For
    example, decreases in the market



price of the parent company’s common stock have caused an
    increase in the ratio of parent company’s share of total

debt-to-parent

company’s share of total market capitalization.

Although the parent company does not hold any indebtedness
    itself, the parent company’s total debt reflects the
    consolidation of the operating partnership’s total debt for
    financial reporting purposes. The parent company’s
    definition of “total market capitalization” for the
    parent company is total debt plus preferred equity liquidation
    preferences plus market equity. The definition of “parent
    company’s share of total market capitalization” is the
    parent company’s share of total debt plus preferred equity
    liquidation preferences plus market equity. The definition of
    “market equity” is the total number of outstanding
    shares of common stock of the parent company and common limited
    partnership units of the operating partnership and AMB Property
    II, L.P. multiplied by the closing price per share of the parent
    company’s common stock as of December 31, 2009. The
    definition of “preferred” is preferred equity
    liquidation preferences. “Parent company’s share of
    total book capitalization” is defined as the parent
    company’s share of total debt plus noncontrolling interests
    to preferred unitholders and limited partnership unitholders
    plus stockholders’ equity. “Parent company’s
    share of total debt” is the parent company’s pro rata
    portion of the total debt based on the parent company’s
    percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated and
    unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. “Parent
    company’s share of total assets” is the parent
    company’s pro rata portion of the gross book value of real
    estate interests plus cash and other assets. The parent company
    believes that share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental
    measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze
    the parent company’s leverage and to compare the parent
    company’s leverage to that of other companies. In addition,
    it allows for a more meaningful comparison of the parent
    company’s debt to that of other companies that do not
    consolidate their joint ventures. Parent company’s share of
    total debt is not intended to reflect the parent company’s
    actual liability should there be a default under any or all of
    such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a
    reconciliation of parent company’s share of total debt to
    total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see
    the table of debt maturities and capitalization in the section
    below entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources of AMB
    Property, L.P.”

Liquidity
    of the Parent Company

The liquidity of the parent company is dependent on the
    operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient
    distributions to the parent company. The primary cash
    requirement of the parent company is its payment of dividends to
    its stockholders. The parent company also guarantees some of the
    operating partnership’s secured and unsecured debt
    described in the “Debt Guarantees” section below. If
    the operating partnership fails to fulfill its debt
    requirements, which trigger parent guarantee obligations, then
    the parent company will be required to fulfill its cash payment
    commitments under such guarantees.

The parent company believes the operating partnership’s
    sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from
    operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit
    facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution
    payments to the parent company and, in turn, for the parent
    company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders.
    However, there can be no assurance that the operating
    partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be
    available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs,
    including its ability to make distribution payments to the
    parent company. The unavailability of capital could adversely
    affect the operating partnership’s ability to pay its
    distributions to the parent company, which will, in turn,
    adversely affect the parent company’s ability to pay cash
    dividends to its stockholders and the market price of the parent
    company’s stock.

Should the parent company face a situation in which the
    operating partnership does not have sufficient cash available
    through its operations to continue operating its business as
    usual (including making its distributions to the parent
    company), the operating partnership may need to find alternative
    ways to increase the operating partnership’s



liquidity. Such alternatives, which would be done through the
    operating partnership, may include, without limitation,
    divesting itself of properties and decreasing the operating
    partnership’s cash distribution to the parent company.
    Other alternatives are for the parent company to pay some or all
    of its dividends in stock rather than cash or issuing its equity
    in public or private transactions whether or not at favorable
    pricing or on favorable terms.

If the operating partnership is unable to obtain new financing
    or refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay
    them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then its
    cash flow may be insufficient to pay its distributions to the
    parent company, which will have, as a result, insufficient funds
    to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders.
    Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at
    the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to
    make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest
    rates upon refinancing, then the operating partnership’s
    interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would
    increase. This increased interest expense of the operating
    partnership would adversely affect the parent company’s
    ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market
    price of its stock.

The operating partnership may, from time to time, seek to retire
    or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases

and/or

exchanges for the parent company’s equity securities in
    open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or
    otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on
    prevailing market conditions, the parent company’s
    liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other
    factors. The amounts involved may be material.

For the parent company to maintain its qualification as a real
    estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its
    stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable
    income. While historically the parent company has satisfied this
    distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its
    stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by
    making distributions of cash or other property, including, in
    limited circumstances, the parent company’s own stock. As a
    result of this distribution requirement, the operating
    partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its
    on-going operations to the same extent that other companies
    whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts
    can. The parent company may need to continue to raise capital in
    the equity markets to fund the operating partnership’s
    working capital needs, acquisitions and developments.

As circumstances warrant, the parent company may issue equity
    securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis,
    dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The
    parent company would contribute any such proceeds to the
    operating partnership, which would then use the proceeds to
    repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, to
    make acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or
    U.S. or foreign property-owning or real estate-related
    entities or for general corporate purposes.

The parent company anticipates that the operating partnership
    will be required to use proceeds from debt and equity financings
    (including the issuance of equity by the parent company) and the
    divestiture of properties, in addition to cash from its
    operations, to make its distribution payments and repay its
    maturing debt as it comes due. However, the parent company and
    the operating partnership may not be able to issue such
    securities on favorable terms or at all. The parent
    company’s or the operating partnership’s inability to
    issue securities on favorable terms or at all would adversely
    affect the operating partnership’s financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flow and its ability to pay
    distributions to the parent company, which will, in turn,
    adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s
    stock and the parent company’s ability to pay cash
    dividends to its stockholders.



Cash flows generated by the operating partnership were
    sufficient to cover the operating partnership’s
    distributions for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007, including its distributions to the parent company,
    which were, in turn, paid to the parent company’s
    stockholders as dividends. Cash flows from the operating
    partnership’s real estate operations and private capital
    businesses, which are included in “Net cash provided by
    operating activities” in the parent company’s Cash
    Flows from Operating Activities and cash flows from the
    operating partnership’s real estate development and
    operations businesses which are included in “Net proceeds
    from divestiture of real estate” in the parent
    company’s Cash Flows from Investing Activities in its
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were sufficient to pay
    dividends on the parent company’s common stock and
    preferred stock, distributions on common and preferred limited
    partnership units of the operating partnership and AMB Property
    II, L.P. and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. For the year
    ended December 31, 2007, Cash Flows from Operating
    Activities alone were not sufficient to pay such dividends and
    distributions, as shown in the table below. The parent company
    uses proceeds from the operating partnership included in Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities (specifically, the proceeds from
    sales and contributions of properties as part of its real estate
    development and operations businesses) to fund dividends and
    distributions not covered by Cash Flows from Operating
    Activities, if any.

The following table sets forth the summary of the parent
    company’s dividends and the operating partnership’s
    distributions paid or payable for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

Debt guarantees.

The parent company is the
    guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations with
    respect to its unsecured senior debt securities. As of
    December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.2 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 6.4% and had an average term of 6.1 years. In May
    2008, the operating partnership sold $325.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes under
    its Series C medium-term note program. The indenture for
    the senior debt securities contains limitation on mergers or
    consolidations of the parent company.

The parent company guarantees the operating partnership’s
    obligations with respect to $425.0 million of its other
    debt, related to the following loan facility. In October 2009,
    the operating partnership refinanced its $325.0 million
    senior unsecured term loan facility, which was set to mature in
    September 2010, with a $345.0 million multi-currency
    facility, maturing October 2012. In December 2009, the operating
    partnership exercised its option and increased the facility to
    $425.0 million, in accordance with the terms set forth in
    the credit facility. The facility includes Euro and Yen
    tranches, with both the multi-currency and the U.S. dollar
    components currently priced at 275 basis points over the
    applicable LIBOR index. This facility contains limitations on
    the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or
    consolidations of the parent company.

The parent company is a guarantor of the operating
    partnership’s obligations under its $550.0 million
    (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or
    U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving
    credit facility,



which, as of December 31, 2009, had a balance of
    $55.5 million using the exchange rate in effect at
    December 31, 2009 and bore a weighted average interest rate
    of 0.68%.

The parent company, along with the operating partnership,
    guarantees the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a
    subsidiary of the operating partnership, under its credit
    facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in
    which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an
    ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be
    a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. This
    credit facility has an initial borrowing limit of
    55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect
    at December 31, 2009, equaled approximately
    $591.3 million U.S. dollars. As of December 31,
    2009, this facility had a balance of $182.9 million using
    the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2009 and bore a
    weighted average interest rate of 0.7%.

The parent company and the operating partnership guarantee the
    obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled
    by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating
    partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant
    to a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility.
    The operating partnership and certain of its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, each acting as a borrower, with the parent company
    and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into this
    credit facility, which has an option to further increase the
    facility to $750.0 million, to extend the maturity date to
    July 2011 and to allow for future borrowing in Indian rupees. As
    of December 31, 2009, this facility had a balance of
    $239.2 million using the exchange rate in effect at
    December 31, 2009 and bore a weighted average interest rate
    of 0.89%.

The credit agreements related to the above facilities contain
    limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on
    mergers or consolidations of the parent company.

Potential Contingent and Unknown
    Liabilities.

Contingent and unknown liabilities
    may include claims for indemnification by officers and directors
    and tax, legal and regulatory liabilities.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

Balance Sheet Strategy.

In general, the
    operating partnership uses unsecured lines of credit, unsecured
    notes, common and preferred equity (issued by the parent
    company, the operating partnership and their subsidiaries, as
    applicable) to capitalize its wholly owned assets. Over time,
    the operating partnership plans to retire non-recourse, secured
    debt encumbering its wholly owned assets and replace that debt
    with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing the
    co-investment ventures, in general, the operating partnership
    uses non-recourse, secured debt to capitalize its co-investment
    ventures.

The operating partnership currently expects that its principal
    sources of working capital and funding for debt service,
    development, acquisitions, expansion and renovation of
    properties will include:

•

cash on hand and cash flow from operations;

•

borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities;

•

other forms of secured or unsecured financing;

•

assumption of debt related to acquired properties;

•

proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including
    issuances of limited partnership units by the operating
    partnership’s subsidiaries);

•

proceeds from debt securities offerings by the operating
    partnership;

•

proceeds from equity offerings by the parent company;

•

net proceeds from divestitures of properties;

•

private capital from co-investment partners;

•

net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed
    development projects to its co-investment ventures; and



•

net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value-added
    conversion projects and land to third parties.

The operating partnership currently expects that its principal
    funding requirements will include:

•

debt service;

•

distributions on outstanding common, preferred and general
    partnership units;

•

working capital;

•

acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties, interests
    in real-estate related entities or platforms; and

•

development, expansion and renovation of properties.

Capital
    Resources of the Operating Partnership

The operating partnership believes its sources of working
    capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and
    borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are
    adequate for it to meet its current liquidity requirements.
    However, there can be no assurance that the operating
    partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be
    available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs. The
    unavailability of capital could adversely affect the operating
    partnership’s financial condition, results of operations,
    cash flow and the ability to pay cash distributions to its
    unitholders and make payments to its noteholders.

For the parent company to maintain its qualification as a real
    estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its
    stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable
    income. As a result of this distribution requirement, the
    operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund
    its on-going operations to the same extent that other
    corporations whose parent companies are not real estate
    investment trusts can. The operating partnership may need to
    continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to
    fund its working capital needs, acquisitions and developments.

Cash Flows.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities
    was $242.3 million as compared to $301.0 million for
    the same period in 2008. This change is primarily due to lower
    net operating income in 2009 as well as changes in the operating
    partnership’s accounts receivable and other assets and
    accounts payable and other liabilities. Cash provided by
    investing activities was $75.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, as compared to cash used in investing
    activities of $881.8 million for the same period in 2008.
    This change is primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from
    divestiture of real estate and securities and decreases in the
    following: cash paid for property acquisitions, additions to
    land, buildings, development costs, building improvements and
    lease costs, loans made to affiliated entities and the purchase
    of equity interests. This is partially offset by the decrease in
    repayment of mortgage and loan receivables. Cash used in
    financing activities was $288.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, as compared to cash provided by
    financing activities of $581.8 million for the same period
    in 2008. This change is due primarily to a decrease in net
    borrowings on secured debt, other debt and unsecured credit
    facilities and an increase in payments on senior debt. This
    activity was partially offset by an increase in net proceeds
    from issuances of senior debt, an increase in the issuance of
    common and preferred units, a decrease in the repurchase of
    common units, and a decrease in distributions paid to common and
    preferred unitholders and noncontrolling interests.

Partners’ Capital.

As of
    December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had
    outstanding 149,028,965 common general partnership units;
    2,119,928 common limited partnership units; 2,000,000 6.50%
    series L cumulative redeemable preferred units; 2,300,000
    6.75% series M cumulative redeemable preferred units;
    3,000,000 7.00% series O cumulative redeemable preferred
    units; and 2,000,000 6.85% series P cumulative redeemable
    preferred units.

On November 10, 2009, the parent company purchased all
    1,595,337 outstanding series D preferred units of AMB
    Property II, L.P. in exchange for 2,880,281 shares of its
    common stock at a discount of $9.8 million and contributed
    the series D preferred units to the operating partnership.
    The operating partnership issued 2,880,281 general partnership
    units to the parent company in exchange for the 1,595,337
    series D preferred units the parent company purchased.



The net proceeds from the parent company’s March 2009
    offering of 47.4 million shares of common stock were
    contributed to the operating partnership in exchange for the
    issuance of 47.4 million general partnership units to the
    parent company. The operating partnership used the proceeds from
    the offering to reduce borrowings under its unsecured credit
    facilities. The proceeds were approximately $552.3 million,
    net of discounts, commissions and estimated transaction expenses
    of approximately $23.8 million.

Development Completions.

Development
    completions are generally defined as properties that are 90%
    occupied or pre-leased, or that have been substantially complete
    for at least 12 months. Development completions on a
    consolidated basis during the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

    Net.

During the year ended December 31,
    2009, the operating partnership did not contribute any
    industrial operating properties to unconsolidated co-investment
    ventures. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the

    property for approximately $66.2 million, aggregating
    approximately 0.8 million square feet, to AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P. Also during 2008, the operating

    consolidated statements of operations.

Properties Held for Sale or Contribution,
    Net.

As of December 31, 2009, the operating
    partnership held for sale three properties with an aggregate net
    book value of $13.9 million. These properties either are
    not in the operating partnership’s core markets, do not
    meet its current investment objectives, or are included as part
    of its

development-for-sale

or value-added conversion programs. The sales of the properties
    are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other
    customary conditions. Properties held for sale are stated at the
    lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of
    December 31, 2008, the operating partnership held for sale
    two properties with an aggregate net book value of
    $8.2 million.

As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership held for
    contribution to co-investment ventures 11 properties with an
    aggregate net book value of $200.5 million, which, when
    contributed, will reduce its average ownership interest in these
    projects from approximately 96% to an expected range of

15-20%.

As
    of December 31, 2008, the operating partnership held for
    contribution to co-investment ventures 20 properties with an
    aggregate net book value of $600.8 million.

As of December 31, 2009, no properties were reclassified
    from held for sale and properties with an aggregate net book
    value of $143.9 million were reclassified from held for
    contribution to investments in real estate as a result of the
    change in management’s intent to hold these assets. These
    properties may be reclassified as properties held for sale or
    held for contribution at some future time. In accordance with
    the operating partnership’s policies of accounting for the
    impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, during the year
    December 31, 2009, the operating partnership recognized
    additional depreciation expense from the reclassification of
    assets from properties held for sale and contribution to
    investments in real estate and related accumulated depreciation
    of $15.5 million, as well as impairment charges of
    $55.8 million on real estate assets held for sale or
    contribution for which it was determined that the carrying value
    was greater than the estimated fair value. As of
    December 31, 2008, properties with an aggregate net book
    value of $100.4 million were reclassified from properties
    held for contribution to investments in real estate as a result
    of the change in management’s intent to hold these assets.
    These properties may be reclassified as properties held for sale
    or held for contribution at some future time. In accordance with
    the operating partnership’s policies of accounting for the
    impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, during the year
    ended December 31, 2008, the operating partnership
    recognized additional depreciation expense and related
    accumulated depreciation of $2.2 million as a result of the
    reclassification, as well as impairment charges of
    $21.8 million on real estate assets held for divestiture or
    contribution for which it was determined that the carrying value
    was greater than the estimated fair value.

Gains from Sale of Real Estate Interests, Net of
    Taxes.

During the year ended December 31,
    2009, the operating partnership sold industrial operating
    properties aggregating approximately 2.3 million square
    feet for a sale price of $151.6 million, with a resulting
    gain of $37.2 million. Additionally, during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the operating partnership recognized a
    deferred gain of $1.6 million on the divestiture of
    industrial operating properties, aggregating approximately

    July 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    operating partnership sold approximately 0.1 million square
    feet of industrial operating properties for a sale price of
    $3.6 million, with a resulting gain of $1.0 million,
    and it recognized a deferred gain of approximately
    $1.4 million on the sale of industrial operating
    properties, aggregating approximately 0.1 million square
    feet, for an aggregate price of $3.5 million, which were
    disposed of on December 31, 2007. During 2007, the
    operating partnership sold industrial operating properties,
    aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an
    aggregate price of $16.3 million, with a resulting gain of
    approximately $12.1 million. These gains are presented in
    gains from sale of real estate interests, net of taxes, as
    discontinued operations in the statements of operations.

Value-added Conversion Sales.

During the year
    ended December 31, 2009, the operating partnership sold
    value-added conversion projects, including approximately
    0.2 million square feet and 21 land acres, for an
    aggregate price of $143.9 million, with a resulting gain of
    approximately $53.0 million. No value-added conversion
    projects were sold during 2008. During 2007, the operating
    partnership sold value-added conversion projects, aggregating
    approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate
    price of $88.0 million, with a resulting gain of



approximately $52.1 million. These gains are presented in
    development profits, net of taxes, as discontinued operations in
    the consolidated statements of operations.

Co-investment Ventures.

The operating
    partnership enters into co-investment ventures with
    institutional investors, which are managed by the operating
    partnership’s private capital group and provide it with an
    additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions,
    development projects and renovation projects, as well as private
    capital income. The operating partnership holds interests in
    both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.

Third-party equity interests in the consolidated co-investment
    ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the
    consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009,
    the operating partnership owned approximately 77.4 million
    square feet of its properties (49.9% of the total operating and
    development portfolio) through its consolidated and
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures. The operating partnership
    may make additional investments through these co-investment
    ventures or new co-investment ventures in the future and
    presently plans to do so.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the operating partnership
    also had a 100% consolidated interest in G. Accion, a Mexican
    real estate company, which has been renamed AMB Property Mexico,
    S.A. de C.V. (“AMB



Property Mexico”). AMB Property Mexico owns and develops
    real estate and provides real estate management and development
    services in Mexico. On June 13, 2008, the operating
    partnership acquired approximately 19% of additional equity
    interest and on July 18, 2008, it acquired the remaining
    equity interest (approximately 42%) in AMB Property Mexico,
    increasing its equity interest from approximately 39% to 100%.
    Through its investment in AMB Property Mexico, the operating
    partnership held equity interests in various other
    unconsolidated ventures totaling approximately
    $18.7 million and $24.6 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Debt.

In order to maintain financial
    flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through
    market cycles, the operating partnership presently intends over
    the long term to operate with an operating partnership’s
    share of total

debt-to-operating

partnership’s share of total market capitalization ratio or
    operating partnership’s share of total

debt-to-operating

partnership’s share of total assets of approximately 45% or
    less. In order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long
    term, the operating partnership is currently exploring various
    options to monetize its development assets through possible
    contribution to funds where capacity is available, the formation
    of joint ventures and the sale to third parties. The operating
    partnership is also exploring the potential sale of operating
    assets to further enhance liquidity. As of December 31,
    2009, the operating partnership’s share of total

debt-to-operating

partnership’s share of total assets ratio was 43.6%. (See
    footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for the
    definitions of “operating partnership’s share of total
    market capitalization,” “market equity,”
    “operating partnership’s share of total debt” and
    “operating partnership’s share of total assets.”)
    The operating partnership typically finances its co-investment
    ventures with secured debt at a

loan-to-value

ratio of

50-65%

per
    its co-investment venture agreements. Additionally, the
    operating partnership currently intends to manage its
    capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating
    on its senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies,
    however, the operating partnership’s organizational
    documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that it may
    incur. Accordingly, management could alter or eliminate these
    policies without unitholder approval or circumstances could
    arise that could render it unable to comply with these policies.
    For example, decreases in the market price of the parent
    company’s common stock have caused an increase in the ratio
    of operating partnership’s share of total

debt-to-operating

partnership’s share of total market capitalization.

As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate principal amount of
    the operating partnership’s secured debt was
    $1.1 billion, excluding insignificant unamortized net
    premiums. Of the $1.1 billion of secured debt,
    $771.3 million, excluding unamortized discounts, is secured
    by properties in the operating partnership’s joint
    ventures. Such secured debt is generally non-recourse and, as of
    December 31, 2009, bore interest at rates varying from 0.7%
    to 9.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 4.5%) and had
    final maturity dates ranging from February 2010 to November
    2022. As of December 31, 2009, $622.4 million of the
    secured debt obligations bore interest at fixed rates (with a
    weighted average interest rate of 6.4%), while the remaining
    $474.1 million bore interest at variable rates (with a
    weighted average interest rate of 2.0%). As of December 31,
    2009, $610.5 million of the secured debt was held by
    co-investment ventures.

On September 4, 2008, the operating partnership entered
    into a $230.0 million secured term loan credit agreement
    set to mature on September 4, 2010. In December 2009, the
    operating partnership paid off the entire balance under this
    facility.

As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.2 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 6.4% and had an average term of 6.1 years. The
    unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various
    covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants,
    including compliance with financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and
    limitations on mergers or consolidations.

As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had
    $482.9 million outstanding in other debt which bore a
    weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and had an average term
    of 2.8 years. Other debt also includes a $70.0 million
    credit facility obtained on August 24, 2007 by AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P., a subsidiary of the
    operating partnership, which had a $50.0 million balance
    outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Of the remaining
    $432.9 million outstanding in other debt,
    $425.0 million is related to the loan facility described
    below.



In October 2009, the operating partnership refinanced its
    $325.0 million unsecured term loan facility, which was set
    to mature in September 2010, with a $345.0 million
    multi-currency facility, maturing October 2012. In December
    2009, the operating partnership exercised its option and
    increased the facility to $425.0 million, in accordance
    with the terms set forth in the credit facility. As of
    December 31, 2009, the facility had an outstanding balance
    of $417.7 million, using the exchange rates in effect at
    December 31, 2009. The parent company guarantees the
    operating partnership’s obligations with respect to certain
    of its unsecured debt. These covenants contain affirmative
    covenants, including compliance with financial reporting
    requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and
    negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of
    liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. The
    operating partnership was in compliance with its financial
    covenants under its unsecured credit facilities at
    December 31, 2009.

If the operating partnership is unable to refinance or extend
    principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds
    from other capital transactions, then its cash flow may be
    insufficient to pay cash distributions to the operating
    partnership’s unitholders in all years and to repay debt
    upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or
    other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance
    of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in
    higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest
    expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.
    This increased interest expense would adversely affect its
    financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and
    ability to pay cash distributions to its unitholders and make
    payments to its noteholders.

The operating partnership may from time to time, seek to retire
    or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases

and/or

exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases,
    privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases
    or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market
    conditions, its liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions
    and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

If the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall
    below current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under the
    operating partnership’s unsecured credit facilities and
    certain term loans will increase. In addition, if the long-term
    debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment
    grade, the operating partnership may be unable to request
    borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or
    Japanese Yen, as applicable. However, the lack of other currency
    borrowings does not affect the operating partnership’s
    ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term
    loans. However, the operating partnership’s lenders will
    not be able to terminate its credit facilities or certain term
    loans in the event that its credit rating falls below investment
    grade status. None of the operating partnership’s credit
    facilities contain covenants regarding the parent company’s
    stock price or market capitalization, thus a decrease in the
    parent company’s stock price is not expected to impact the
    operating partnership’s ability to borrow under its
    existing lines of credit. While the operating partnership
    currently does not expect its long-term debt ratings to fall
    below investment grade, in the event that the ratings do fall
    below those levels, it may be unable to exercise its options to
    extend the term of its credit facilities and the loss of the
    operating partnership’s ability to borrow in foreign
    currencies could affect its ability to optimally hedge its
    borrowings against foreign currency exchange rate changes. In
    addition, based on publicly available information regarding its
    lenders, the operating partnership currently does not expect to
    lose borrowing capacity under its existing lines of credit as a
    result of a dissolution, bankruptcy, consolidation, merger or
    other business combination among its lenders. The operating
    partnership’s access to funds under its credit facilities
    is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to
    such facilities to meet their funding commitments to the
    operating partnership. If the operating partnership does not
    have sufficient cash flows and income from its operations to
    meet its financial commitments and lenders are not able to meet
    their funding commitments to the operating partnership, the
    operating partnership’s business, results of operations,
    cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.

The operating partnership’s primary financial covenants
    with respect to its credit facilities generally relate to fixed
    charge or debt service coverage, liabilities to asset value,
    debt to asset value and unencumbered cash flow. As of
    December 31, 2009, the operating partnership was in
    compliance with its financial covenants under its credit
    facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that if the
    financial markets and economic conditions worsen, the operating
    partnership will be able to continue to comply with its
    financial covenants.

Certain of the operating partnership’s third party
    indebtedness is held by its consolidated or unconsolidated joint
    ventures. In the event that a joint venture partner is unable to
    meet its obligations under the operating partnership’s
    joint venture agreements or the third party debt agreements, the
    operating partnership may elect to pay



its joint venture partner’s portion of debt to avoid
    foreclosure on the mortgaged property or permit the lender to
    foreclose on the mortgaged property to meet the joint
    venture’s debt obligations. In either case, the operating
    partnership would lose income and asset value on the property.

In addition, a continued increase in the cost of credit and
    inability to access the capital and credit markets may adversely
    impact the occupancy of the operating partnership’s
    properties, the disposition of its properties, private capital
    raising and contribution of properties to its co-investment
    ventures. If it is unable to contribute completed development
    properties to its co-investment ventures or sell its completed
    development projects to third parties, the operating partnership
    will not be able to recognize gains from the contribution or
    sale of such properties and, as a result, the net income
    available to its common unitholders and its funds from
    operations will decrease. Additionally, business layoffs,
    downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that
    affect the operating partnership’s customers may adversely
    impact its business and financial condition. Furthermore,
    general uncertainty in the real estate markets has resulted in
    conditions where the pricing of certain real estate assets may
    be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to capitalization
    rates and valuations, among other things, which may add to the
    difficulty of buyers or the operating partnership’s
    co-investment ventures to obtain financing on favorable terms to
    acquire such properties or cause potential buyers to not
    complete acquisitions of such properties. The market uncertainty
    with respect to capitalization rates and real estate valuations
    also adversely impacts the operating partnership’s net
    asset value.

While the operating partnership believes that it has sufficient
    working capital and capacity under its credit facilities to
    continue its business operations as usual in the near term,
    continued turbulence in the global markets and economies and
    prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may
    adversely affect its liquidity and financial condition, as well
    as the liquidity and financial condition of its customers. If
    these market conditions persist, recur or worsen in the long
    term, they may limit the operating partnership’s ability,
    and the ability of its customers, to timely replace maturing
    liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity
    needs. In the event that it does not have sufficient cash
    available to it through its operations to continue operating its
    business as usual, the operating partnership may need to find
    alternative ways to increase its liquidity. Such alternatives
    may include, without limitation, divesting the operating
    partnership of properties, whether or not they otherwise meet
    its strategic objectives to keep in the long term, at less than
    optimal terms; issuing and selling the operating
    partnership’s debt and equity in public or private
    transactions under less than optimal conditions; entering into
    leases with the operating partnership’s customers at lower
    rental rates or less than optimal terms; entering into lease
    renewals with the operating partnership’s existing
    customers with a decrease in rental rates at turnover or on
    suboptimal terms; or paying a portion of the parent
    company’s dividends in stock rather than cash. There can be
    no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase
    its liquidity will be available to the operating partnership.
    Additionally, taking such measures to increase its liquidity may
    adversely affect the operating partnership’s business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

As circumstances warrant, the operating partnership may issue
    debt securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis,
    dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The
    operating partnership would use the proceeds to repay debt,
    including borrowings under its lines of credit, to make
    acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or
    U.S. or foreign property-owning or real estate-related
    entities or platforms, to invest in newly formed or existing
    joint ventures, or for general corporate purposes.

Credit Facilities.

The operating partnership
    has a $550.0 million (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds
    sterling or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured
    revolving credit facility that matures on June 1, 2010. The
    parent company is a guarantor of the operating
    partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The
    line carries a one-year extension option, which the operating
    partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the
    operating partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment
    grade, among other things, and the facility can be increased to
    up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on
    the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was
    42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2009, based on
    the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating, with an
    annual facility fee of 15.0 basis points. If the operating
    partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below investment
    grade, it will be unable to request money market loans and
    borrowings in Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The
    four-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component,
    under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in Euros,
    Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollars. The operating
    partnership uses the credit facility principally for
    acquisitions, funding development activity and general working
    capital



requirements. As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding
    balance on this credit facility was $55.5 million and the
    remaining amount available was $481.7 million, net of
    outstanding letters of credit of $12.8 million, using the
    exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2009.

AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating
    partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit
    facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion
    Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect at
    December 31, 2009, equaled approximately
    $591.3 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted
    average interest rate of 0.70%. The parent company, along with
    the operating partnership, guarantees the obligations of AMB
    Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the
    obligations of any other entity in which the operating
    partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest
    and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under
    and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to
    use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and
    development of properties and for other real estate purposes in
    Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the
    credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of
    the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real
    estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate
    assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a
    one-year extension option, which the operating partnership may
    exercise at its sole option so long as the operating
    partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment grade,
    among other things. The extension option is also subject to the
    satisfaction of certain other conditions and the payment of an
    extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments
    under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is
    generally TIBOR plus a margin, which was 42.5 basis points
    as of December 31, 2009, based on the credit rating of the
    operating partnership’s long-term debt. In addition, there
    is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which
    is based on the credit rating of the operating
    partnership’s long-term debt, and was 15.0 basis
    points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of
    December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange
    rate in effect on December 31, 2009, was
    $182.9 million, and the remaining amount available was
    $408.4 million.

The operating partnership and certain of its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, each acting as a borrower, with the parent company
    and the operating partnership as guarantors, have a
    $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The
    parent company, along with the operating partnership, guarantees
    the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities
    controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the
    operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under
    and pursuant to this credit facility. Generally, borrowers under
    the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion
    of the borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility
    includes a multi-currency component under which up to
    $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong
    dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds
    sterling, and Euros with the ability to add Indian rupees. The
    line, which matures in July 2011, carries a one-year extension
    option, which the operating partnership may exercise at its sole
    option so long as the operating partnership’s long-term
    debt rating is investment grade, among other things, and can be
    increased to up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions
    and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the
    outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally
    LIBOR plus a margin, which was 60.0 basis points as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the credit rating of the
    operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt,
    with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the
    operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. If
    the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall
    below investment grade, it will be unable to request borrowings
    in any currency other than U.S. dollars. The borrowers
    intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the
    acquisition and development of properties and general working
    capital requirements. As of December 31, 2009, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange
    rates in effect at December 31, 2009, was approximately
    $239.2 million with a weighted average interest rate of
    0.89%, and the remaining amount available was
    $260.8 million.

The above credit facilities contain affirmative covenants,
    including compliance with financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative
    covenants of the operating partnership, including limitations on
    the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or
    consolidations. The operating partnership was in compliance with
    its financial covenants under each of these credit agreements as
    of December 31, 2009.

Operating partnership’s share of total debt represents the
    operating partnership’s pro rata portion of the total debt
    based on the operating partnership’s percentage of equity
    interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated joint
    ventures holding the debt. The operating partnership believes
    that operating partnership’s share of total debt is a
    meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management
    and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its
    leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for
    a more meaningful comparison of the operating partnership’s
    debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their
    joint ventures. Operating partnership’s share of total debt
    is not intended to reflect the operating partnership’s
    actual liability should there be a default under any or all of
    such loans or a liquidation of the co-investment ventures. The
    above table reconciles operating partnership’s share of
    total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure.



As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had debt
    maturing in 2010 through 2013, assuming extension options are
    exercised, as follows (dollars in thousands):

    total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus
    market capital. The definition of “operating
    partnership’s share of total market capitalization” is
    the operating partnership’s share of total debt plus
    preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market capital.
    The operating partnership’s definition of “market
    capital” is the total number of outstanding common general
    partnership units of the operating partnership and common
    limited partnership units of AMB Property II, L.P. multiplied by
    the closing price per share of the parent company’s common
    stock as of December 31, 2009. The definition of
    “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation
    preferences. “Operating partnership’s share of total
    book capitalization” is defined as the operating
    partnership’s share of total debt plus noncontrolling
    interests to preferred unitholders and limited partnership



unitholders plus stockholders’ equity. “Operating
    partnership’s share of total debt” is the operating
    partnership’s pro rata portion of the total debt based on
    its percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated
    and unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt.
    “Operating partnership’s share of total assets”
    is the operating partnership’s pro rata portion of the
    gross book value of real estate interests plus cash and other
    assets. The operating partnership believes that operating
    partnership’s share of total debt is a meaningful
    supplemental measure, which enables both management and
    investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to
    that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more
    meaningful comparison of the operating partnership’s debt
    to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint
    ventures. Operating partnership’s share of total debt is
    not intended to reflect the operating partnership’s actual
    liability should there be a default under any or all of such
    loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a
    reconciliation of operating partnership’s share of total
    debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure,
    please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization above.

Liquidity
    of the Operating Partnership

As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had
    $187.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and
    $18.9 million in restricted cash. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the operating partnership increased the
    availability under its lines of credit by approximately
    $441 million while reducing its share of outstanding debt
    by approximately $713 million. As of December 31,
    2009, the operating partnership had $1.2 billion available
    for future borrowings under its three multi-currency lines of
    credit, representing line utilization of 30%.

The operating partnership’s available cash and cash
    equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party
    financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in
    its operating accounts. The invested cash is invested in money
    market funds that invest solely in direct obligations of the
    government of the United States or in time deposits with certain
    financial institutions. To date, the operating partnership has
    experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or
    cash equivalents; however, the operating partnership can provide
    no assurances that access to its invested cash and cash
    equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the
    financial markets.

At any point in time, the operating partnership also has a
    significant amount of cash deposits in its operating accounts
    that are with third party financial institutions, which was, as
    of December 31, 2009, approximately $159.4 million on
    a consolidated basis. These balances exceed the Federal Deposit
    Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While the operating
    partnership monitors daily the cash balances in its operating
    accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate, these
    cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial
    institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in
    the financial markets. To date, the operating partnership has
    experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating
    accounts.

The following table sets forth the operating partnership’s
    distributions paid or payable per unit for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

The operating partnership anticipates that it will be required
    to use proceeds from debt and equity financings and the
    divestitures of properties, in addition to cash from its
    operations, to make its distribution payments and repay its
    maturing debt as it comes due. However, the operating
    partnership may not be able to obtain future financings on
    favorable terms or at all. The operating partnership’s
    inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at
    all would adversely affect its financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash



distributions to its unitholders and make payments to its
    noteholders. The operating partnership is currently exploring
    various options to monetize its development assets including
    contribution to funds where investment capacity is available,
    the formation of joint ventures and the sale of assets to third
    parties. The operating partnership is also exploring the
    potential sale of operating assets to further enhance liquidity.
    There can be no assurance, however, that the operating
    partnership will choose to or be able to monetize any of its
    assets.

Cash flows generated by the operating partnership’s
    business were sufficient to cover its distributions for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, including its
    distributions to the parent company, which are, in turn, paid to
    the parent company’s stockholders as dividends and
    distributions. Cash flows from the operating partnership’s
    real estate operations and private capital businesses, which are
    included in “Net cash provided by operating
    activities” in its Cash Flows from Operating Activities and
    cash flows from its real estate development and operations
    businesses which are included in “Net proceeds from
    divestiture of real estate” in its Cash Flows from
    Investing Activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows, were sufficient to pay distributions on common and
    preferred limited partnership units of the operating partnership
    and AMB Property II, L.P. and distributions to noncontrolling
    interests for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Cash Flows from
    Operating Activities alone were not sufficient to pay such
    dividends and distributions, as shown in the table below. The
    operating partnership uses proceeds from its businesses included
    in Cash Flows from Investing Activities (specifically, the
    proceeds from sales and contributions of properties as part of
    its real estate development and operations businesses) to fund
    distributions not covered by Cash Flows from Operating
    Activities.

The following table sets forth the summary of the operating
    partnership’s distributions paid or payable for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

    Commitments of the Operating Partnership

Lease Commitments.

The operating partnership
    has entered into operating ground leases on certain land
    parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities and office space with
    remaining lease terms from 1 to 54 years. The buildings and
    improvements subject to these ground leases are amortized
    ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or
    40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under
    non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of
    December 31, 2009 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Co-Investment Ventures.

The operating
    partnership enters into co-investment ventures with
    institutional investors, acting as the general partner or
    manager of such ventures. These co-investment ventures are
    managed by the operating partnership’s private capital
    group and provide the company with an additional source of
    capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and
    renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of
    December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had
    investments in co-investment ventures with a gross book value of
    $1.1 billion, which are consolidated for financial
    reporting purposes, and net equity investments in five
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures of $392.6 million and
    a gross book value of $6.6 billion. As of December 31,
    2009, the operating partnership may make additional capital
    contributions to current and planned co-investment ventures of
    up to $24.6 million pursuant to the terms of the
    co-investment venture agreements. From time to time, the
    operating partnership may raise additional equity commitments
    for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an
    open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in 2004
    with institutional investors, most of whom invest through a
    private real estate investment trust, and for AMB Europe
    Fund I, FCP-FIS, an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment
    venture formed in 2007 with institutional investors. This would
    increase the operating partnership’s obligation to make
    additional capital commitments to these ventures. Pursuant to
    the terms of the partnership agreement of AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III, L.P., and the management regulations of
    AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, the operating partnership is
    obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments
    until such time when its total equity commitment is greater than
    $150.0 million or 150.0 million Euros, respectively,
    at which time, its obligation is reduced to 10% of the total
    equity commitments. The operating partnership expects to fund
    these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under
    its credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds
    from property divestitures, which could adversely affect its
    cash flow.

Captive Insurance Company.

In December 2001,
    the operating partnership formed a wholly-owned captive
    insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata),
    which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses
    below the attachment point of the operating partnership’s
    third-party insurance policies. The captive insurance company is
    one element of the operating partnership’s overall risk
    management program. The company capitalized Arcata in accordance
    with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata establishes
    annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss
    experience of the operating partnership’s properties. Like
    premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid
    to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific
    lease terms. Through this structure, the operating partnership
    believes that it has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market.

Potential Contingent and Unknown
    Liabilities.

Contingent and unknown liabilities
    may include the following:

•

liabilities for environmental conditions;

•

losses in excess of insured coverage;

•

claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the
    company’s predecessors prior to the company’s
    formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted
    or were unknown prior to the operating partnership’s
    formation or acquisition transactions;

•

claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and
    directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the
    operating partnership’s properties;

•

accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course
    of business; and

•

tax, legal and regulatory liabilities.

    “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” as of
    December 31, 2009, the company had outstanding guarantees
    and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of
    $415.6 million as described below.

As of December 31, 2009, the company had outstanding bank
    guarantees in the amount of $0.4 million used to secure
    contingent obligations, primarily obligations under development
    and purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2009, the
    company also guaranteed $47.9 million and
    $106.7 million on outstanding loans on six of its
    consolidated joint ventures and four of its unconsolidated joint
    ventures, respectively.

Also, the company has entered into contribution agreements with
    certain of its unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These
    contribution agreements require the company to make additional
    capital contributions to the applicable co-investment venture
    fund upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of
    certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional
    capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than the company’s share of the co-investment
    venture’s debt obligation or the value of the
    company’s share of any property securing such debt. The
    company’s contribution obligations under these agreements
    will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the
    fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the
    debt and obtained by the lender upon default. The company’s
    potential obligations under these contribution agreements
    totaled $260.6 million as of December 31, 2009.

Performance and Surety Bonds.

As of
    December 31, 2009, the company had outstanding performance
    and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $5.1 million.
    These bonds were issued in connection with certain of the
    company’s development projects and were posted to guarantee
    certain property tax obligations and the construction of certain
    real property improvements and infrastructure. Performance and
    surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the
    property taxes due or the completion of the improvements and
    infrastructure.

Promote Interests and Other Contractual
    Obligations.

Upon the achievement of certain
    return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, the
    company may be obligated to make payments to certain of its
    joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of
    their contractual agreements with the company. From time to time
    in the normal course of its business, the company enters into
    various contracts with third parties that may obligate the
    company to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other
    obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.



SUPPLEMENTAL
    EARNINGS MEASURES

Funds
    From Operations (“FFO”) and Funds From Operations Per
    Share and Unit (“FFOPS”)

The company believes that net (loss) income, as defined by
    U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure.
    However, the company considers funds from operations, or FFO,
    and FFO per share and unit, or FFOPS, to be useful supplemental
    measures of its operating performance. The company defines FFOPS
    as FFO per fully diluted weighted average share of the parent
    company’s common stock and operating partnership units. The
    company calculates FFO as net (loss) income available to common
    stockholders, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less
    gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for
    investment purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and
    adjustments to derive the company’s pro rata share of FFO
    of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.

The company includes the gains from development, including those
    from value-added conversion projects, before depreciation
    recapture, as a component of FFO. The company believes gains
    from development should be included in FFO to more completely
    reflect the performance of one of its lines of business. The
    company believes that value-added conversion dispositions are in
    substance land sales and as such should be included in FFO,
    consistent with the real estate investment trust industry’s
    long standing practice to include gains on the sale of land in
    FFO. However, the company’s interpretation of FFO or FFOPS
    may not be consistent with the views of others in the real
    estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be a
    divergence from the National Association of Real Estate
    Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition, and may not
    be comparable to FFO or FFOPS reported by other real estate
    investment trusts that interpret the current NAREIT definition
    differently than the company does. In connection with the
    formation of a joint venture, the company may warehouse assets
    that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to
    the newly formed venture. Some of the properties held for
    contribution may, under certain circumstances, be required to be
    depreciated under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises,
    the company intends to include in its calculation of FFO gains
    or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated
    real estate to joint ventures. Although such a change, if
    instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT
    definition, the company believes such calculation of FFO will
    better reflect the value created as a result of the
    contributions. To date, the company has not included gains or
    losses from the contribution of previously depreciated
    warehoused assets in FFO.

The company believes that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful
    supplemental measures of its operating performance because
    historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance
    with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real
    estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected
    through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since
    real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market
    and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have
    considered presentation of operating results for real estate
    companies that use historical cost accounting to be
    insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of
    operating performance for real estate investment trusts that
    exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among
    other items, from net (loss) income available to common
    stockholders, as defined by U.S. GAAP. The company believes
    that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the required
    U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving
    the understanding of operating results of real estate investment
    trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of
    operating results among such companies more meaningful. The
    company considers FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for
    reviewing comparative operating and financial performance
    because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of
    previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real
    estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the
    investing public compare the operating performance of a
    company’s real estate between periods or as compared to
    other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely
    used measures of operating performance of real estate investment
    trusts, FFO and FFOPS do not represent cash flow from operations
    or net (loss) income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not
    be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating
    the company’s liquidity or operating performance. FFO and
    FFOPS also do not consider the costs associated with capital
    expenditures related to the company’s real estate assets
    nor are FFO and FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available
    to fund the company’s future cash requirements. Management
    compensates for the limitations of FFO and FFOPS by providing
    investors with financial statements prepared according to
    U.S. GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO and
    FFOPS and a reconciliation of FFO and FFOPS to net (loss) income
    available to common stockholders, a U.S. GAAP measurement.



The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled
    from net (loss) income available to common unitholders of the
    operating partnership and common stockholders of the parent
    company for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

    distributed through declared dividends and allocated to all
    participating securities (weighted average common shares and
    units outstanding and unvested restricted shares outstanding)
    under the two-class method. Under this method, allocations were
    made to 918,753, 855,919 and 652,838 unvested restricted shares
    outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008,
    and 2007, respectively.

Same
    Store Net Operating Income (“SS NOI”)

The company defines net operating income, or NOI, as rental
    revenues, including reimbursements, less property operating
    expenses. NOI excludes depreciation, amortization, general and
    administrative expenses, restructuring charges, real estate
    impairment losses, development profits (losses), gains (losses)
    from sale or contribution of real estate interests, and interest
    expense. The company believes that net income, as defined by
    GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, NOI is
    a useful supplemental measure calculated to help investors
    understand the company’s operating performance, excluding
    the effects of costs and expenses which are not related to the
    performance of the assets. NOI is widely used by the real estate
    industry as a useful supplemental measure, which helps investors
    compare the company’s operating performance with that of
    other companies. Real estate impairment losses have been
    excluded in deriving NOI because the company does not consider
    its impairment losses to be a property operating expense. The
    company believes that the exclusion of impairment losses from
    NOI is a common methodology used in the real estate industry.
    Real estate impairment



losses relate to the changing values of the company’s
    assets but do not reflect the current operating performance of
    the assets with respect to their revenues or expenses. The
    company’s real estate impairment losses are non-cash
    charges which represent the write down in the value of assets
    when estimated fair value over the holding period is lower than
    current carrying value. The impairment charges were principally
    a result of increases in estimated capitalization rates and
    deterioration in market conditions that adversely impacted
    underlying real estate values. Therefore, the impairment charges
    are not related to the current performance of the company’s
    real estate operations and should be excluded from its
    calculation of NOI.

The company considers same store net operating income, or SS
    NOI, and cash-basis SS NOI to be useful supplemental measures of
    its operating performance for properties that are considered
    part of the same store pool. The company defines SS NOI as NOI
    on a same store basis. The company defines cash-basis SS NOI as
    SS NOI excluding straight-line rents and amortization of lease
    intangibles. The same store pool includes all properties that
    are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year
    reporting periods and excludes development properties for both
    the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is
    set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments
    stabilized after December 31, 2007. The company considers
    cash-basis SS NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental
    performance measure because it reflects the operating
    performance of the real estate portfolio excluding effects of
    non-cash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual
    cash-basis rental growth for a

year-over-year

comparison. In addition, the company believes that SS NOI and
    cash-basis SS NOI help investors compare the operating
    performance of its real estate as compared to other companies.
    While SS NOI and cash-basis SSNOI are relevant and widely used
    measures of operating performance of real estate investment
    trusts, they do not represent cash flow from operations or net
    income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as
    alternatives to those measures in evaluating the company’s
    liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI
    also do not reflect general and administrative expenses,
    interest expenses, real estate impairment losses, depreciation
    and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs,
    or trends in development and construction activities that could
    materially impact the company’s results from operations.
    Further, the company’s computation of SS NOI and cash-basis
    SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate
    companies, as they may use different methodologies for
    calculating SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI.

The following table reconciles SS NOI, cash-basis SS NOI and
    cash-basis SS NOI, excluding lease termination fees from net
    (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market
    prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. The
    company’s future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon
    prevailing market rates. Accordingly, the company manages its
    market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating,
    investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows
    for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures,
    distributions to stockholders and unitholders, payments to
    noteholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of the
    company’s outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which
    minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. The
    company’s exposure to market risk includes interest rate
    fluctuations in connection with its credit facilities and other
    variable rate borrowings and its ability to incur more debt
    without stockholder and unitholder approval, thereby increasing
    its debt service obligations, which could adversely affect its
    cash flows. As of December 31, 2009, the company had one
    outstanding interest rate swap, four outstanding foreign
    exchange forward contracts and two interest rate caps with an
    aggregate notional amount of $836.4 million (in
    U.S. dollars). See “Financial Instruments” below.

The table below summarizes the maturities and interest rates
    associated with the company’s fixed and variable rate debt
    outstanding at book value and estimated fair value before

If market rates of interest on the company’s variable rate
    debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or
    decrease in interest cost on the company’s variable rate
    debt would be $2.3 million (net of the swap) annually. As
    of December 31, 2009, the book value and the estimated fair
    value of the company’s total consolidated debt (both
    secured and unsecured) were $3.2 billion and
    $3.2 billion, respectively, based on the company’s
    estimate of current market interest rates. As of
    December 31, 2008, the book value and the estimated fair
    value of the company’s total consolidated debt (both
    secured and unsecured) were $4.0 billion and
    $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of
    current market interest rates.

As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
    variable rate debt comprised 38.8% and 38.0%, respectively, of
    all the company’s outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was
    $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

Financial Instruments.

The company records all
    derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or
    liability. For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, the
    offset to this entry is to accumulated other comprehensive
    income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity for
    the parent company, partners’ capital for the operating
    partnership or income. For derivatives which do not qualify as
    cash flow hedges, the offset to the change in fair value on the
    derivative asset or liability is recorded directly in earnings
    as gains or losses through other income (expenses). For revenues
    or expenses denominated in non-functional currencies, the
    company may use derivative financial instruments to manage
    foreign currency exchange rate risk. The company’s
    derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31,
    2009 were one interest rate swap and two interest rate caps
    hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on
    U.S. LIBOR and four foreign exchange forward contracts
    hedging intercompany loans. The company does not hold or issue
    derivatives for trading purposes.

International Operations.

The company’s
    exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange
    rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for
    the company’s subsidiaries operating in the United States,
    Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. The functional
    currency for the company’s subsidiaries operating outside
    the United States, other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in
    Europe, is generally the local currency of the country in which
    the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of
    foreign exchange gains and losses. The company’s
    subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
    U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into
    U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the
    exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. The
    company translates income statement accounts using the average
    exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring
    transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The
    (losses) gains resulting from the translation are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component
    of stockholders’ equity for the parent company or
    partners’ capital for the operating partnership and totaled
    $(22.0) million and $23.6 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The company’s international subsidiaries may have
    transactions denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currency. In these instances, non-monetary assets and
    liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange



rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the
    exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income
    statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate
    for the period. The company also records gains or losses in the
    income statement when a transaction with a third party,
    denominated in a currency other than the entity’s
    functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash
    flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the
    exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. For
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures and Changes to Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

The parent company maintains disclosure controls and procedures
    that are designed to ensure that information required to be
    disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act
    of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
    forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
    to its management, including its chief executive officer and
    chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
    evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the parent
    company’s management recognizes that any controls and
    procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
    control objectives, and its management is required to apply its
    judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
    controls and procedures. Also, the parent company has
    investments in certain unconsolidated entities, which are
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As the
    parent company does not control or manage these entities, its
    disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities
    may be substantially more limited than those it maintains with
    respect to its consolidated subsidiaries.

As required by

Rule 13a-15(b)

or

Rule 15d-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, management
    of the parent company carried out an evaluation, under the
    supervision and with participation of its chief executive
    officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the
    design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures
    that were in effect as of the end of the year covered by this
    report. Based on the foregoing, the parent company’s chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer each concluded
    that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective at
    the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2009.

There have been no changes in the parent company’s internal
    control over financial reporting during its most recent fiscal
    quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect, its internal control over financial
    reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The parent company’s management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting.

The parent company’s management has used the framework set
    forth in the report entitled “Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate
    the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
    reporting. Based on the parent company’s evaluation under
    the framework in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework,” the parent company’s management has
    concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2009. The effectiveness



of the parent company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of AMB Property Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of AMB
    Property Corporation (the “Company”) listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of the Company and its
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
    statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
    Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounted
    for uncertain tax positions in 2007, the manner in which it
    accounted for fair value measurements of financial and
    nonfinancial instruments in 2008 and 2009, respectively, the
    manner in which it accounted for business combinations in 2009
    and the manner in which it accounted for noncontrolling
    interests in 2009. As discussed in Note 17 to the
    consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the
    manner in which participating securities are included in
    earnings per share in 2009.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Partners of AMB Property, L.P.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements of AMB
    Property, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of the Operating
    Partnership and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Operating Partnership
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Operating
    Partnership’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Item 9A. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
    Operating Partnership’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
    audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
    material misstatement and whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and

    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Operating Partnership changed the manner in
    which it accounted for uncertain tax positions in 2007, the
    manner in which it accounted for fair value measurements of
    financial and nonfinancial instruments in 2008 and 2009,
    respectively, the manner in which it accounted for business
    combinations in 2009 and the manner in which it accounted for
    noncontrolling interests in 2009. As discussed in Note 17
    to the consolidated financial statements, the Operating
    Partnership changed the manner in which participating securities
    are included in earnings per unit in 2009.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007

1.

Organization
    and Formation of the Parent Company and the Operating
    Partnership

The Parent Company commenced operations as a fully integrated
    real estate company effective with the completion of its initial
    public offering on November 26, 1997. The Parent Company
    elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust
    (“REIT”) under Sections 856 through 860 of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
    “Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended
    December 31, 1997, and believes its current organization
    and method of operation will enable it to maintain its status as
    a REIT. The Parent Company, through its controlling interest in
    its subsidiary, the Operating Partnership, is engaged in the
    ownership, acquisition, development and operation of industrial
    properties in key distribution markets throughout the Americas,
    Europe and Asia. Unless otherwise indicated, the notes to
    consolidated financial statements apply to both the Parent
    Company and the Operating Partnership.

The Company uses the terms “industrial properties” or
    “industrial buildings” to describe the various types
    of industrial properties in its portfolio and uses these terms
    interchangeably with the following: logistics facilities,
    centers or warehouses; distribution facilities, centers or
    warehouses; High Throughput
    Distribution

®

(HTD

®

)

    facilities; or any combination of these terms. The Company uses
    the term “owned and managed” to describe assets in
    which it has at least a 10% ownership interest, for which it is
    the property or asset manager and which it currently intends to
    hold long term. The Company uses the term “joint
    venture” to describe all joint ventures, including
    co-investment ventures with real estate developers, other real
    estate operators, or institutional investors where the Company
    may or may not have control, act as the manager

and/or

developer, earn asset management distributions or fees, or earn
    incentive distributions or promote interests. In certain cases,
    the Company might provide development, leasing, property
    management

and/or

accounting services, for which it may receive compensation. The
    Company uses the term “co-investment venture” to
    describe joint ventures with institutional investors, managed by
    the Company, from which the Company typically receives
    acquisition fees for acquisitions, portfolio and asset
    management distributions or fees, as well as incentive
    distributions or promote interests.

As of December 31, 2009, the Parent Company owned an
    approximate 97.8% general partnership interest in the Operating
    Partnership, excluding preferred units. The remaining
    approximate 2.2% common limited partnership interests are owned
    by non-affiliated investors and certain current and former
    directors and officers of the Parent Company. As the sole
    general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company
    has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion
    in the

day-to-day

management and control of the Operating Partnership. Net
    operating results of the Operating Partnership are allocated
    after preferred unit distributions based on the respective
    partners’ ownership interests. Certain properties are owned
    by the Company through limited partnerships, limited liability
    companies and other entities. The ownership of such properties
    through such entities does not materially affect the
    Company’s overall ownership interests in the properties.

Through the Operating Partnership, the Company enters into
    co-investment ventures with institutional investors. These
    co-investment ventures provide the Company with an additional
    source of capital and income. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Company had significant investments in three consolidated and
    five unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

Any references to the number of buildings, square footage,
    customers and occupancy in the financial statement footnotes are
    unaudited.

On July 18, 2008, the Company acquired the remaining equity
    interest (approximately 42%) in G. Accion, S.A. de C.V.
    (“G. Accion”), a Mexican real estate company. G.
    Accion is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and has
    been renamed AMB Property Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (“AMB
    Property Mexico”). AMB Property Mexico owns and develops
    real estate and provides real estate management and development
    services in Mexico.

AMB Capital Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
    (“AMB Capital Partners”), provides real estate
    investment services to clients on a fee basis. Headlands Realty
    Corporation, a Maryland corporation, conducts a variety of
    businesses that includes development projects available for sale
    or contribution to third parties

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and incremental income programs. IMD Holding Corporation, a
    Delaware corporation, conducts a variety of businesses that also
    includes development projects available for sale or contribution
    to third parties. AMB Capital Partners, Headlands Realty
    Corporation and IMD Holding Corporation are direct subsidiaries
    of the Operating Partnership.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company owned or had
    investments in, on a consolidated basis or through
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures, properties and
    development projects expected to total approximately
    155.1 million square feet (14.4 million square meters)
    in 47 markets within 14 countries.

Of the approximately 155.1 million square feet as of
    December 31, 2009:

•

on an owned and managed basis, which includes investments held
    on a consolidated basis or through unconsolidated joint
    ventures, the Company owned or partially owned approximately
    132.6 million square feet (principally, warehouse
    distribution buildings) that were 91.2% leased; the Company had
    investments in 15 development projects, which are expected to
    total approximately 5.3 million square feet upon
    completion; and the Company owned 33 projects, totaling
    approximately 9.7 million square feet, which are available
    for sale or contribution;

•

through non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, the Company
    had investments in 46 industrial operating buildings, totaling
    approximately 7.4 million square feet; and

•

the Company held approximately 152,000 square feet through
    a ground lease, which is the location of the Company’s
    global headquarters.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements included herein have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows of the Company, its wholly owned
    qualified REIT and taxable REIT subsidiaries, the Operating
    Partnership and co-investment ventures, in which the Company has
    a controlling interest. Third-party equity interests in the
    Operating Partnership and co-investment ventures are reflected
    as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial
    statements. The Company also has non-controlling partnership
    interests in unconsolidated real estate co-investment ventures,
    which are accounted for under the equity method. All significant
    intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications.

Certain items in the
    consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been
    reclassified to conform to current classifications.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless
    circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which
    case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is
    made to reduce it to its estimated fair value. The Company also
    reviews the impact of above or below-market leases, in-place
    leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions, and records
    an intangible asset or liability accordingly.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local airport
    authorities, and subject to ground leases are depreciated over
    the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the
    underlying ground lease. The estimated lives and components of
    depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are as follows (dollars in

The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase
    price of the property including legal fees and, for 2008 and
    2007, acquisition costs. Upon adoption of new accounting
    guidance related to business combinations, the Company has
    elected to expense acquisition costs related to business
    combinations and will continue to capitalize land acquisition
    costs. Project costs directly associated with the development
    and construction of a real estate project, which include
    interest and property taxes, are capitalized as construction in
    progress. Capitalized interest related to construction projects
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    $41.3 million, $64.4 million and $64.0 million,
    respectively.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Maintenance expenditures include
    painting and repair costs. The Company expenses costs as
    incurred and does not accrue in advance of planned major
    maintenance activities. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic useful life of assets are capitalized
    and include parking lot, HVAC and roof replacement costs.

Real Estate Impairment Losses.

The Company
    conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes
    in accordance with its policy of accounting for the impairment
    or disposal of long-lived assets, which indicates that asset
    values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may
    not be fully recoverable. The intended use of an asset, either
    held for sale or held for the long term, can significantly
    impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is intended to be
    held for the long term, the impairment analysis is based on a
    two-step test. The first test measures estimated expected future
    cash flows over the holding period, including a residual value
    (undiscounted and without interest charges), against the
    carrying value of the property. If the asset fails the first
    test, then the asset carrying value is measured against the
    estimated fair value from a market participant standpoint, with
    the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated
    fair value recognized as an impairment charge to earnings. If an
    asset is intended to be sold, impairment is tested based on a
    one-step test, comparing the carrying value to the estimated
    fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of expected future
    net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions
    regarding current and future economic and market conditions and
    the availability of capital. The Company determines the
    estimated fair

values based on assumptions regarding rental rates, costs to

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values.
    The Company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams
    and the recent valuations of its two open-ended funds, which
    contain a large, geographically diversified pool of assets, all
    of which are subject to third-party appraisals on at least an
    annual basis. As a result of changing market conditions, the
    Company re-evaluated the carrying value of its investments and
    recognized real estate impairment losses of $181.9 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2009 on certain of its
    investments. The Company recognized real estate impairment
    losses of $193.9 million and $1.2 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Investments in Consolidated and Unconsolidated Joint
    Ventures.

The Company holds interests in both
    consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company
    consolidates joint ventures where it exhibits financial or
    operational control. Control is determined using accounting
    standards related to the consolidation of joint ventures and
    variable interest entities. For joint ventures that are defined
    as variable interest entities, the primary beneficiary
    consolidates the entity. In instances where the Company is not
    the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the joint
    venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures
    that are not defined as variable interest entities, management
    first considers whether the Company is the general partner or a
    limited partner (or the equivalent in such investments which are
    not structured as partnerships). The Company consolidates joint
    ventures where it is the general partner (or the equivalent) and
    the limited partners (or the equivalent) in such investments do
    not have rights which would preclude control and, therefore,
    consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For joint
    ventures where the Company is the general partner (or the
    equivalent), but does not control the joint venture as the other
    partners (or the equivalent) hold substantive participating
    rights, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. For
    joint ventures where the Company is a limited partner (or the
    equivalent), management considers factors such as ownership
    interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and
    contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners
    (or the equivalent) to determine if the presumption that the
    general partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances
    where these factors indicate the Company controls the joint
    venture, the Company consolidates the joint venture; otherwise
    it uses the equity method of accounting.

Under the equity method, investments in unconsolidated joint
    ventures are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost
    and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the Company’s
    proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint
    venture, distributions received, contributions, deferred gains
    from the contribution of properties and certain other
    adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there
    may have been a loss in value of an equity investment, the
    Company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating
    the Company’s ability to recover its investment or if the
    loss in value is other than temporary. To evaluate whether an
    impairment is other than temporary, the Company considers
    relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the period of
    time in any unrealized loss position, the likelihood of a future
    recovery, and the Company’s positive intent and ability to
    hold the investment until the forecasted recovery. If the
    Company determines the loss in value is other than temporary,
    the Company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the
    investment at fair value. Fair value is determined through
    various valuation techniques, including, but not limited to,
    discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third
    party appraisals. At December 31, 2009, valuations of AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.’s and AMB-SGP Mexico,
    LLC’s properties were below the book value of the
    Company’s investment in those funds. No impairment charge
    was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007 because the Company deemed the impairments to be
    temporary. However, the Company’s analysis is an ongoing
    process and there can be no assurance that the Company will not
    recognize such impairment charges in the future.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less. These balances exceed the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While
    the Company monitors daily the cash balances in its operating
    accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate, these
    cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial
    institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in
    the financial markets. To date, the Company has experienced no
    loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with property purchases,
    Section 1031 exchange accounts and debt or real estate tax
    payments.

Accounts Receivable.

Accounts receivable
    includes all current accounts receivable, net of allowances,
    other accruals and deferred rent receivable of
    $68.4 million and $63.9 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company
    regularly reviews the credit worthiness of its customers and
    adjusts its allowance for doubtful accounts, straight-line rent
    receivable balance and tenant improvement and leasing costs
    amortization accordingly.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

Other real
    estate companies compete with the Company in its real estate
    markets. This results in competition for customers to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Company’s ability to lease space and
    on the amount of rent received. As of December 31, 2009,
    the Company does not have any material concentration of credit
    risk due to the diversification of its customers.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the straight-line method, which
    approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the
    related loan. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, deferred
    financing costs were $24.9 million and $25.3 million,
    respectively, net of accumulated amortization.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

The Company
    has classified as goodwill the cost in excess of fair value of
    the net assets of companies acquired in purchase transactions.
    In accordance with the Company’s policy of accounting for
    goodwill and other intangible assets, goodwill and certain
    indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but
    are subject to at least annual impairment testing. The Company
    tests annually (or more often, if necessary) for impairment
    under this policy. The Company determined that there was no
    impairment to goodwill and intangible assets pursuant to this
    testing during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Income Taxes.

The Company follows Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance for accounting
    for uncertainty in income taxes, which clarifies the accounting
    and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions and seeks to
    reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects
    of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for
    income taxes. Adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2007
    did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
    statements. The tax years 2004 through 2008 remain open to
    examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the
    Company is subject.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

Effective
    April 1, 2009, the FASB issued guidance which the Company
    has adopted regarding the evaluation of the fair value of
    financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as
    in annual financial statements. Due to their short-term nature,
    the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents,
    restricted cash, accounts receivable, dividends payable, and
    accounts payable and other liabilities approximate their book
    value. Based on borrowing rates available to the Company at
    December 31, 2009, the book value and the estimated fair
    value of total debt (both secured and unsecured) were both
    $3.2 billion. The estimated fair value of deferred
    financing costs approximates its book value.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities.

Based on
    the Company’s policy of accounting for derivative
    instruments and hedging activities, the Company records all
    derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The majority of
    the Company’s derivatives are either designated or qualify
    as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future
    cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, and are
    considered cash flow hedges. For revenues or expenses
    denominated in nonfunctional currencies, the Company may use
    derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency
    exchange rate risk. The Company assesses the effectiveness of
    each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value
    or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the
    changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged
    item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges,
    changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Hedge
    accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of
    gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the
    recognition of the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted
    transactions in a cash flow hedge.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s derivative financial instruments in effect at
    December 31, 2009 consisted of one interest rate swap
    hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on
    U.S. Libor (USD), two interest rate caps hedging cash flows
    of variable rate borrowings based on USD, and four currency
    forward contracts hedging intercompany loans. Adjustments to the
    fair value of the interest rate swap and one interest rate cap
    are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet
    and accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated
    statements of equity. Adjustments to the fair value of one
    interest rate cap and the four currency forward contracts are
    included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and
    other income (expenses) in the consolidated statements of
    operations. The adjustments to fair value for year ended
    December 31, 2009 are discussed in Note 22.

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities.

In
    September 2006, the FASB issued guidance related to accounting
    for fair value measurements which defines fair value and
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in order to
    meet disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Fair
    value is defined as the exchange price that would be received
    for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
    the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    on the measurement date. This guidance also establishes a fair
    value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value. This hierarchy describes three levels
    of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the
    consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs
    to the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
    liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative
    contracts that are traded in an active exchange market.

Level 2.

Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities
    include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less
    frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative
    contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with
    inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation using
    unobservable inputs. This category generally includes long-term
    derivative contracts, real estate and unconsolidated joint
    ventures.

The fair value at December 31, 2009 reflects an

other-than-temporary

loss on impairment of an investment of $3.7 million
    recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during
    the year ended December 31, 2009.

Debt.

The Company’s debt includes both
    fixed and variable rate secured debt, fixed and variable rate
    unsecured debt, unsecured variable rate debt and credit
    facilities. Based on borrowing rates available to the Company at
    December 31, 2009, the book value and the estimated fair
    value of the total debt (both secured and unsecured) were both
    $3.2 billion.

Debt Premiums and Discounts.

Debt premiums
    (discounts) represent the excess (deficiency) of the fair value
    of debt over the principal value of debt assumed in connection
    with the Company’s initial public offering and subsequent
    property acquisitions. The debt premiums and discounts are being
    amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt
    instrument using the straight-line method, which approximates
    the effective interest method. As of both December 31, 2009
    and 2008, the net unamortized debt discount was
    $9.8 million, and was included as a component of secured
    debt and unsecured senior debt on the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets.

Rental Revenues and Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts.

The Company, as a lessor, retains
    substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership of the
    properties and accounts for its leases as operating leases.
    Rental income is

F-17


AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases.
    Reimbursements from customers for real estate taxes and other
    recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the
    period the applicable expenses are incurred. The Company also
    records lease termination fees when a customer terminates its
    lease by executing a definitive termination agreement with the
    Company, vacates the premises and the payment of the termination
    fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met before the
    fee is due to the Company. In addition, the Company nets its
    allowance for doubtful accounts against rental income for
    financial reporting purposes. Such amounts totaled
    $6.1 million, $3.9 million and $3.7 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Private Capital Income.

Private capital income
    consists primarily of acquisition and development fees, asset
    management fees and priority distributions earned by the Company
    from co-investment ventures and clients. Private capital income
    also includes promote interests and incentive distributions from
    the Operating Partnership’s co-investment ventures. The
    Company received incentive distributions of $2.9 million,
    $33.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, during
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Development Profits, Net of Taxes.

When the
    Company disposes of its real estate entities’ interests,
    gains reported from the sale of these interests represent
    either: (i) the sale of partial interests in consolidated
    co-investment ventures to third-party investors for cash or
    (ii) the sale of partial interests in properties to
    unconsolidated co-investment ventures with third-party investors
    for cash.

Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate
    Interests.

Gains and losses are recognized using
    the full accrual method. Gains related to transactions which do
    not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of
    accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual
    method of accounting criteria are met. During 2009, the Company
    completed the installment sale of one 0.2 million square
    foot development property and recognized a gain of
    $0.2 million. The remaining gain of $3.9 million
    related to this sale was deferred as of December 31, 2009
    and will be recognized in 2010.

Other Income (Expense).

Other income (expense)
    consists primarily of foreign currency remeasurement losses and
    gains, losses and gains on the Company’s nonqualified
    deferred compensation plan and interest income from mortgages
    receivable and on cash and cash equivalents.

Discontinued Operations.

The Company reported
    real estate dispositions as discontinued operations separately
    as prescribed under the FASB guidance on accounting for the
    impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company
    separately reports as discontinued operations the historical
    operating results attributable to operating properties sold or
    held for sale and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition
    of the properties, which is included in development profits and
    gains from sale of real estate interests, net of taxes, in the
    statement of operations. The consolidated statements of
    operations for prior periods are also retrospectively adjusted
    to conform with new guidance regarding accounting for
    discontinued operations and noncontrolling interests. There is
    no impact on the Company’s previously reported consolidated
    financial position, net (loss) income available to common
    stockholders or cash flows.

Comprehensive (Loss) Income.

The Parent
    Company reports comprehensive (loss) income in its consolidated
    statement of equity. The Operating Partnership reports
    comprehensive (loss) income in its consolidated statement of
    capital. Comprehensive (loss) income was $(46.2) million,
    $4.0 million and $384.8 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

International Operations.

The U.S. dollar
    is the functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries
    formed in the United States, Mexico and certain subsidiaries in
    Europe. Other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe,
    the functional currency for the Company’s subsidiaries
    operating outside the United States is generally the local
    currency of the country in which the entity or property is
    located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and
    losses on the results of operations. The Company’s
    subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
    U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into
    U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the
    exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. The
    Company translates income statement accounts using the average
    exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring
    transactions using the rate on the transaction date.

For the Parent Company, these gains (losses) are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate

    Partnership, these gains (losses) are included in partners’
    capital.

The Company’s international subsidiaries may have
    transactions denominated in currencies other than their
    functional currencies. In these instances, non-monetary assets
    and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rates,
    monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange
    rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement
    gain or loss accounts are remeasured at the average exchange
    rate for the period. The Company also records gains or losses in
    the income statement when a transaction with a third party,
    denominated in a currency other than the entity’s
    functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash
    flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the
    exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated.
    These gains (losses) are included in the consolidated statements
    of operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company adopted policies of fair value
    measurement with respect to its financial assets and
    liabilities. In the year ended December 31, 2009, in
    conjunction with a review for impairment (as discussed in
    Note 3), selected assets were adjusted to fair value and
    impairment charges were recorded. Additionally, effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted a policy of accounting
    for fair value measurements with respect to its nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities. This adoption had no material impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted policies
    related to accounting for business combinations, which changes
    the accounting for business combinations including the
    measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a
    business combination, the recognition of contingent
    consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss
    contingencies, the accounting for acquisition-related
    restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of
    acquisition-related transaction costs and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    With respect to transactions costs, the Company has elected to
    expense acquisition costs related to business combinations,
    which were previously capitalized during the interim period
    prior to adoption as of January 1, 2009. The Company will
    continue to capitalize land acquisition costs. This adoption did
    not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
    statements.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted policies
    related to accounting for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity or
    capital in the consolidated financial statements. As a result of
    the adoption of these policies, the Company has retrospectively
    renamed the minority interests as noncontrolling interests and
    has reclassified these balances to the equity or capital
    sections of the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, on the
    consolidated statements of operations, the presentation of net
    income (loss) retrospectively includes the portion of income
    attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted policies
    related to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
    activities

,

which provides enhanced disclosures about
    (a) how and why the Company uses derivative instruments,
    (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under the Company’s accounting policy, and
    (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    affect the Company’s financial position, financial
    performance and cash flows. This adoption did not have a
    material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Effective June 30, 2009, the Company adopted a policy

In June 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance related to the
    consolidation of variable-interest entities. These amendments
    require an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination
    of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”) based on whether the entity (1) has the
    power to direct matters that most

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and (2) has
    the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
    of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
    Additionally, they require an ongoing reconsideration of the
    primary beneficiary and provide a framework for the events that
    trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a VIE. This
    guidance will be effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The Company
    is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of
    this guidance will have on its financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In June 2009, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (Codification) which identifies the sources of
    accounting principles and the framework for selecting the
    principles used in the preparation of its financial statements
    that are presented in conformity with GAAP. Effective
    September 30, 2009, the Company adopted the Codification,
    which did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial statements.

Impairment
    and Restructuring Charges

The Company conducted a comprehensive review of all real estate
    asset classes in accordance with its policy of accounting for
    the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which indicates
    that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property
    may not be fully recoverable. The process entailed the analysis
    of each asset class for instances where the book value might
    exceed the estimated fair value. As a result of changing market
    conditions, a portion of the Company’s real estate assets
    were written down to estimated fair value and a non-cash
    impairment charge was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008
    and first quarter of 2009.

In order to comply with the Company’s disclosure
    requirements related to fair value measurements, the designation
    of the level of inputs used in the fair value models must be
    determined. Inputs used in establishing estimated fair value for
    real estate assets generally fall within level three, which are
    characterized as requiring significant judgment as little or no
    current market activity may be available for validation. The
    main indicator used to establish the classification of the
    inputs was current market conditions that, in many instances,
    resulted in the use of significant unobservable inputs in
    establishing estimated fair value measurements.

The Company used the market participant pricing approach to
    estimate the fair value of land, assets under development and
    assets held for sale or contribution, which estimates what a
    potential buyer would pay today. The key inputs used in the
    model included the Company’s intent to sell, hold or
    contribute, along with capitalization and rental growth rate
    assumptions, estimated costs to complete and expected lease up
    and holding periods. When available, current market information,
    like comparative sales price, was used to determine
    capitalization and rental growth rates. When market information
    was not readily available, the inputs were based on the
    Company’s understanding of market conditions and the
    experience of the management team. Actual results could differ
    significantly from the Company’s estimates.

The principal trigger which led to the impairment charges was
    continued economic deterioration in some markets resulting in a
    decrease in the assumptions of leasing and rental rates and
    rising vacancies. In addition, the pricing of current
    transactions in some of the Company’s markets, as well as
    in-process sales agreements on some of its assets targeted for
    disposition were indicative of an increase in capitalization
    rates. Additional impairments may be necessary in the future in
    the event that market conditions continue to deteriorate and
    impact the factors used to estimate fair value. The real estate
    impairment losses recognized on these assets represent the
    difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair
    value, which, on a consolidated basis, totaled approximately
    $59.7 million for land, $115.2 million for assets
    under development and assets available for sale or contribution
    and $7.0 million for industrial operating properties for
    the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company recognized
    real estate impairment losses of approximately
    $94.7 million for land and $99.2 million for assets
    under development and assets available for sale or contribution
    for the year ended December 31, 2008.

The impairment charges disclosed above do not impact the
    Company’s liquidity, cost and availability of credit or
    affect the Operating Partnership’s continued compliance
    with its various financial covenants under its credit facilities
    and unsecured bonds.

In the second quarter of 2009, the Company continued a
    broad-based cost reduction plan that was initiated in the fourth
    quarter of 2008. As a result, the Company recognized
    restructuring charges of approximately $6.4 million and
    $12.3 million, respectively, in the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, associated with severance,
    office closures and the termination of certain contractual
    obligations. During 2009 and 2008, $3.9 million and all of
    the restructuring charges were cash-related expenses,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
    accrued liabilities of $2.5 million for restructuring
    charges to be paid in 2010.

Real
    Estate Acquisition and Development Activity

During 2009, the Company did not acquire any properties. During
    2008, the Company acquired 10 properties in the Americas, Asia
    and Europe aggregating approximately 2.8 million square
    feet for $217.0 million.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had 15

construction-in-progress

development projects, on an owned and managed basis, which are
    expected to total approximately 5.3 million square feet and
    have an aggregate estimated investment of $447.6 million
    upon completion, net of $28.2 million of cumulative real
    estate impairment losses to date. Two of these projects totaling
    approximately 0.8 million square feet with an aggregate
    estimated investment of $87.3 million were held in an
    unconsolidated co-investment venture.

Construction-in-progress,

at December 31, 2009, included projects expected to be
    completed through the fourth quarter of 2011. As of
    December 31, 2009, on a consolidated basis, the Company and
    its development joint venture partners had funded an aggregate
    of $346.6 million, or 89%, of the total estimated
    investment before the impact of real estate impairment losses
    and will need to fund an estimated additional
    $41.8 million, or 11%, in order to complete the
    Company’s development pipeline.

In addition to the Company’s committed

construction-in-progress,

it held a total of 2,395 acres of land for future
    development or sale, on a consolidated basis, approximately 85%
    of which was located in North America. The Company currently
    estimates that these 2,395 acres of land could support
    approximately 43.6 million square feet of future
    development.

On a consolidated basis, as of December 31, 2009, the
    Company had an additional 33 pre-stabilized development projects
    totaling approximately 9.7 million square feet, with an
    aggregate estimated investment of $981.8 million, net of
    $84.2 million of cumulative real estate impairment losses
    to date, and an aggregate gross book value of
    $953.0 million, net of cumulative real estate impairment
    losses.

Debt of
    the Parent Company

The Parent Company itself does not hold any indebtedness. All
    debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating
    Partnership. The Parent Company has guaranteed some of the
    Operating Partnership’s secured debt and all of the
    Operating Partnership’s unsecured debt. The debt that is
    guaranteed by the Parent Company is discussed below. Note 7
    below entitled “Debt of the Operating Partnership”
    should be read in conjunction with this Note 6 for a
    discussion of the debt of the Operating Partnership consolidated
    into the Parent Company’s financial statements. In this
    Note 6, the “Parent Company” refers only to AMB
    Property Corporation and not to any of its subsidiaries.

Unsecured
    Senior Debt Guarantees

The Parent Company guarantees the Operating Partnership’s
    obligations with respect to its unsecured senior debt
    securities. As of December 31, 2009, the Operating
    Partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.2 billion in
    unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average
    interest rate of 6.4% and had an average term of 6.1 years.
    In May 2008, the Operating Partnership issued and sold
    $325.0 million aggregate principal amount of its senior
    unsecured notes under its Series C medium-term note
    program. The indenture for the senior debt securities contains
    limitations on mergers or consolidations of the Parent Company.

Other
    Debt Guarantees

The Parent Company guarantees the Operating Partnership’s
    obligations with respect to $425.0 million of its other
    debt, related to the following loan facility. In October 2009,
    the Operating Partnership refinanced its $325.0 million
    senior unsecured term loan facility, which was set to mature in
    September 2010, with a $345.0 million multi-currency
    facility, maturing October 2012. In December 2009, the Operating
    Partnership exercised its option and increased the facility to
    $425.0 million, in accordance with the terms set forth in
    the credit facility. The facility includes Euro and Yen
    tranches, with both the multi-currency and the U.S. dollar
    components currently priced at 275 basis points over the
    applicable LIBOR index.

Unsecured
    Credit Facility Guarantees

The Parent Company is a guarantor of the Operating
    Partnership’s obligations under its $550.0 million
    (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or
    U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving
    credit facility that matures on June 1, 2010.

The Parent Company and the Operating Partnership guarantee the
    obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the
    Operating Partnership, under a Yen-denominated unsecured
    revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any
    other entity in which the Operating Partnership directly or
    indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from
    time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit
    agreement. This credit facility has an initial borrowing limit
    of 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in
    effect on December 31, 2009, equaled approximately
    $591.3 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted
    average interest rate of 0.70%.

The Parent Company and the Operating Partnership guarantee the
    obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled
    by the Operating Partnership that are selected by the Operating
    Partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant
    to a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility.

and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, each acting as a
    borrower, and the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership,
    as guarantors, entered into this credit facility, which has an
    option to further increase the facility to $750.0 million,
    to extend the maturity date to July 2011 and to allow for
    borrowing in Indian rupees.

The credit agreements related to the above facilities contain
    limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on
    mergers or consolidations of the Parent Company.

If the Operating Partnership is unable to refinance or extend
    principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds
    from other capital transactions, then its cash flow may be
    insufficient to pay its distributions to the Parent Company,
    which will have, as a result, insufficient funds to pay cash
    dividends to the Parent Company’s stockholders.
    Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at
    the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to
    make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest
    rates upon refinancing, then the Operating Partnership’s
    interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would
    increase. This increased interest expense of the Operating
    Partnership would adversely affect its ability to pay its
    distributions to the Parent Company, which will, in turn,
    adversely affect the Parent Company’s ability to pay cash
    dividends to its stockholders and the market price of the Parent
    Company’s stock.

In the event that the Operating Partnership does not have
    sufficient cash available through its operations or under its
    lines of credit to continue operating its business as usual,
    including making its distributions to the Parent Company, it may
    need to find alternative ways to increase its liquidity. Such
    alternatives may include, without limitation, decreasing the
    Operating Partnership’s cash distribution to the Parent
    Company and paying some of the Parent Company’s dividends
    in stock rather than cash. In addition, the Parent Company may
    issue equity in public or private transactions whether or not
    with favorable pricing or on favorable terms and contribute the
    proceeds of such issuances to the Operating Partnership for a
    number of partnership units in the Operating Partnership equal
    to the number of shares of Parent Company stock issued in the
    applicable transaction.

Wholly
    owned and Consolidated Joint Venture Secured Debt

Secured debt generally requires monthly principal and interest
    payments. Some of the loans are cross-collateralized by multiple
    properties. The secured debt is collateralized by deeds of
    trust, mortgages or other instruments on certain properties and
    is generally non-recourse. As of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the total gross investment book value of those properties
    securing the debt was $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion,
    respectively, including $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion
    held in consolidated joint ventures, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2009, $622.4 million of the secured debt
    obligations bore interest at fixed rates (with a weighted
    average interest rate of 6.4%), while the remaining
    $474.1 million bore interest at variable rates (with a
    weighted average interest rate of 2.0%). As of December 31,
    2009, $610.5 million of the secured debt was held by the
    Operating Partnership’s co-investment ventures.

On September 4, 2008, the Operating Partnership entered
    into a $230.0 million secured term loan credit agreement
    set to mature on September 4, 2010. In December 2009, the
    Operating Partnership paid off the entire outstanding balance
    under this facility.

The Operating Partnership recognized a loss on early
    extinguishment of debt of $12.3 million in relation to
    early repayments of secured debt including the
    $230.0 million facility mentioned above and the completion
    of the repurchase of bonds in connection with the Operating
    Partnership’s tender offers in 2009.

Unsecured
    Senior Debt

As of December 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership had
    outstanding an aggregate of $1.2 billion in unsecured
    senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest
    rate of 6.4% and had an average term of 6.1 years.

In November 2009, the Operating Partnership issued
    $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior
    unsecured notes, consisting of a new series of
    $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.125% notes due 2016 and a new series of
    $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.625% notes due 2019, respectively. The Parent Company
    guarantees the Operating Partnership’s obligations with
    respect to its unsecured senior debt securities.

In November 2009, the Company commenced a cash tender offer to
    purchase up to $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount
    of the Operating Partnership’s outstanding 6.3% medium-term
    notes due 2013, 5.9% medium-term notes due 2013, 7.0%
    medium-term notes due 2011 and 6.75% medium-term notes due 2011.
    The tender offer expired in December 2009, with approximately
    $88.0 million, $74.9 million and $6.0 million in
    aggregate principal amount of the 6.3% medium-term notes due
    2013, 5.9% medium-term notes due 2013 and 7.0% medium-term notes
    due 2011, respectively, validly tendered, not withdrawn and
    accepted for payment.

In June 2009, the Operating Partnership also repurchased at an
    8% discount, $8.2 million aggregate principal amount of its
    Series C medium-term notes due 2013, guaranteed by the
    Parent Company, for $7.5 million.

In April 2009, the Company commenced a cash tender offer to
    purchase any and all of the Operating Partnership’s
    outstanding 8.00% medium-term notes due 2010, guaranteed by the
    Parent Company, which had $75.0 million aggregate principal
    outstanding, and any and all of the Operating Partnership’s
    outstanding 5.45% medium-term notes due 2010, guaranteed by the
    Parent Company, which had $175.0 million aggregate
    principal outstanding. The tender offer expired in May 2009,
    with $28.5 million and $146.5 million in aggregate
    principal amount of the 8.00% medium-term notes due 2010 and
    5.45% medium-term notes due 2010, respectively, validly
    tendered, not withdrawn and accepted by the Operating
    Partnership for purchase at par.

In May 2008, the Operating Partnership issued and sold
    $325.0 million aggregate principal amount of its senior
    unsecured notes under its Series C medium-term note program.

The Parent Company guarantees the Operating Partnership’s
    obligations with respect to its unsecured senior debt
    securities. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to
    various covenants of the Operating Partnership.

These covenants contain affirmative covenants, including
    compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance
    of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including
    limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on
    mergers or consolidations. The Operating Partnership was in
    compliance with its financial covenants for all unsecured senior
    debt securities at December 31, 2009.

Other
    Debt

As of December 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership had
    $482.9 million outstanding in other debt which bore a
    weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and had an average term
    of 2.8 years. Of the total other debt, $425.0 million
    is related to the loan facility described below.

In October 2009, the Operating Partnership refinanced its
    $325.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility, which
    was set to mature in September 2010, with a $345.0 million
    multi-currency facility, maturing October 2012. In December
    2009, the Operating Partnership exercised its option and
    increased the facility to $425.0 million, in accordance
    with the terms set forth in the credit facility. Using the
    exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2009, the facility
    had an outstanding balance of approximately $417.7 million
    in U.S. dollars. The Parent Company guarantees the
    Operating Partnership’s obligations with respect to certain
    of its unsecured debt. These covenants contain affirmative
    covenants, including compliance with financial reporting
    requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and
    negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of
    liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. The
    Operating Partnership was in compliance with its financial
    covenants for all other debt at December 31, 2009.

Unsecured
    Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership had
    three credit facilities with total capacity of approximately
    $1.6 billion.

The Operating Partnership has a $550.0 million (includes
    Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollar
    denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility that
    matures on June 1, 2010. The Parent Company is a guarantor
    of the Operating Partnership’s obligations under the credit
    facility. The line carries a one-year extension option, which
    the Operating Partnership may exercise at its sole option so
    long as the Operating Partnership’s long-term debt rating
    is investment grade, among other things, and the facility can be
    increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The
    rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which
    was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2009, based
    on the Operating Partnership’s long-term debt rating, with
    an annual facility fee of 15.0 basis points. If the
    Operating Partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below
    investment grade, the Operating Partnership will be unable to
    request money market loans and borrowings in Euros, Yen or
    British pounds sterling. The four-year credit facility includes
    a multi-currency component, under which up to
    $550.0 million can be drawn in Euros, Yen, British pounds
    sterling or U.S. dollars. The Operating Partnership uses
    the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding
    development activity and general working capital requirements.
    As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance on this
    credit facility was $55.5 million, which bore a weighted
    average interest rate of 0.68%, and the remaining amount
    available was $481.7 million, net of outstanding letters of
    credit of $12.8 million, using the exchange rate in effect
    on December 31, 2009.

AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the Operating
    Partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit
    facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion
    Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on
    December 31, 2009, equaled approximately
    $591.3 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted
    average interest rate of 0.70%. The Parent Company and the
    Operating Partnership guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan
    Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the
    obligations of any other entity in which the Operating
    Partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest
    and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under
    and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to
    use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and
    development of properties and for other real estate purposes in
    Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the
    credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of
    the borrowings under the credit

facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities
    holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in
    June 2010 and has a one-year extension option, which the
    Operating Partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as
    the Operating Partnership’s long-term debt rating is
    investment grade, among other things. The extension option is
    also subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the
    payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding
    commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the
    borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which was
    42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2009, based on
    the credit rating of the Operating Partnership’s long-term
    debt. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable
    quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the Operating
    Partnership’s long-term debt and was 15.0 basis points
    of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of
    December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange
    rate in effect on December 31, 2009, was
    $182.9 million, and the remaining amount available was
    $408.4 million.

The Operating Partnership and certain of its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, each acting as a borrower, and the Parent Company
    and the Operating Partnership, as guarantors, have a
    $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The
    Parent Company and the Operating Partnership guarantee the
    obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled
    by the Operating Partnership that are selected by the Operating
    Partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant
    to the credit facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit
    facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the
    borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility
    includes a multi-currency component under which up to
    $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong
    dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds
    sterling, and Euros with the ability to add Indian rupees. The
    line, which matures in July 2011, carries a one-year extension
    option, which the Operating Partnership may exercise at its sole
    option so long as the Operating Partnership’s long-term
    debt rating is investment grade, among other things, and can be
    increased up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions and
    the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the
    outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally
    LIBOR plus a margin, which was 60.0 basis points as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the credit rating of the
    Operating Partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt,
    with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the
    Operating Partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. If
    the Operating Partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall
    below current levels, its cost of debt will increase. If the
    Operating Partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below
    investment grade, the Operating Partnership will be unable to
    request borrowings in any currency other than U.S. dollars.
    The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to
    fund the acquisition and development of properties and general
    working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2009, the
    outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange
    rates in effect at December 31, 2009, was approximately
    $239.2 million with a weighted average interest rate of
    0.89%, and the remaining amount available was
    $260.8 million.

The above credit facilities contain affirmative covenants of the
    Operating Partnership, including compliance with financial
    reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial
    ratios, and negative covenants of the Operating Partnership,
    including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations
    on mergers or consolidations. The Operating Partnership was in
    compliance with its financial covenants under each of these
    credit agreements at December 31, 2009.

As of December 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership had
    $187.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, held in
    accounts managed by third party financial institutions,
    consisting of invested cash and cash in the Operating
    Partnership’s operating accounts. In addition, the
    Operating Partnership had $1.2 billion available for future
    borrowings under its three multicurrency lines of credit at
    December 31, 2009. In the event that the Operating
    Partnership does not have sufficient cash available to it
    through its operations or under its lines of credit to continue
    operating its business as usual, the Operating Partnership may
    need to find alternative ways to increase its liquidity. Such
    alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting itself
    of properties; issuing the Operating Partnership’s debt
    securities; entering into leases with the Operating
    Partnership’s customers at lower rental rates or less than
    optimal terms; entering into lease renewals with its existing
    customers without an increase or with a decrease in rental rates
    at turnover; or the Parent Company issuing equity and
    contributing the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

If the long-term debt ratings of the Operating Partnership fall
    below current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under the
    Operating Partnership’s unsecured credit facilities and
    certain term loans will increase. In addition, if the long-term
    debt ratings of the Operating Partnership fall below investment
    grade, the Operating Partnership may be unable to request
    borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or
    Japanese Yen, as applicable; however, the lack of other currency
    borrowings does not affect the Operating Partnership’s
    ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term
    loans. The loss of its ability to borrow in currencies other
    than U.S. dollars or Japanese Yen could affect its ability
    to optimally hedge its borrowings against foreign currency
    exchange rate changes.

As of December 31, 2009, the scheduled maturities and

Income
    Taxes of the Parent Company

The Parent Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code,
    commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1997.
    To qualify as a REIT, the Parent Company must meet a number of
    organizational and operational requirements, including a
    requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its
    taxable income to its stockholders. While historically the
    Parent Company has satisfied this distribution requirement by
    making cash distributions to its stockholders, the Parent
    Company may choose to satisfy this requirement by making
    distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited
    circumstances, its own stock. It is management’s current
    intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the
    Parent Company’s REIT status. As a REIT, the Parent Company
    generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income
    tax on net income it distributes currently to its stockholders.
    As such, no provision for federal income taxes has been included
    in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. If the
    Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year,
    it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate
    rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may
    be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable
    years. Even if the Parent Company qualifies for taxation as a
    REIT, the Parent Company may be subject to certain state and
    local taxes on its income and excise taxes on its undistributed
    taxable income. The Parent Company is required to pay federal
    and state income tax on its net taxable income, if any, from the
    activities conducted by the Parent Company’s taxable REIT
    subsidiaries. Foreign income taxes are accrued for foreign
    countries in which the Parent Company operates, as necessary.

In connection with its decision to curtail development
    activities, as of December 31, 2008, the Parent Company
    incurred charges of approximately $5.0 million to establish
    a reserve against tax assets associated with a reduction in
    development, which is recorded in general and administrative
    expense on the consolidated statement of operations. The Parent
    Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for
    deferred tax assets if it is determined, based on available
    evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more
    likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the Parent Company concluded, based on a review of the
    relative weight of the available evidence, that it was more
    likely than not that it would not generate sufficient future
    taxable income to realize all of its deferred tax assets.

The following is a reconciliation of net (loss) income available
    to common stockholders to taxable income available to common
    stockholders for the years ended December 31 (dollars in

Income
    Taxes of the Operating Partnership

As a partnership, the allocated share of income of the Operating
    Partnership is included in the income tax returns of its
    partners. Accordingly, no accounting for income taxes is
    required in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
    The Operating Partnership may be subject to certain state, local
    and foreign taxes on its income and property. In addition, the
    Operating Partnership is required to pay federal and state
    income tax on its net taxable income, if any, from the
    activities conducted by the Operating Partnership’s taxable
    REIT subsidiaries. Where the Operating Partnership operates in
    countries other than the United States that do not recognize
    REITs under their respective tax laws, the Operating Partnership
    recognizes income taxes as necessary.

The following is a reconciliation of net (loss) income available
    to common unitholders attributable to the general partner to
    taxable income available to common unitholders attributable to
    the general partner for the years ended December 31 (dollars in

Noncontrolling
    Interests in the Operating Partnership

Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership represent
    limited partnership interests in AMB Property II, L.P., a
    Delaware limited partnership, and interests held by third party
    partners in several real estate joint ventures, aggregating
    approximately 21.0 million square feet, which are
    consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

The Operating Partnership holds interests in both consolidated
    and unconsolidated joint ventures. The Operating Partnership
    consolidates joint ventures where it exhibits financial or
    operational control. Control is determined using accounting
    standards related to the consolidation of joint ventures and
    variable interest entities. For joint ventures that are defined
    as variable interest entities, the primary beneficiary
    consolidates the entity. In instances where the Operating
    Partnership is not the primary beneficiary, it does not
    consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes.
    For joint ventures that are not defined as variable interest
    entities, management first considers whether the Operating
    Partnership is the general partner or a limited partner (or the
    equivalent in such investments which are not structured as
    partnerships). The Operating Partnership consolidates joint
    ventures where it is the general partner (or the equivalent) and
    the limited partners (or the equivalent) in such investments do
    not have rights which would preclude control and, therefore,
    consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For joint
    ventures where the Operating Partnership is the general partner
    (or the equivalent), but does not control the joint

venture as the other partners (or the equivalent) hold
    substantive participating rights, the Operating Partnership uses
    the equity method of accounting. For joint ventures where the
    Operating Partnership is a limited partner (or the equivalent),
    management considers factors such as ownership interest, voting
    control, authority to make decisions, and contractual and
    substantive participating rights of the partners (or the
    equivalent) to determine if the presumption that the general
    partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances where
    these factors indicate the Operating Partnership controls the
    joint venture, the Operating Partnership consolidates the joint
    venture; otherwise it uses the equity method of accounting.

The Operating Partnership’s consolidated joint
    ventures’ total investment and property debt at

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Operating Partnership has consolidated joint ventures that
    have finite lives under the terms of the joint venture
    agreements. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the aggregate
    book value of the joint venture noncontrolling interests in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets was approximately
    $289.9 million and $293.4 million, respectively. The
    Operating Partnership believes that the aggregate settlement
    value of these interests was approximately $336.8 million
    at December 31, 2009 and $451.2 million at
    December 31, 2008. However, there can be no assurance that
    these amounts will be the aggregate settlement value of the
    interests. The aggregate settlement value is based on the
    estimated liquidation values of the assets and liabilities and
    the resulting proceeds that the Operating Partnership would
    distribute to its joint venture partners upon dissolution, as
    required under the terms of the respective joint venture
    agreements. There can be no assurance that the estimated
    liquidation values of the assets and liabilities and the
    resulting proceeds that the Operating Partnership distributes
    upon dissolution will be the same as the actual liquidation
    values of such assets, liabilities and proceeds distributed upon
    dissolution. Subsequent changes to the estimated fair values of
    the assets and liabilities of the consolidated joint ventures
    will affect the Operating Partnership’s estimate of the
    aggregate settlement value. The joint venture agreements do not
    limit the amount to which the noncontrolling joint venture
    partners would be entitled in the event of liquidation of the
    assets and liabilities and dissolution of the respective joint
    ventures.

    in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Mexico, LLC. These gains are included in development profits,
    net of taxes, in the consolidated statements of operations.
    During 2007, the Company recognized development profits of
    approximately $95.7 million, as a result of the
    contribution of 15 completed development projects and two land
    parcels, aggregating approximately 82 acres of land, to AMB
    Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB DFS Fund I,
    LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P.

Under the agreements governing the co-investment ventures, the
    Company and the other parties to the co-investment ventures may
    be required to make additional capital contributions and,
    subject to certain limitations, the co-investment ventures may
    incur additional debt.

Distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures are
    classified as either cash flows from operating activities or
    cash flows from investing activities in the Company’s
    consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the
    distribution received. Distributions from operations of the
    unconsolidated joint ventures are considered to be returns on
    investment and are classified as cash inflows from operating
    activities. If the unconsolidated joint venture sells assets, or
    performs any equity or debt financing, then the distribution to
    the Company of its share of the proceeds from the asset sale or
    financings is considered a return of investment that is
    classified as cash inflows from investing activities in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows.

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company received $9.5 million, $35.0 million and
    $0.2 million, respectively, from its unconsolidated joint
    ventures for the Company’s share of the proceeds from asset
    sales or financing during the respective periods.

On June 13, 2008, the Company acquired an additional
    approximate 19% interest in G. Accion, a Mexican real estate
    company that holds equity method investments, and as a result of
    its increased ownership, the Company began consolidating its
    interest in G. Accion, effective as of that date. On
    July 18, 2008, the Company acquired the remaining equity
    interest (approximately 42%) in G. Accion. As of

    Partnership or AMB Property II, L.P., as applicable, to redeem
    part or all of their common limited partnership units or
    class B common limited partnership units, as applicable,
    for cash (based upon the fair market value of an equivalent

    registered under the Securities Act of 1933, on a

one-for-one

basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock
    dividends, issuance of certain rights, certain extraordinary
    distributions and similar events. The redemption right is also
    subject to the limits on ownership and transfer of common stock
    set forth in the Parent Company’s charter. With each
    exchange of the Operating Partnership’s common limited
    partnership units for the Parent Company’s common stock,
    the Parent Company’s percentage ownership in the Operating
    Partnership will increase. The redemption right commences on or
    after the first anniversary of a unitholder becoming a limited
    partner of the Operating Partnership or of AMB Property II,

    treated as income to the common stockholders in the calculation
    of net (loss) income available to common stockholders, and
    contributed the series D preferred units to the Operating
    Partnership. The Operating Partnership issued 2,880,281 general
    partnership units to the Parent Company in exchange for the

    P preferred stock will be redeemable solely at the option of the
    Parent Company on and after December 13, 2010 and
    August 25, 2011, respectively, in whole or in part, at
    $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.

The Operating Partnership has classified the preferred and
    common units held by outside parties and by the Parent Company
    as permanent equity based on the following considerations:

•

The Operating Partnership determined that settlement in the
    Parent Company’s stock is equivalent to settlement in
    equity of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company’s
    only significant asset is its interest in the Operating
    Partnership and the Parent Company conducts substantially all of
    its business through the Operating Partnership. The Parent
    Company’s stock is the economic equivalent of the Operating
    Partnership’s corresponding units. The Company has
    concluded that a redemption and issuance of shares in exchange
    for units does not represent a delivery of assets.

•

In accordance with the guidance for Contracts in Entity’s
    Own Equity, the Operating Partnership, as the issuer of the
    units, controls the settlement options of the redemption of the
    units (shares or cash). Pursuant to an assignment agreement, the
    Parent Company has transferred to the Operating Partnership the
    right to elect to acquire some or all of any tendered units from
    the tendering partner in exchange for stock of the Parent
    Company. The unitholder has no control over whether it receives
    cash or Parent Company stock. There are no factors outside the
    issuer’s control that could impact those settlement options
    and there are no provisions that could require cash settlement
    upon redemption of units. The Operating Partnership units that
    are held by the Parent Company are redeemable only to maintain
    the 1:1 ratio of outstanding shares of the Parent Company to the
    outstanding units of the Operating Partnership and to facilitate
    the transfer of cash to the Parent Company from the Operating
    Partnership upon redemption of Parent Company stock. The Parent
    Company and the Operating Partnership are structured and
    operated as one interrelated, consolidated business under a
    single management. The decision to pay cash or have the Parent
    Company issue registered or unregistered shares of stock is made
    by a single management team acting for both the Operating
    Partnership and the Parent Company and causing the entities to
    act in concert.

•

Management has concluded that there is no conflict in fiduciary
    duty or interest with respect to the decision to settle a
    redemption request in cash or common shares of the Parent
    Company.

As of December 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership had
    outstanding 149,028,965 common general partnership units;
    2,119,928 common limited partnership units; 2,000,000 6.5%
    series L cumulative redeemable preferred units; 2,300,000
    6.75% series M cumulative redeemable preferred units;
    3,000,000 7.00% series O cumulative redeemable preferred
    units; and 2,000,000 6.85% series P cumulative redeemable
    preferred units.

In December 2007, the Parent Company’s board of directors
    approved a two-year common stock repurchase program for the
    repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the Parent
    Company’s common stock, which terminated on
    December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, the Parent Company did not repurchase any shares

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of its common stock. During the year ended December 31,
    2008, the Parent Company repurchased approximately
    1.8 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate
    price of $87.7 million at a weighted average price of
    $49.64 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Parent Company repurchased approximately 1.1 million
    shares of its common stock for an aggregate price of
    $53.4 million at a weighted average price of $49.87 per
    share. Immediately prior to any repurchase under this program,
    the Operating Partnership will repurchase a number of
    partnership units from the Parent Company equal to the number of
    shares of Parent Company common stock to be repurchased at a
    price per partnership unit equal to the price per share of
    common stock to be repurchased.

The net proceeds from the Parent Company’s March 2009
    offering of 47.4 million shares of common stock were
    contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for the
    issuance of 47.4 million general partnership units to the
    Parent Company. The proceeds were approximately
    $552.3 million, net of discounts, commissions and estimated
    transaction expenses of approximately $23.8 million.

    Incentive Plan, 401(k) Plan and Deferred Compensation
    Plan

Stock Incentive Plans.

The Company has stock
    option and incentive plans (“Stock Incentive Plans”)
    for the purpose of attracting and retaining eligible officers,
    directors and employees. The Company has authorized for issuance
    17,500,000 shares of common stock under its 2002 stock
    incentive plan of which 6,079,937 shares were remaining
    available for grant and 7,030,855 shares were reserved for
    issuance at December 31, 2009. As of December 31,
    2009, the Company had 8,107,697 non-qualified options
    outstanding granted to certain directors, officers and employees
    which includes 1,076,842 shares of common stock reserved
    for issuance for outstanding option grants under its 1997 stock
    incentive plan which expired in November 2007. Each option is
    exchangeable for one share of the Company’s common stock.
    Each option’s exercise price is equal to the Company’s
    market price on the date of grant. The options have an original
    ten-year term and generally vest pro rata in annual installments
    over a three to five-year period from the date of grant.

For each share of common stock the Parent Company issues
    pursuant to the Parent Company and Operating Partnership’s
    Stock Incentive Plans, the Operating Partnership will issue a
    corresponding common partnership unit to the Parent Company. As
    of December 31, 2009, the Stock Incentive Plans have
    approximately 6.1 million shares of common stock available
    for issuance as either stock options or restricted stock grants.
    The fair value of each option grant is generally estimated at
    the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
    The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and
    forfeitures within the valuation model. Expected volatilities
    are based on historical volatility of the Parent Company’s
    stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life
    of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
    effect at the time of the grant.

The Company values stock options using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model and recognizes this value as an expense
    over the vesting periods. Under this guidance, recognition of
    expense for stock options is applied to all options granted
    after the beginning of the year of adoption. In accordance with
    the adopted guidance, the Company will recognize the associated
    expense over the three to five-year vesting periods.
    Additionally, the Company awards restricted stock and recognizes
    this value as an expense over the vesting periods. As of
    December 31, 2009, there was $23.3 million of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based
    compensation arrangements granted under the Stock Incentive
    Plans. Of this total, $5.8 million of unrecognized
    compensation cost relates to stock options and
    $17.5 million relates to restricted stock awards that is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    1.7 years and 2.1 years, respectively.

The following table summarizes stock option expense and
    restricted stock expense, included in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended

401(k) Plan.

In November 1997, the Company
    established a Section 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan
    (the “401(k) Plan”), which is a continuation of the
    401(k) Plan of the Company’s predecessor, to cover eligible
    employees of the Company. During the first quarter of 2007, the
    401(k) Plan permitted eligible employees to defer up to 20% of
    their annual compensation (as adjusted under the terms of the
    401(k) Plan), subject to certain limitations imposed by the
    Code. During the remainder of 2007 and in 2008, the percentage
    of compensation that may be deferred was increased to 75%.
    During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company matched employee
    contributions under the 401(k) Plan in an amount equal to 50% of
    the first 6.0% of annual compensation deferred by each employee,
    up to a maximum match of $7,350, $6,900 and $6,750 per year,
    respectively, for each participating employee. In the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company made
    matching contributions of $0.9 million, $1.1 million
    and $1.0 million, respectively. The Company may also make
    discretionary contributions to the 401(k) Plan. No discretionary
    contributions were made by the Company to the 401(k) Plan in the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

The employees’ elective deferrals are immediately vested
    and non-forfeitable upon contribution to the 401(k) Plan.
    Matching contributions made by the Company vest fully one year
    after the commencement of an employee’s employment with the
    Company.

Deferred Compensation Plans.

The Company has
    established two non-qualified deferred compensation plans for
    eligible officers and directors of the Company and certain of
    its affiliates, which enable eligible participants to defer
    income from their U.S. payroll up to 100% of annual base
    pay, up to 100% of annual bonuses, up to 100% of their meeting
    fees

and/or

committee chairmanship fees, and up to 100% of certain
    equity-based compensation, as applicable, subject to
    restrictions, on a pre-tax basis. This deferred compensation is
    an unsecured obligation of the Company. The Company may make
    discretionary matching contributions to participant accounts at
    any time. The Company made no such discretionary matching
    contributions in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007. The participant’s elective deferrals and any
    matching contributions are immediately 100% vested. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the total fair value of
    compensation deferred was $66.2 million and
    $53.1 million, respectively, including $43.3 million
    and $36.2 million, respectively, of the Company’s
    common stock.

Income
    (Loss) Per Share and Unit

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted a policy
    which clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle
    their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting
    should be considered participating securities. As participating
    securities, these instruments should be included in the
    computation of earnings per share (“EPS”) using the
    two-class method. Pursuant to this adoption, the computation of
    EPS has been retrospectively adjusted for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Segment
    Information

The Company has two lines of business: real estate operations
    and private capital. Real estate operations is comprised of
    various segments while private capital consists of a single
    segment, on which the Company evaluates its performance:

•

Real Estate Operations.

The Company operates
    industrial properties and manages its business by geographic
    markets. Such industrial properties are typically comprised of
    multiple distribution warehouse facilities suitable for single
    or multiple customers who are engaged in various types of
    businesses. The geographic markets where the Company owns
    industrial properties are managed separately because it believes
    each market has its own economic characteristics and requires
    its own operating, pricing and leasing strategies. Each market
    is considered to be an individual operating segment. The
    accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The
    Company evaluates performance based upon property net operating
    income of the combined properties in each segment, which are
    listed below. In addition, the Company’s development
    business is included under real estate operations. It primarily
    consists of the Company’s development of real estate
    properties that are subsequently contributed to a co-investment
    venture fund in which the Company has an ownership interest and
    for which the Company acts as manager, or that are sold to third
    parties. The Company evaluates performance of the development
    business by reported operating segment based upon gains
    generated from the disposition

and/or

contribution of real estate. The assets of the development
    business generally include properties under development and land
    held for development. During the period between the completion
    of development of a property and the date the property is
    contributed to an unconsolidated co-investment venture or sold
    to a third party, the property and its associated rental income
    and property operating costs are included in the real estate
    operations segment because the primary activity associated with
    the property during that period is leasing. Upon contribution or
    sale, the resulting gain or loss is included as gains from sale
    or contribution of real estate interests or development profits,
    as appropriate.

•

Private Capital.

The Company, through its
    private capital group, AMB Capital Partners, LLC (“AMB
    Capital Partners”), provides real estate investment,
    portfolio management and reporting services to co-investment
    ventures and clients. The private capital income earned consists
    of acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and
    priority distributions, and promote interests and incentive
    distributions from the Company’s co-investment ventures and
    AMB Capital Partners’ clients. With respect to the
    Company’s U.S. and Mexico funds and co-investment
    ventures, the Company typically earns a 90.0 basis points
    acquisition fee on the acquisition cost of third party
    acquisitions, asset management priority distributions of 7.5% of
    net operating income on stabilized properties, 70.0 basis
    points of total projected costs as asset management fees on
    renovation or development properties, and incentive
    distributions of 15% of the return over a 9% internal rate of
    return and 20% of the return over a 12% internal rate of return
    to investors on a periodic basis or at the end of a fund’s
    life. In Japan, the Company earns a 90.0 basis points
    acquisition fee on the acquisition cost of third-party
    acquisitions, asset management priority distributions of 1.5% of
    unreturned equity, and incentive distributions of 20% of the
    return over a 10% internal rate of return and 25% of the return
    over a 13% internal rate of return to investors at the end of a
    fund’s life. In Europe, the Company earns a 90.0 basis
    points acquisition fee on the acquisition cost of third-party
    acquisitions, asset management fees of 75.0 basis points on
    the gross asset value of the fund, and incentive distributions
    of 20% of the return over a 9% internal rate of return and 25%
    of the return over a 12% internal rate of return to investors on
    a periodic basis. The accounting policies of the segment are the
    same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies under Note 2 of this document.

    Company’s regions defined as East, West and Central in the
    Americas. Japan is a part of the Company’s Asia region.

(2)

Property net operating income (“NOI”) is defined as
    rental revenues, including reimbursements, less property
    operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation, amortization,
    general and administrative expenses, restructuring charges, real
    estate impairment losses, development profits (losses), gains
    (losses) from sale or contribution of real estate interests, and
    interest expense. The Company believes that net income, as
    defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure.
    However, NOI is a useful supplemental measure calculated to help
    investors understand the Company’s operating performance,
    excluding the effects of costs and expenses which are not
    related to the performance of the assets. NOI is widely used by
    the real estate industry as a useful supplemental measure, which
    helps investors compare the Company’s operating performance
    with that of other companies. Real estate impairment losses have
    been excluded in deriving NOI because the Company does not
    consider its impairment losses to be a property operating
    expense. The Company believes that the exclusion of impairment
    losses from NOI is a common methodology used in the real estate
    industry. Real estate impairment losses relate to the changing
    values of the Company’s assets but do not reflect the
    current operating performance of the assets with respect to
    their revenues or expenses. The Company’s real estate
    impairment losses are non-cash charges which represent the write
    down in the value of assets when estimated fair value over the
    holding period is lower than current carrying value. The
    impairment charges were principally a result of increases in
    estimated capitalization rates and deterioration in market
    conditions that adversely impacted underlying real estate
    values. Therefore, the impairment charges are not related to the
    current performance of the Company’s real estate operations
    and should be excluded from its calculation of NOI.

In addition, the Company believes that NOI helps investors
    compare the operating performance of its real estate as compared
    to other companies. While NOI is a relevant and widely used
    measure of operating performance

of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash
    flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should
    not be considered as an alternative to those measures in
    evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating
    performance. NOI also does not reflect general and
    administrative expenses, interest expenses, real estate
    impairment losses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital
    expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and
    construction activities that could materially impact the
    Company’s results from operations. Further, the
    Company’s computation of NOI may not be comparable to that
    of other real estate companies, as they may use different
    methodologies for calculating NOI. For a reconciliation of NOI
    to net income, see the table below.

The following table is a reconciliation from NOI to reported net

    on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms
    of 1 to 54 years. The buildings and improvements subject to
    these ground leases are depreciated ratably over the lesser of
    the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum
    rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect
    as of December 31, 2009 were as follows (dollars in

Standby Letters of Credit.

As of

    $15.2 million in letters of credit, of which
    $12.8 million was provided under the Operating
    Partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit
    facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under
    certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other
    commitments.

Guarantees and Contribution
    Obligations.

Excluding parent guarantees
    associated with debt or contribution obligations as discussed in
    Notes 6, 7 and 13 as of December 31, 2009, the Company
    had outstanding guarantees and contribution obligations in the
    aggregate amount of $415.6 million as described below.

AMB
    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding bank
    guarantees in the amount of $0.4 million used to secure
    contingent obligations, primarily obligations under development
    and purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Company also guaranteed $47.9 million and
    $106.7 million on outstanding loans on six of its
    consolidated joint ventures and four of its unconsolidated joint
    ventures, respectively.

Also, the Company has entered into contribution agreements with
    its unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These contribution
    agreements require the Company to make additional capital
    contributions to the applicable co-investment venture upon
    certain defaults by the co-investment venture of certain of its
    debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital
    contributions will cover all or part of the applicable
    co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater
    than the Company’s share of the co-investment
    venture’s debt obligation or the value of its share of any
    property securing such debt. The Company’s contribution
    obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the
    amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the
    property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the
    lender upon default. The Company’s potential obligations
    under these contribution agreements totaled $260.6 million
    as of December 31, 2009.

Performance and Surety Bonds.

As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding performance
    and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $5.1 million.
    These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its
    development projects and were posted to guarantee certain
    property tax obligations and the construction of certain real
    property improvements and infrastructure. The performance and
    surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the
    property taxes due or the completion of the improvements and
    infrastructure.

Promote Interests and Other Contractual
    Obligations.

Upon the achievement of certain
    return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, the
    Company may be obligated to make payments to certain of its
    joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of
    their contractual agreements with the Operating Partnership.
    From time to time in the normal course of the Company’s
    business, the Company enters into various contracts with third
    parties that may obligate it to make payments, pay promotes or
    perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.

Contingencies

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Company may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a
    material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters.

The Company monitors
    its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic
    substances. The Company is not aware of any environmental
    liability with respect to the properties that would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business, assets
    or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance
    that such a material environmental liability does not exist. The
    existence of any such material environmental liability would
    have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations and cash flow. The Company carries environmental
    insurance and believes that the policy terms, conditions, limits
    and deductibles are adequate and appropriate under the
    circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the cost of such
    coverage and current industry practice.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Company carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood and terrorism
    insurance. The Company believes that the policy terms,
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and current industry practice. In
    addition, a significant number of the Company’s properties
    are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. As
    a result, the Company has obtained limited earthquake insurance
    on those properties. There are, however, certain types of
    extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts of war, that may
    be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although
    the Company has obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism,
    with policy specifications and insured limits that it believes
    are commercially reasonable, there can be no assurance that the

F-55

    PROPERTY CORPORATION AND AMB PROPERTY, L.P.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Company could lose its investment in,
    and anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property.

Captive Insurance Company.

The Company has a
    wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National
    Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for
    all or a portion of losses below the attachment point of the
    Company’s third-party insurance policies. The captive
    insurance company is one element of the Company’s overall
    risk management program. The Company capitalized Arcata in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    establishes annual premiums based on projections derived from
    the past loss experience at the Company’s properties. Like
    premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid
    to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific
    lease terms. Through this structure, the Company believes that
    it has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower
    cost than would otherwise be available in the market.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

Risk
    Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its
    business operations and economic conditions. The Company
    principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business
    and operational risks through management of its core business
    activities. The Company manages economic risks, including
    interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing
    the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the
    use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the
    Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage
    exposures that arise from business activities that result in the
    receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts,
    the value of which are determined by interest rates. The
    Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to
    manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the
    Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or
    expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s
    borrowings. The Company’s derivative financial instruments
    in effect at December 31, 2009 were one interest rate swap
    and two interest rate caps hedging cash flows of variable rate
    borrowings based on U.S. LIBOR.

Certain of the Company’s foreign operations expose the
    Company to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange
    rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of the
    Company’s cash receipts and payments in terms of the
    Company’s functional currency. The Company enters into
    derivative financial instruments to protect the value or fix the
    amount of certain obligations in terms of its functional
    currency, the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company had four currency forward contracts hedging intercompany
    loans.

Cash
    Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives
    are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its
    exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this
    objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and
    caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
    Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the
    receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange
    for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the
    agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
    Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the
    receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest
    rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for
    an upfront premium.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
    derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is
    recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a
    separate component of stockholders’ equity for the Parent
    Company and within partners’ capital for the Operating
    Partnership and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in
    the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects
    earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2009, such
    derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows
    associated with existing variable-rate borrowings.

Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)
    income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest
    expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s
    variable-rate borrowings. For the twelve months from
    December 31, 2009, the Company estimates that an additional
    $2.0 million will be reclassified as an increase to
    interest expense.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had the following
    outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as
    cash flow hedges of interest rate risk:

Non-designated
    Hedges

Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are
    used to manage the Company’s exposure to identified risks,
    such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, but do not
    meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of the accounting
    policy for derivative instruments and hedging activities. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company had four foreign currency
    forward contracts hedging intercompany loans and one interest
    rate cap hedging a construction loan and other variable rate
    borrowings which were not designated as hedges. Changes in the
    fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging
    relationships are recorded directly in earnings and are offset
    by changes in the fair value of the underlying assets or
    liabilities being hedged, which are also recorded in earnings.

Credit-risk-related
    Contingent Features

In order to limit the financial risks associated with derivative
    applications, the Company requires rigorous counterparty
    selection criteria and agreements to minimize counterparty risk
    for

over-the-counter

derivatives. For the Company’s derivatives, the
    counterparty is typically the same entity as, or an affiliate
    of, the lender.

The Company’s agreements with its derivative counterparties
    contain default and termination provisions related to the
    Company’s debt. If certain of the Company’s
    indebtedness (excluding its corporate lines of credit and
    intra-company indebtedness) in an amount in excess of three
    percent of the Company’s equity, as determined at the end
    of the last fiscal year, becomes, or becomes capable of being
    declared, due and payable earlier than it otherwise would have
    been, then the Company could also be declared in default on its
    derivative obligations. Also, if an event of default occurs
    under the Company’s corporate lines of credit and, as a
    result, amounts outstanding under such lines are declared or
    become due and payable in an amount in excess of three percent
    of the Company’s equity, as determined at the end of the
    last fiscal year, it shall constitute an additional termination
    event under the derivative contracts.

23.

Subsequent
    Events

Subsequent to year end, the Company’s two open-ended funds
    completed $267 million in net capital transactions
    consisting of: $50 million in new third-party equity in AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III; $67 million in
    investor-elected redemption withdrawals, thereby reducing AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III’s redemption queue to
    $14.9 million as of February 1, 2010; the
    Company’s $100 million investment in AMB Institutional
    Alliance Fund III; and its $50 million investment in
    AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company
    evaluated subsequent events occurring through February 19,
    2010, the date these financial statements were issued, in
    accordance with the Company’s policy related to disclosures
    of subsequent events.

ORGANIZATION

On September 17, 2003, AMB Property, L.P. formed AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, LLC (“Alliance
    Fund III, LLC”), a Delaware limited liability company.
    On October 25, 2004, AMB converted Alliance Fund III,
    LLC into a limited partnership, AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. (“Fund III”), a Delaware
    limited partnership, and admitted AMB Institutional Alliance
    REIT III, Inc. (“REIT III”) into Fund III as a
    limited partner. Due to the related party nature of the
    conversion, and that Fund III was under common control with
    Alliance Fund III, LLC, the assets and liabilities were
    accounted for by Fund III at historical cost.

On October 26, 2004 (“Inception”), Fund III
    completed its first closing and accepted capital contributions
    from AMB Property, L.P. and REIT III. On November 1, 2006,
    AMB Property II, L.P. was admitted to Fund III as a limited
    partner in exchange for a contribution of 16 industrial
    buildings with an estimated value of $111.9 million. On
    January 4, 2008, AMB HFC, L.P. was admitted to

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of Fund III and the ventures in
    which Fund III has a controlling interest. Third-party
    equity interests in Fund III’s ventures are reflected
    as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements. All significant intercompany amounts have
    been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to
    the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its
    estimated fair value.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local

airport authorities, and subject to ground leases are
    depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual
    term of the underlying ground lease. The estimated lives are as
    follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building costs on ground leases

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

Prior to January 1, 2009, the initial cost of buildings and
    improvements included the purchase price of the property or
    interest in the property including legal fees and acquisition
    costs. Pursuant to the Fund’s adoption of policies related
    to accounting for business combinations, legal fees and
    acquisition costs are now expensed and included in general and
    administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations.

Project costs associated with the development and construction
    of a real estate project, which include interest and property
    taxes, are capitalized as construction in progress. For the year
    ended December 31, 2009, Fund III capitalized interest
    and property taxes of approximately $0.4 million.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

Fund III records at acquisition an intangible asset or
    liability for the value attributable to above- or below-market
    leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2009, Fund III has recorded intangible
    assets or liabilities in the amounts of $12.7 million,
    $39.1 million, $38.2 million, and $78.1 million
    for the value attributable to above-market leases, below-market
    leases, in- place leases, and lease origination costs,
    respectively, which are included in buildings and improvements
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Fund III also records at acquisition an asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market assumed
    mortgage loans payable. As of December 31, 2009,
    Fund III has recorded $1.0 million for net above
    market assumed mortgage loans payable.

Real Estate Impairment Losses.

Carrying values
    for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on
    a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    When the carrying value of a property is greater than its
    estimated fair value, based on the intended use and holding
    period, an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the
    excess over its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The
    intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the
    long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured.
    If an asset is intended to be held for the long term, the
    impairment analysis is based on a two-step test. The first test
    measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding
    period, including a residual value (undiscounted and without
    interest charges), against the carrying value of the property.
    If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is
    measured against the lower of cost or the present value of
    expected cash flows over the expected hold period. An impairment
    charge to earnings is recognized for the excess of the
    asset’s carrying value over the lower of cost or the
    present value of expected cash flows over the expected hold
    period. If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is
    determined using the estimated fair value less costs to sell.
    The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently
    uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future
    economic and market conditions and the availability of capital.
    The management of Fund III determines estimated fair values
    based on its assumptions regarding rental rates,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices. As a result of the
    economic environment, the management of Fund III
    re-evaluated the carrying value of its investments and recorded
    impairment charges of $11.4 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 on certain of its investments.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Discontinued Operations.

Fund III reports
    its property sales as discontinued operations separately as
    prescribed under its policy of accounting for the disposal of
    long-lived assets, which requires Fund III to separately
    report as discontinued operations the historical operating
    results attributable to properties held for divestiture or
    operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the
    disposition of the properties. Although this application may
    affect the presentation of Fund III’s consolidated
    results of operations for the periods that it has already
    reported, there will be no effect on its previously reported
    consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows.

The following summarizes the condensed results of operations of
    the properties sold for the year ended December 31, 2009:

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with reserves from loan proceeds
    for certain capital improvements and real estate tax payments.
    Restricted cash also includes cash held by third parties as
    collateral for certain letters of credit. As of
    December 31, 2009, Fund III had two letters of credit
    outstanding totaling $0.2 million. These letters of credit
    are for security deposits on ground leases.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related mortgage loans payable. As of
    December 31, 2009, deferred financing costs were
    $6.8 million, net of accumulated amortization.

Mortgage Premiums and Discounts.

Mortgage
    premiums and discounts represent the difference between the fair
    value of debt and the principal value of debt assumed in
    connection with acquisitions. The mortgage premiums and
    discounts are being amortized into interest expense over the
    term of the related debt instrument using the effective-interest
    method. As of December 31, 2009, the net unamortized
    mortgage discounts were approximately $4.7 million.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent interests held by an affiliate of AMB and
    third-party investors in various Fund III entities. Such
    investments are consolidated because Fund III owns a
    majority interest and exercises control through the ability to
    control major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    Fund III are allocated to each of the partners in
    accordance with the partnership agreement. Partner
    distributions, if any, are made quarterly. Distributions, other
    than priority distributions (Note 8), are paid or accrued
    to each of the partners in accordance with their respective
    partnership units owned at the time distributions are declared.

On January 1, 2005, Fund III issued 125 Series A
    preferred units at a price of $1,000 per unit, which are held by
    REIT III. REIT III in turn issued 125 shares of
    Series A preferred stock at a price of $1,000 per share.
    The Series A preferred stock is 12.5 percent
    cumulative non-voting preferred stock, callable with a premium
    based on the period of time the stock has been outstanding. The
    call premium was 15.0 percent through December 31,
    2007. The

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

premium will reduce each year thereafter by 5.0 percent per
    year such that there will be no premium after December 31,
    2009. Dividends are payable on June 30 and December 31 of each
    year.

Rental Revenues.

Fund III, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. In addition, Fund III nets its bad debt
    expense against rental income for financial reporting purposes.
    Such amounts totaled approximately $2.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. Fund III recorded net
    $4.1 million of income related to amortization of lease
    intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2009. Of the
    net $4.1 million recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, $2.4 million relates to
    amortization expense of above-market leases and
    $6.5 million relates to amortization income of below-market
    leases, respectively. The lease intangibles are being amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Gains from Sale.

Gains and losses are
    recognized using the full accrual method. Gains related to
    transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full
    accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when
    the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with Fund III in
    its trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to
    occupy space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on Fund III’s ability to lease space
    and on the level of rent that can be achieved. As of
    December 31, 2009, Fund III did not have any material
    concentration of credit risk due to the diversification of its
    tenants.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

As of
    December 31, 2009, Fund III’s consolidated
    financial instruments include mortgage loans payable and a
    secured credit facility. Based on borrowing rates available to
    Fund III at December 31, 2009, the estimated fair
    value of the mortgage loans payable and the secured credit
    facility was $1.5 billion.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

Effective
    January 1, 2009, Fund III adopted policies related to
    accounting for business combinations, which changes the
    accounting for business combinations including the measurement
    of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business
    combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the
    accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
    accounting for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals,
    the treatment of acquisition-related transaction costs and the
    recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax
    valuation allowance. This adoption did not have a material
    effect on Fund III’s financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2009, Fund III adopted policies
    related to accounting for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as capital in
    the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
    adoption, Fund III has retroactively renamed the minority
    interests as noncontrolling interests and has reclassified these
    balances to the capital section of the consolidated balance
    sheet. In addition, on the consolidated statement of operations,
    the presentation of net loss retroactively includes the portion
    of income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance related to
    accounting for fair value measurements which define fair value
    and establish a framework for measuring fair value in order to
    meet disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Fair
    value is defined as the exchange price that would be received
    for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
    the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    on the measurement date. This guidance also establishes a fair
    value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels
    of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated
    balance sheet are categorized based on the inputs to the
    valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
    liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative
    contracts that are traded in an active exchange market.

Level 2.

Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities
    include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less
    frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative
    contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with
    inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This
    category generally includes certain corporate debt securities
    and derivative contracts.

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation. This
    category generally includes long-term derivative contracts and
    real estate.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, adjustments of $0
    and $1.6 million were recorded to estimated fair value of
    the Fund’s non financial assets and impairment charges,
    respectively, following the review for impairment. This adoption
    had no material impact on the Fund’s financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, in conjunction
    with a review for impairment, selected assets were adjusted to
    fair value and impairment charges were recorded. This adoption
    had no material impact on Fund III’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Effective June 2009, Fund III adopted a policy related to
    disclosures of subsequent events which involves accounting for
    and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
    but before financial statements are issued or are available to
    be issued. This adoption did not have any impact on the
    Fund III’s financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (“Codification”) which identifies the
    sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
    the principles used in the preparation of its financial
    statements that are presented in conformity with GAAP. Effective
    September 2009, Fund III has adopted the Codification,
    which did not have a material impact on Fund III’s
    financial statements.

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION/DISPOSITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2009, Fund III
    acquired two industrial buildings through an equity exchange
    totaling 428,180 square feet (unaudited). The total
    aggregate investment was approximately $32.5 million. The
    $32.5 million total purchase price related to these
    acquisitions was allocated $5.0 million to land,

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$22.1 million to buildings and improvements,
    $0.7 million to in-place leases, and $4.7 million to
    lease origination costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, Fund III
    disposed of six industrial buildings totaling
    529,971 square feet (unaudited), for an aggregate sales
    price of approximately $46.6 million, including
    $1.6 million of disposition costs. The dispositions
    resulted in net gains of approximately $1.3 million.

4.

DEBT

During the year ended December 31, 2009, Fund III
    repaid $28.7 million on one outstanding mortgage loan
    payable and $9.9 million on two outstanding mortgage loans
    payable in conjunction with the disposition of real estate. The
    loans bore interest at 7.50 percent, 7.31 percent and
    4.75 percent, respectively. In addition, Fund III used
    the sales proceeds from the dispositions to reduce
    $2.6 million of near-term mortgage loan maturities.

As of December 31, 2009, Fund III had a secured credit
    facility providing for loans in an initial principal amount
    outstanding of up to $65.0 million. The credit facility is
    secured by a pledge of the equity in AMB Mosaic Properties, LLC,
    a Special Purpose Entity (“SPE”) whose sole purpose is
    to own the AMB Mosaic properties. The Fund is a guarantor of the
    obligations under the facility. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, Fund III increased its borrowings
    on this facility by $38.9 million. The secured credit
    facility matures in September 2014 and $26.1 million bears
    interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 190 basis points
    (3.2 percent at December 31, 2009) and
    $38.9 million bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus
    225 basis points and cost of funds (3.4 percent at
    December 31, 2009). As of December 31, 2009, the
    outstanding balance on this secured credit facility was
    $65.0 million. The credit facility contains customary and
    other affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including
    financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specific
    ratios. The management of Fund III believes that it was in
    compliance with these financial covenants at December 31,
    2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, Fund III
    obtained one mortgage loan payable totaling $18.1 million.
    This loan bears interest at 5.48 percent and matures in
    2015.

As of December 31, 2009, Fund III had outstanding
    mortgage loans payable totaling $1.7 billion, not including
    net unamortized mortgage discounts of approximately
    $4.7 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.82 percent and mature between 2010 and
    2024.

The mortgage loans payable are collateralized by certain
    Properties and require monthly interest and principal payments
    until maturity. Certain of the mortgage loans payable are
    cross-collateralized. In addition, the mortgage loans payable
    have various covenants. Management of Fund III believes
    that Fund III was in compliance with these covenants at
    December 31, 2009.

As of December 31, 2009, certain Fund III mortgage
    loans payable require the existence of SPEs, whose sole purposes
    are to own AMB Baltimore Beltway, AMB Palmetto, AMB Spruce
    Avenue, AMB Zuma Distribution Center, Boston Marine, JFK
    Logistics Center, LAX Gateway and SEA Logistics Center 2,
    properties that collateralize 11 mortgage loans payable. All
    SPEs are consolidated in Fund III’s consolidated
    financial statements. The creditors of the SPEs do not have
    recourse to any other assets or revenues of Fund III or to
    AMB or its affiliated entities. Conversely, the creditors of AMB
    and its affiliated entities do not have recourse to any of the
    assets or revenues of the SPEs.

INCOME
    TAXES

As a partnership, the allocated share of income of Fund III
    is included in the income tax returns of the individual
    partners. Accordingly, no accounting for income taxes is
    required in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2008, Fund III adopted policies
    related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which
    clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
    positions, and such adoption did not have a material impact on
    Fund III.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, AMB receives
    acquisition fees equal to 0.9 percent of the acquisition
    cost of properties acquired. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, Fund III did not pay AMB any
    acquisition fees. Prior to January 1, 2009, acquisition
    fees were capitalized and included in investments in real estate
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Pursuant to the
    Fund’s adoption of policies related to accounting for
    business combinations, acquisition costs are now expensed and
    included in general and administrative expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

At certain of Alliance Fund III’s properties, AMB is
    responsible for the property management or the accounting or
    both. For properties which AMB provides both property management
    and accounting services, AMB earns fees between 0.5 percent
    and 4.5 percent of the respective property’s cash
    receipts. For properties where the property management service
    is provided by a third-party, AMB earns accounting fees between
    0.4 percent and 1.0 percent of the respective
    property’s cash receipts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, AMB earned combined property management
    and accounting fees of approximately $5.5 million.

At certain properties, AMB earns a leasing commission when it
    has acted as the listing broker or the procuring broker or both.
    For the year ended December 31, 2009, AMB earned leasing
    commissions of approximately $1.2 million.

At certain properties, AMB earns construction management fees
    when it has acted as the project manager. AMB earned
    construction management fees of approximately $0.4 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009.

On a quarterly basis, AMB, as general partner, receives priority
    distributions of 7.5 percent of net operating income
    (excluding straight-line rents, straight-line ground rent
    expense, and amortization of lease intangibles) for providing
    asset management services to Fund III. AMB earned
    approximately $13.2 million in priority distributions for
    the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31,
    2009, Fund III owed AMB $0.5 million in property

management and accounting fees, operating cash flow
    distributions, priority distributions, and other miscellaneous
    items, which is included in accounts payable and other
    liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Commencing January 1, 2009, AMB, as general partner,
    offered CCSFERS an opportunity to have a portion of the priority
    distribution otherwise payable to AMB effectively returned to
    CCSFERS because CCSFERS has invested capital in excess of
    $50.0 million in Fund III. Pursuant to its
    participation in this program and based on the amount of its
    invested capital in Fund III, $0.8 million of the
    priority distribution otherwise payable to AMB as general
    partner for the year ended December 31, 2009 was payable to
    CCSFERS. Investors that have invested capital in excess of
    $50.0 million in AMB Fund III Holdings, L.P.
    (“Fund III Holdings”) or REIT III (as opposed to
    Fund III directly) are similarly eligible to participate in
    this program through the profit sharing program available to
    investors in Fund III Holdings.

For renovation properties, AMB earns a quarterly fee equal to
    0.70 percent per annum of the respective property’s
    acquisition cost (as defined). Such renovation fees are payable
    in arrears over the property’s initial renovation period
    (as defined). For the year ended December 31, 2009, AMB
    earned renovation fees of approximately $0.1 million. Such
    renovation fees are capitalized and are included in investments
    in real estate in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Commencing June 30, 2008 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2009, a cumulative incentive distribution of $39.3 million
    has been earned by AMB.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third-party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include
    liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, and accrued
    but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
    business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to $3.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, Fund III may be involved in legal
    actions relating to the ownership and operations of its
    Properties. Management does not expect that the liabilities, if
    any, that may ultimately result from such legal actions would
    have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows of Fund III.

Environmental Matters.

Fund III follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. Fund III is not aware of
    any environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on Fund III’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on Fund III’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

Fund III
    carries property and rental loss, liability, flood,
    environmental and terrorism insurance. Fund III believes
    that the policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are
    adequate and appropriate under the circumstances, given the
    relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry
    practice. In addition, certain of Fund III’s
    properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
    activity; therefore, Fund III has obtained limited
    earthquake insurance on those properties. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts
    of war that may be either uninsurable or not economically
    insurable. Although Fund III has obtained coverage for
    certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and
    insured limits that Fund III believes are commercially
    reasonable, it is not certain that Fund III will be able to
    collect under such policies. Should an uninsured loss occur,
    Fund III could lose its investment in, and anticipated
    profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has adopted certain
    policies with respect to insurance coverage and proceeds as part
    of its operating policies, which apply to properties owned or
    managed by AMB, including properties owned by Fund III.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

In preparing the consolidated financial statements,
    Fund III evaluated subsequent events occurring through
    February 11, 2010, the date these financial statements were
    issued, in accordance with Fund III’s policy related
    to disclosures of subsequent events.

During January 2010, Fund III completed an equity closing
    totaling $50.0 million from REIT III and
    $100.0 million from AMB, which results in REIT III
    (including AMB Property L.P.’s interest), CCSFERS, and AMB
    ownership interests in Fund III of 50.8 percent,
    20.1 percent and 29.1 percent, respectively.
    AMB’s overall interest in Fund III is
    30.4 percent.

During January 2010, Fund III repaid $27.5 million on
    two outstanding mortgage loans payable and $38.9 million on
    a secured credit facility. The loans bore a weighted average
    interest rate of 6.2 percent and LIBOR plus 225 basis
    points and cost of funds (3.4 percent at December 31,
    2009), respectively.

Effective January 25, 2010 Fund III, REIT III and
    Fund III Holdings changed their legal names. These legal
    name changes do not involve a change of control or other change
    in the ownership percentages of these entities. All other
    Fund III related and subsidiary entities remain as is.
    Legal name changes are as follows:

To the Partners of

AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of
    partners’ capital and noncontrolling interests and of cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and
    its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Partnership”) at
    December 31, 2008, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
    the Partnership’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
    audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
    the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements, the
    Partnership adopted accounting standards related to
    noncontrolling interests effective January 1, 2009. All
    amounts have been reclassified herein to conform to 2009

ORGANIZATION

On September 17, 2003, AMB Property, L.P. formed AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, LLC (“Alliance
    Fund III, LLC”), a Delaware limited liability company.
    On October 25, 2004, AMB converted Alliance Fund III,
    LLC into a limited partnership, AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. (“Fund III”), a Delaware
    limited partnership, and admitted AMB Institutional Alliance
    REIT III, Inc. (“REIT III”) into Fund III as a
    limited partner. Due to the related party nature of the
    conversion, and that Fund III was under common control with
    Alliance Fund III, LLC, the assets and liabilities were
    accounted for by Fund III at historical cost.

On October 26, 2004 (“Inception”), Fund III
    completed its first closing and accepted capital contributions
    from AMB Property, L.P. and REIT III. On November 1, 2006,
    AMB Property II, L.P. (collectively with AMB Property, L.P.,
    “AMB”) was admitted to Fund III as a limited
    partner in exchange for a contribution of 16 industrial
    buildings with an estimated value of $111.9 million. On
    July 1, 2008, the City and County of San Francisco
    Employees’ Retirement System (“CCSFERS”) and AMB
    contributed their partnership interests in AMB Partners II, L.P.
    (“Partners II”) to Fund III in exchange for
    partnership interests in Fund III. As of December 31,
    2008, Fund III has accepted capital contributions from AMB,
    CCSFERS and REIT III (excluding AMB Property, L.P.’s
    interest), and contributions resulting from Fund III’s
    dividend reinvestment program, for ownership interests in
    Fund III of 19.4 percent, 25.5 percent and
    55.1 percent, respectively. AMB is a general and limited
    partner of Fund III. As of December 31, 2008, all
    capital balances reflect balances at liquidation value.

As of December 31, 2008, $56.6 million of REIT III
    units in Fund III have been redeemed.

As of December 31, 2008, Fund III owned 128 operating
    properties and one renovation property (consisting of 310
    industrial buildings aggregating 37.0 million square feet
    (unaudited)) and one parcel of land held for future development
    (the “Properties”). The Properties are located in the
    following markets: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore/Washington DC,
    Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, Northern New
    Jersey/New York, Orlando, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle,
    South Florida, and Southern California.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of Fund III and the ventures in
    which Fund III has a controlling interest. Third party
    equity interests in Fund III’s ventures are reflected
    as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements. All significant intercompany amounts have
    been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of Fund III’s long-lived assets could occur in
    the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent
    that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount
    of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

income and is included on the consolidated statement of
    operations. As a result of the economic environment, the
    management of Fund III re-evaluated the carrying value of
    its investments and recorded impairment charges of
    $8.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local airport
    authorities, and subject to ground leases are depreciated over
    the lesser of 40 years or the contractual term of the
    underlying ground lease. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building costs on ground leases

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in property including
    legal fees and acquisition costs. Project costs associated with
    the development and construction of a real estate project, which
    include interest and property taxes, are capitalized as
    construction in progress. For the year ended December 31,
    2008, Fund III capitalized interest and property taxes of
    approximately $0.3 million.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

Fund III records at acquisition an intangible asset or
    liability for the value attributable to above- or below-market
    leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2008, Fund III has recorded intangible
    assets or liabilities in the amounts of $12.6 million,
    $42.1 million, $37.8 million, and $73.6 million
    for the value attributable to above-market leases, below-market
    leases, in-place leases, and lease origination costs,
    respectively, which are included in buildings and improvements
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Fund III also records at acquisition an asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market assumed
    mortgage loans payable. As of December 31, 2008,
    Fund III has recorded $0.9 million for net above
    market assumed mortgage loans payable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with reserves from loan proceeds
    for certain capital improvements and real estate tax payments.
    Restricted cash also includes cash held by third parties as
    collateral for certain letters of credit. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Partnership had two letters of
    credit outstanding totaling $0.2 million. These letters of
    credit are for security deposits on ground leases.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related mortgage loans payable. As of
    December 31, 2008, deferred financing costs were
    $9.2 million, net of accumulated amortization.

Mortgage Premiums and Discounts.

Mortgage
    premiums and discounts represent the difference between the fair
    value of debt and the principal value of debt assumed in
    connection with acquisitions. The mortgage premiums and
    discounts are being amortized into interest expense over the
    term of the related debt instrument using the effective-interest
    method. As of December 31, 2008, the net unamortized
    mortgage discounts were approximately $4.4 million.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent interests held by an affiliate of AMB and
    third-party investors in various Fund III entities. Such
    investments are consolidated because Fund III owns a
    majority interest and exercises control through the ability to
    control major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    Fund III are allocated to each of the partners in
    accordance with the partnership agreement. Partner distributions
    are made quarterly. Distributions, other than priority
    distributions (Note 8), are paid or accrued to each of the
    partners in accordance with their respective partnership units
    owned at the time distributions are declared.

On January 1, 2005, Fund III issued 125 Series A
    preferred units at a price of $1,000 per unit, which are held by
    REIT III. REIT III in turn issued 125 shares of
    Series A preferred stock at a price of $1,000 per share.
    The Series A preferred stock is 12.5 percent
    cumulative non-voting preferred stock, callable with a premium
    based on the period of time the stock has been outstanding. The
    call premium was 15.0 percent through December 31,
    2007. The premium will reduce each year thereafter by
    5.0 percent per year such that there will be no premium
    after December 31, 2009. Dividends are payable on June 30
    and December 31 of each year.

Rental Revenues.

Fund III, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. In addition, Fund III nets its bad debt
    expense against rental income for financial reporting purposes.
    Such amounts totaled approximately $0.9 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. Fund III recorded net
    $3.7 million of income related to amortization of lease
    intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2008. Of the
    net $3.7 million recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, $3.0 million relates to
    amortization expense of above-market leases and
    $6.7 million relates to amortization income of below-market
    leases, respectively. The lease intangibles are being amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with Fund III in
    its trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to
    occupy space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on Fund III’s ability to lease space
    and on the level of rent that can be achieved. As of
    December 31, 2008, Fund III did not have any material
    concentration of credit risk due to the diversification of its
    tenants.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

As of
    December 31, 2008, Fund III’s consolidated
    financial instruments include mortgage loans payable, a secured
    credit facility and an unsecured credit facility. Based on
    borrowing rates available to Fund III at December 31,
    2008, the estimated fair value of the mortgage loans payable,
    secured credit facility and unsecured credit facility was
    $1.7 billion.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In December
    2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued a policy which changes the accounting
    for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer
    shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the
    recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for
    preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, the accounting for
    acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment
    of acquisition-related transaction costs and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.
    Fund III is in the process of evaluating the impact that
    the adoption of this policy will have on its financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows, but, at a minimum, it will
    require the expensing of transaction costs.

In December 2007, the FASB issued a policy which clarifies that
    a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership
    interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as
    equity in the consolidated financial statements. This Statement
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008.

AMB

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In March 2008, the FASB issued a policy which requires entities
    to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an
    entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and
    (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    affect an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance and cash flows. This policy is effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2008. Fund III is in the process of
    evaluating the impact of the adoption of this policy.

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Fund III
    acquired 141 industrial buildings totaling
    15,657,271 square feet (unaudited). The total aggregate
    investment was approximately $1.4 billion, which includes
    approximately $6.4 million in closing costs and acquisition
    fees related to these acquisitions. The $1.3 billion total
    purchase price related to these acquisitions was allocated
    $480.8 million to land, $817.9 million to buildings
    and improvements, $9.1 million to in-place leases,
    $39.6 million to lease origination costs, $5.2 million
    to above-market lease assets, $4.0 million to below-market
    lease liabilities, and $0.5 million to a below-market
    assumed mortgage loan payable.

4.

DEBT

As of December 31, 2008, Fund III had an unsecured
    revolving credit facility providing for loans in an initial
    principal amount outstanding of up to $110.0 million.
    Fund III guarantees the obligations under the credit
    facility pursuant to the revolving credit agreement.
    Fund III intends to use the facility to finance its real
    estate acquisition activity. The credit facility matures in
    December 2011 and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus
    160 basis points (2.0 percent at December 31,
    2008). In addition, there is an annual administration fee of
    $20,000 per year, payable quarterly in arrears. As of
    December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on this credit
    facility was $40.0 million. The credit facility contains
    customary and other affirmative covenants and negative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specific ratios. The management of Fund III
    believes that it was in compliance with these financial
    covenants at December 31, 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Fund III
    obtained a secured credit facility providing for loans in an
    initial principal amount outstanding of up to
    $65.0 million. The credit facility is secured by a pledge
    of the equity in AMB Mosaic Properties, LLC. The secured credit
    facility matures in September 2015 and bears interest at a rate
    of LIBOR plus 190 basis points (2.3 percent at
    December 31, 2008). As of December 31, 2008, the
    outstanding balance on this secured credit facility was
    $26.1 million. The credit facility contains customary and
    other affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including
    financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specific
    ratios. The management of Fund III believes that it was in
    compliance with these financial covenants at December 31,
    2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Fund III
    obtained 16 mortgage loans payable totaling $510.1 million.
    These loans bear interest at a weighted average rate of
    5.94 percent and mature between 2010 and 2018.

In conjunction with the contribution of Partners II,
    Fund III assumed 25 mortgage loans payable totaling
    $379.4 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.96 percent and mature between 2009 and
    2024.

As of December 31, 2008, Fund III had 74 mortgage
    loans payable totaling $1.8 billion, not including net
    unamortized mortgage discounts of approximately
    $4.4 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.55 percent and mature between 2009 and
    2024.

The mortgage loans payable are collateralized by certain of the
    Properties and require monthly interest and principal payments
    until maturity. Certain of the mortgage loans payable are
    cross-collateralized. In addition, the mortgage loans payable
    have various covenants. Management of Fund III believes
    that Fund III was in compliance with these covenants at
    December 31, 2008.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2008, certain Fund III mortgage
    loans payable require the existence of Special Purpose Entities
    (“SPEs”) whose sole purposes are to own AMB Baltimore
    Beltway, the AMB Mosaic properties, AMB Palmetto, AMB Spruce
    Avenue, AMB Zuma Distribution Center, Boston Marine, JFK
    Logistics Center, LAX Gateway and SEA Logistics Center 2,
    properties that collateralize 11 mortgage loans payable. All
    SPEs are consolidated in Fund III’s consolidated
    financial statements. The creditors of the SPEs do not have
    recourse to any other assets or revenues of Fund III or to
    AMB or its affiliated entities. Conversely, the creditors of AMB
    and its affiliated entities do not have recourse to any of the
    assets or revenues of the SPEs.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, AMB receives
    acquisition fees equal to 0.9 percent of the acquisition
    cost of properties acquired. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, Fund III paid AMB acquisition fees
    of approximately $1.6 million. Acquisition fees are
    capitalized and included in investments in real estate in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

At certain properties, AMB is responsible for the property
    management or the accounting or both. On a monthly basis, AMB
    earns property management fees between 0.35 percent and
    3.50 percent of the respective property’s cash
    receipts. On a monthly basis, AMB earns accounting fees between
    0.15 percent and 1.20 percent of the respective
    property’s cash receipts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, AMB earned property management and
    accounting fees of approximately $3.1 million.

At certain properties, AMB earns a leasing commission when it
    has acted as the listing broker or the procuring broker or both.
    For the year ended December 31, 2008, AMB earned leasing
    commissions of approximately $0.2 million.

On a quarterly basis, AMB, as general partner, receives priority
    distributions of 7.5 percent of net operating income
    (excluding straight-line rents, straight-line ground rent
    expense, and amortization of lease intangibles) for providing
    asset management services to Fund III. AMB earned
    approximately $12.2 million in priority distributions for
    the year ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31,
    2008, AMB owed Fund III $0.1 million in operating cash
    flow distributions, priority distributions, and other
    miscellaneous items, which is included in accounts receivable
    and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

S-34


AMB
    INSTITUTIONAL ALLIANCE FUND III, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For renovation properties, AMB earns a quarterly fee equal to
    0.70 percent per annum of the respective property’s
    acquisition cost (as defined). Such renovation fees are payable
    in arrears over the property’s initial renovation period
    (as defined). For the year ended December 31, 2008, AMB
    earned renovation fees of $12,000. Such renovation fees are
    capitalized and are included in investments in real estate in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Commencing June 30, 2008 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2008, an incentive distribution of $39.3 million has been
    earned by AMB.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include
    liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, accrued but
    unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to $2.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, Fund III may be involved in legal
    actions relating to the ownership and operations of its
    Properties. Management does not expect that the liabilities, if
    any, that may ultimately result from such legal actions would
    have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows of Fund III.

Environmental Matters.

Fund III follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. Fund III is not aware of
    any environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on Fund III’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on Fund III’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

Fund III
    carries property and rental loss, liability, flood,
    environmental and terrorism insurance. Fund III believes
    that the policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are
    adequate and appropriate under the circumstances, given the
    relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry
    practice. In addition, certain of Fund III’s
    properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
    activity; therefore, Fund III has obtained limited
    earthquake insurance on those properties. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts
    of war that may be either uninsurable or not economically
    insurable. Although Fund III has obtained coverage for
    certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and
    insured limits that Fund III believes are commercially
    reasonable, it is not certain that Fund III will be able to
    collect under such policies. Should an uninsured loss occur,
    Fund III could lose its investment in, and anticipated
    profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has adopted certain
    policies with respect to insurance coverage and proceeds as part
    of its operating policies, which apply to properties owned or
    managed by AMB, including properties owned by Fund III.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

On February 4, 2009, two properties were added to AMB
    Mosaic Properties, LLC. A pledge of the equity in AMB Mosaic
    Properties, LLC secures a credit facility providing for loans in
    an initial principal amount outstanding of up to
    $65.0 million, which Fund III obtained during the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

11.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Effective January 1, 2009, Fund III adopted policies
    related to accounting for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as capital in
    the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
    adoption, Fund III has retroactively renamed the minority
    interests as noncontrolling interests and has reclassified these
    balances to the capital section of the consolidated balance
    sheet. In addition, on the consolidated statement of operations,
    the presentation of net income retroactively includes the
    portion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

ORGANIZATION

On September 17, 2003, AMB Property, L.P. formed AMB
    Institutional Alliance Fund III, LLC (“Alliance
    Fund III, LLC”), a Delaware limited liability company.
    On October 25, 2004, AMB converted Alliance Fund III,
    LLC into a limited partnership, AMB Institutional Alliance
    Fund III, L.P. (“Fund III”), a Delaware
    limited partnership, and admitted AMB Institutional Alliance
    REIT III, Inc. (“REIT III”) into Fund III as a
    limited partner. Due to the related party nature of the
    conversion, and that Fund III was under common control with
    Alliance Fund III, LLC, the assets and liabilities were
    accounted for by Fund III at historical cost.

On October 26, 2004 (“Inception”), Fund III
    completed its first closing and accepted capital contributions
    from AMB Property, L.P. and REIT III. On November 1, 2006,
    AMB Property II, L.P. (collectively with AMB Property, L.P.,
    “AMB”) was admitted to Fund III as a limited
    partner in exchange for a contribution of 16 industrial
    buildings with an estimated value of $111.9 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, Fund III has accepted capital
    contributions from AMB and REIT III, and contributions resulting
    from Fund III’s dividend reinvestment program, for
    ownership interests in Fund III of 15.2 percent and
    84.8 percent, respectively. AMB is a general and limited
    partner of Fund III.

As of December 31, 2007, Fund III owned 80 operating
    properties consisting of 169 industrial buildings aggregating
    21.4 million square feet (unaudited) (the
    “Properties”). The Properties are located in the
    following markets: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore/Washington DC,
    Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, Northern New
    Jersey/New York, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, South
    Florida, and Southern California.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of Fund III and the joint
    ventures in which Fund III has a controlling interest.
    Third party equity interests in Fund III’s joint
    ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements. All significant
    intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of Fund III’s long-lived assets could occur in
    the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent
    that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount
    of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to
    income and is included on the consolidated statement of
    operations. The management of Fund III believes that there
    were no impairments of the carrying values of its investments in
    real estate as of December 31, 2007.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are located on-tarmac,
    which is land owned by federal, state or local

airport authorities, and subject to ground leases are
    depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual
    term of the underlying ground lease. The estimated lives are as
    follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building costs on ground leases

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Plumbing/signage

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in property including
    legal fees and acquisition costs. Project costs associated with
    the development and construction of a real estate project, which
    include interest and property taxes, are capitalized as
    construction in progress. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, Fund III capitalized interest and property taxes of
    approximately $0.1 million.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

Fund III records at acquisition an intangible asset or
    liability for the value attributable to above- or below-market
    leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2007, Fund III has recorded intangible
    assets or liabilities in the amounts of $7.4 million,
    $38.1 million, $28.8 million, and $34.0 million
    for the value attributable to above-market leases, below-market
    leases, in-place leases, and lease origination costs,
    respectively, which are included in buildings and improvements
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Fund III also records at acquisition an asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market assumed
    mortgage loans payable. As of December 31, 2007,
    Fund III has recorded $3.8 million for net above
    market assumed mortgage loans payable.

Discontinued Operations.

Fund III reports
    its property sales as prescribed under its policy of accounting
    for the disposal of long-lived assets, which requires
    Fund III to separately report as discontinued operations
    the historical operating results attributable to properties held
    for divestiture or operating properties sold and the applicable
    gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. Although this
    application may affect the presentation of Fund III’s
    consolidated results of operations for the periods that it has
    already reported, there will be no effect on its previously
    reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash
    flows.

    the properties sold for the year ended December 31, 2007:

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow in connection with reserves from loan proceeds
    for certain capital improvements and real estate tax payments.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related mortgage loans payable. As of
    December 31, 2007, deferred financing costs were
    $6.5 million, net of accumulated amortization.

Mortgage Premiums.

Mortgage premiums represent
    the excess of the fair value of debt over the principal value of
    debt assumed in connection with acquisitions. The mortgage
    premiums are being amortized into interest expense over the term
    of the related debt instrument using the effective- interest
    method. As of December 31, 2007, the unamortized mortgage
    premiums were approximately $1.5 million.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent interests held by an affiliate of AMB and
    third-party investors in various Fund III entities. Such
    investments are consolidated because Fund III owns a
    majority interest and exercises significant control through the
    ability to control major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    Fund III are allocated to each of the partners in
    accordance with the partnership agreement. Partner distributions
    are made quarterly. Distributions, other than priority
    distributions (Note 8), are paid or accrued to each of the
    partners in accordance with their respective partnership units
    owned at the time distributions are declared.

On January 1, 2005, Fund III issued 125 Series A
    preferred units at a price of $1,000 per unit, which are held by
    REIT III. REIT III in turn issued 125 shares of
    Series A preferred stock at a price of $1,000 per share.
    The Series A preferred stock is 12.5 percent
    cumulative non-voting preferred stock, callable with a premium
    based on the period of time the stock has been outstanding. The
    call premium was 15.0 percent through December 31,
    2007. The premium will reduce each year thereafter by
    5.0 percent per year such that there will be no premium
    after December 31, 2009. Dividends are payable on June 30
    and December 31 of each year.

Rental Revenues.

Fund III, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. In addition, Fund III nets its bad debt
    expense against rental income for financial reporting purposes.
    Such amount totaled approximately $1.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007. Fund III recorded net
    $2.3 million of income to rental revenues related to
    amortization of lease intangibles for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Of the net $2.3 million recorded
    for the year ended December 31, 2007, $2.0 million
    relates to amortization expense of above-market leases, and
    $4.3 million relates to amortization income of below-market
    leases, respectively. The lease intangibles are being amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with Fund III in
    its trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to
    occupy space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on Fund III’s ability to lease space
    and on the level of rent that can be achieved. As of
    December 31, 2007, Fund III did not have any material
    concentration of credit risk due to the diversification of its
    tenants.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

As of
    December 31, 2007, Fund III’s consolidated
    financial instruments include mortgage loans payable and an
    unsecured note payable. Based on borrowing rates available to
    Fund III at December 31, 2007, the estimated fair
    market value of the mortgage loans payable and unsecured note
    payable was $974.6 million. Management of Fund III
    believes that those mortgage loans payable with short maturities
    or variable interest rates approximate fair value.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In July 2006,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    issued a policy which clarifies the accounting and disclosure
    for uncertainty in tax positions, as defined. This policy seeks

S-44


AMB
    INSTITUTIONAL ALLIANCE FUND III, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain
    aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting
    for income taxes. Adoption of this policy on January 1,
    2007 did not have a material effect on Fund III.

In September 2006, the FASB issued a policy which defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This policy
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. Fund III does not believe that
    the adoption of this policy will have a material impact on its
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued a policy which permits
    entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value and establishes
    presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
    comparisons between entities that choose different measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. This
    policy is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
    year beginning after November 15, 2007. Fund III does
    not believe that the adoption of this policy will have a
    material impact on its financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Fund III
    acquired 49 industrial buildings totaling 7,425,913 square
    feet (unaudited). The total aggregate investment was
    approximately $633.7 million, which includes approximately
    $8.9 million in closing costs and acquisition fees related
    to these acquisitions. The $606.7 million total purchase
    price related to these acquisitions was allocated
    $244.3 million to land, $358.0 million to buildings
    and improvements, $8.7 million to in-place leases,
    $13.7 million to lease origination costs, $0.1 million
    to above-market lease assets, and $18.1 million to
    below-market lease liabilities.

4.

DEBT

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Fund III
    increased the capacity of its existing unsecured revolving
    credit facility providing for loans in an initial principal
    amount outstanding from $60.0 million up to
    $110.0 million. Fund III guarantees the obligations
    under the credit facility pursuant to the revolving credit
    agreement. Fund III intends to use the facility to finance
    its real estate acquisition activity. The credit facility
    matures in December 2011 and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR
    plus 160 basis points (6.20 percent at
    December 31, 2007). In addition, there is an annual
    administration fee of $20,000 per year, payable quarterly in
    arrears. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance
    on this credit facility was $70.0 million. The credit
    facility contains customary and other affirmative covenants and
    negative covenants, including financial reporting requirements
    and maintenance of specific ratios. The management of
    Fund III believes that it was in compliance with these
    financial covenants at December 31, 2007.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Fund III
    obtained an unsecured note payable in the amount of
    $16.0 million. This note payable bears interest at a fixed
    rate of 6.2 percent and matures in October 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Fund III
    obtained eight mortgage loans payable totaling
    $354.3 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.93 percent and mature between 2015 and
    2017.

As of December 31, 2007, Fund III had 29 mortgage
    loans payable totaling $960.5 million, not including
    unamortized mortgage premiums of approximately
    $1.5 million. These loans bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.80 percent and mature between 2009 and
    2017.

The mortgage loans payable are collateralized by certain of the
    Properties and require monthly interest and principal payments
    until maturity. Certain of the mortgage loans payable are
    cross-collateralized. In addition, the mortgage loans payable
    have various covenants. Management of Fund III believes
    that Fund III was in compliance with these covenants at
    December 31, 2007.

    (Continued)

During the year ended December 31, 2007, Fund III also
    borrowed and repaid $33.1 million in the form of a
    collateralized note payable to AMB. The note bore interest at a
    rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points (6.60 percent at
    December 31, 2007), which totaled approximately $44,000 for
    the year ended December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, certain Fund III mortgage
    loans payable require the existence of Special Purpose Entities
    (“SPEs”) whose sole purposes are to own AMB Baltimore
    Beltway, AMB Spruce Avenue, AMB Zuma Distribution Center, Boston
    Marine, and four buildings at JFK Logistics Center, properties
    that collateralize seven mortgage loans payable. All SPEs are
    consolidated in Fund III’s consolidated financial
    statements. The creditors of the SPEs do not have recourse to
    any other assets or revenues of Fund III or to AMB or its
    affiliated entities. Conversely, the creditors of AMB and its
    affiliated entities do not have recourse to any of the assets or
    revenues of the SPEs.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

Pursuant to the Amended Partnership Agreement, AMB receives
    acquisition fees equal to 0.9 percent of the acquisition
    cost of properties acquired. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, Fund III paid AMB acquisition fees
    of approximately $4.3 million. Acquisition fees are
    capitalized and included in investments in real estate in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

At certain properties, AMB is responsible for the property
    management or the accounting or both. On a monthly basis, AMB
    earns property management fees between 1.05 percent and
    2.6 percent of the respective property’s cash
    receipts. On a monthly basis, AMB earns accounting fees between
    0.22 percent and 1.0 percent of the respective
    property’s cash receipts. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, AMB earned property management and
    accounting fees of approximately $1.7 million.

At certain properties, AMB earns a leasing commission when it
    has acted as the listing broker or the procuring broker or both.
    For the year ended December 31, 2007, AMB earned leasing
    commissions of approximately $0.1 million.

On a quarterly basis, AMB, as general partner, receives priority
    distributions of 7.5 percent of net operating income
    (excluding straight-line rents, straight-line ground rent
    expense, and amortization of lease intangibles) for providing
    asset management services to Fund III. AMB earned approximately
    $7.3 million in priority distributions for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007,
    Fund III owed AMB $0.2 million in operating cash flow
    distributions, priority distributions, and other miscellaneous
    items, which is included in accounts payable and other
    liabilities and distributions payable in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.

For renovation properties, AMB earns a quarterly fee equal to
    0.70 percent per annum of the respective property’s
    acquisition cost (as defined). Such renovation fees are payable
    in arrears over the property’s initial renovation period
    (as defined). For the year ended December 31, 2007, AMB did
    not earn any renovation fees. Such renovation fees are
    capitalized and are included in investments in real estate in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

AMB
    INSTITUTIONAL ALLIANCE FUND III, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Commencing June 30, 2008 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2007, no incentive distribution has been earned by AMB.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Unknown liabilities may include liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, accrued but
    unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to $2.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, Fund III may be involved in legal
    actions relating to the ownership and operations of its
    Properties. Management does not expect that the liabilities, if
    any, that may ultimately result from such legal actions would
    have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows of Fund III.

Environmental Matters.

Fund III follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. Fund III is not aware of
    any environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on Fund III’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on Fund III’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

Fund III
    carries property and rental loss, liability, flood,
    environmental and terrorism insurance. Fund III believes
    that the policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are
    adequate and appropriate under the circumstances, given the
    relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry
    practice. In addition, certain of Fund III’s
    properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
    activity; therefore, Fund III has obtained limited
    earthquake insurance on those properties. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts
    of war that may be either uninsurable or not economically
    insurable. Although Fund III has obtained coverage for
    certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and
    insured limits that Fund III believes are commercially
    reasonable, it is not certain that Fund III will be able to
    collect under such policies. Should an uninsured loss occur,
    Fund III could lose its investment in, and anticipated
    profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has adopted certain
    policies with respect to insurance coverage and proceeds as part
    of its operating policies, which apply to properties owned or
    managed by AMB, including properties owned by Fund III.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

On January 3, 2008, Fund III completed an equity
    closing totaling $50.0 million from REIT III, which results
    in REIT III and AMB ownership interests in Fund III of
    85.5 percent and 14.5 percent, respectively.
    AMB’s overall interest in Fund III is
    16.9 percent.

    (Continued)

On January 4, 2008, Fund III acquired two industrial
    buildings totaling 1,003,229 square feet (unaudited) for a
    total purchase price of approximately $86.8 million.

On January 10, 2008, Fund III repaid
    $50.0 million of the unsecured revolving credit facility,
    which had an outstanding balance of $70.0 million as of
    December 31, 2007.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Effective January 1, 2009, Fund III adopted policies
    related to accounting for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as capital in
    the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
    adoption, Fund III has retroactively renamed the minority
    interests as noncontrolling interests and has reclassified these
    balances to the capital section of the consolidated balance
    sheet. In addition, on the consolidated statement of operations,
    the presentation of net income retroactively includes the
    portion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Partners of

AMB Japan Fund I, L.P.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of
    partners’ capital and noncontrolling interests and of cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the
    “Partnership”) and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (denominated in Yen). These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Partnership’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
    audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
    obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Partnership changed the manner in which it
    accounted for noncontrolling interests in 2009 and has
    retroactively reclassified the 2008 consolidated balance sheet
    and consolidated statement of operations to conform to the
    current year presentation.

AMB JAPAN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008

1.

ORGANIZATION

On May 19, 2005, AMB Japan Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Japan”) and AMB Property II, L.P. as limited partner,
    formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the “Fund”), a
    Cayman Islands-exempted limited partnership. On June 30,
    2005 (“Inception”), 13 institutional investors were
    admitted as limited partners to the Fund and AMB Property II,
    L.P. withdrew as a limited partner.

The limited partners collectively committed ¥
    49.5 billion in equity to the Fund and AMB Japan, as
    general partner, committed ¥ 0.5 billion in equity to
    the Fund. In addition, AMB Property Singapore Pte. Ltd.
    (“AMB Singapore”) committed ¥ 11.9 billion
    in equity to co-invest with the Fund in properties. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Fund completed eight capital calls
    totaling ¥ 49.5 billion and ¥ 0.5 billion
    from the limited partners and general partner, respectively, of
    which non-cash contributions from the general partner totaled
    ¥ 0.4 billion.

The Fund and AMB Singapore co-invest (80.81 percent and
    19.19 percent, respectively) in Singapore private limited
    companies (“PTEs”) which indirectly own industrial
    real estate in Japan. The properties are owned individually in
    Japanese Tokutei Mokuteki Kaishas (“TMKs”). TMKs are
    asset-backed entities subject to tax on income net of
    distributions. Distributions from TMKs to non-residents are
    subject to local withholding taxes.

As of December 31, 2009, the Fund indirectly owned
    80.81 percent of 27 operating buildings (the
    “Properties”) aggregating approximately
    7.3 million square feet (unaudited). The Properties are
    located in the Fukuoka market, the Chiba, Funabashi, Kashiwa,
    Kawasaki, Narita, Narashino, Ohta, Sagamihara and Saitama
    submarkets of Tokyo, and the Amagasaki submarket of Osaka.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America (“U.S. GAAP”) in Yen currency. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the
    Fund and the ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s
    ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements. All significant
    intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Functional and Reporting Currency.

The Yen is
    both the functional and reporting currency for the Fund’s
    operations. Functional currency is the currency of the primary
    economic environment in which the Fund operates. Monetary assets
    and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Yen are
    remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to
    the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its
    estimated fair value.

S-56


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    investments in real estate. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

Prior to January 1, 2009, the initial cost of buildings and
    improvements included the purchase price of the property or
    interest in the property including legal fees and acquisition
    costs. Pursuant to the Fund’s adoption of policies related
    to accounting for business combinations, legal fees and
    acquisition costs are now expensed and included in general and
    administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

The Fund records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Fund has recorded
    ¥ 553.4 million, ¥ 1.7 billion, and
    ¥ 332.9 million for the value attributable to
    below-market leases, in-place leases, and lease origination
    costs, respectively, which are included in buildings and
    improvements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Fund had recorded intangible
    assets and liabilities in the amounts of ¥
    553.4 million, ¥ 1.5 billion, and ¥
    235.0 million for the value attributable to below-market
    leases, in-place leases, and lease origination costs,
    respectively, which are included in buildings and improvements
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Real Estate Impairment Losses.

Carrying values
    for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on
    a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    When the carrying value of a property is greater than its
    estimated fair value, based on the intended use and holding
    period, an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the
    excess over its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The
    intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the
    long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured.
    If an asset is intended to be held for the long term, the
    impairment analysis is based on a two-step test. The first test
    measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding
    period, including a residual value (undiscounted and without
    interest charges), against the carrying value of the property.
    If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is
    measured against the lower of cost (net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization) or the present value of expected
    cash flows over the expected hold period. An impairment charge
    to earnings is recognized for the excess of the asset’s
    carrying value over the lower of cost (net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization) or the present value of expected
    cash flows over the expected hold period. If an asset is
    intended to be sold, impairment is determined using the
    estimated fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of
    expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and
    relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and
    market conditions and the availability of capital. The
    management of the Fund determines estimated fair values based on
    its assumptions regarding rental rates,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices. The management of the
    Fund believes that there were no impairments of the carrying
    values of its investments in real estate as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    reserves required to be held pursuant to agreements with Chuo
    Mitsui Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., JP Morgan
    Trust Bank, Ltd. (“JP Morgan”), Sumitomo Mitsui
    Banking

S-57


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Corporation, Shinsei Bank, Limited, and Mitsubishi UFJ Lease,
    Finance Company Limited, GE Real Estate Corporation Japan and PK
    Airfinance Japan Limited, as well as cash held in escrow under
    the terms of the loan agreement with JP Morgan. Pursuant to
    these agreements, minimum levels of cash are required to be held
    as reserves for operating expenses, real estate taxes and
    insurance reserves, security deposits, maintenance reserves and
    periodic withholding of collections for debt servicing.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related debt. As of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, deferred financing costs were ¥ 689.5 million
    and ¥ 798.9 million, respectively, net of accumulated
    amortization.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities.

Based on
    the Fund’s policies of accounting for derivatives and
    hedging activities, the Fund records all derivatives on the
    balance sheet at fair value. All of the Fund’s derivatives
    are designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to
    variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of
    forecasted transactions, and are considered cash flow hedges.
    Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the
    timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument
    with the recognition of the earnings effect of the hedged
    forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The Fund
    reports other comprehensive income (loss) in its consolidated
    statements of partners’ capital and noncontrolling
    interests. Other comprehensive loss was ¥ 66.3 million
    and ¥ 580.3 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Mortgage and Bond Premiums.

Mortgage and bond
    premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt over the
    principal value of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions.
    The mortgage and bond premiums are being amortized into interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the unamortized mortgage and bond premiums were
    approximately ¥ 16.9 million and ¥
    30.4 million, respectively.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent a 19.19 percent indirect equity
    interest in the Properties held by AMB Singapore. Such
    investments are consolidated because the Fund owns a majority
    interest and exercises significant control through the ability
    to control major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Fund are allocated to each of the partners in accordance
    with the Fund’s partnership agreement. Partner
    distributions are expected to be made when distributable
    proceeds are available after taking into account the Fund’s
    cash needs. Distributions, other than priority distributions
    (Note 9), are made to each of the partners in accordance
    with their respective ownership interests at the time of the
    distribution.

Rental Revenues.

The Fund, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. In addition, the Fund nets its bad debt expense
    against rental income for financial reporting purposes. During
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund
    recorded bad debt expense of ¥ 249.0 million and
    ¥ 93.5 million, respectively. The ¥
    249.0 million consists of ¥ 220.0 million for
    base rent and utilities, ¥ 18.7 million for punitive
    rent, and ¥ 10.3 million for termination compensation
    and restoration. The Fund recorded ¥ 137.9 million and
    ¥ 163.0 million of revenue related to the amortization
    of lease intangibles for the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. The lease intangibles are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Deferred tax assets and valuation
    allowance.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    reflect the effects of tax losses, credits, and the future
    income tax effects of temporary differences between the Fund
    financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
    using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the
    years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
    recovered or

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

settled. A valuation allowance is recognized, based on
    historical and projected financial information of the Fund along
    with any positive or negative evidence, when it is
    more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred
    tax asset will not be realized.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Fund in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Fund’s ability to lease space and on
    the level of rent that can be achieved. The Fund had five
    tenants that accounted for 40.5 percent of rental revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Fund’s financial instruments include mortgage loans
    payable, bonds payable and an unsecured loan payable. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Fund at December 31, 2009,
    the estimated fair value of the financial instruments was ¥
    75.0 billion.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Fund adopted policies related to
    accounting for business combinations, which changes the
    accounting for business combinations including the measurement
    of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business
    combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the
    accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
    accounting for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals,
    the treatment of acquisition-related transaction costs and the
    recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax
    valuation allowance. This adoption did not have a material
    effect on the Fund’s financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Fund adopted policies
    related to accounting for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as capital in
    the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
    adoption, the Fund has retroactively renamed the minority
    interests as noncontrolling interests and has reclassified these
    balances to the capital section of the consolidated balance
    sheets. In addition, on the consolidated statements of
    operations, the presentation of net income retroactively
    includes the portion of income attributable to noncontrolling
    interests.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Fund adopted policies
    related to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
    activities

,

which provides enhanced disclosures about
    (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments,
    (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for, and (c) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. This adoption did not have
    a material effect on the Fund’s financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance related to
    accounting for fair value measurements which define fair value
    and establish a framework for measuring fair value in order to
    meet disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Fair
    value is defined as the exchange price that would be received
    for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
    the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    on the measurement date. This guidance also establishes a fair
    value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels
    of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated
    balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the
    valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1.

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
    liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative
    contracts that are traded in an active exchange market.

Level 2.

Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
    other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities
    include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less
    frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative
    contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with
    inputs that

S-59


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are observable in the market or can be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. This category
    generally includes certain corporate debt securities and
    derivative contracts.

Level 3.

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation. This
    category generally includes long-term derivative contracts and
    real estate.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, neither

    financial assets nor impairment charges were recorded following
    the review for impairment. This adoption had no material impact
    on the Fund’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Effective June 2009, the Fund adopted a policy related to
    disclosures of subsequent events which involves accounting for
    and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
    but before financial statements are issued or are available to
    be issued. This adoption did not have any impact on the
    Fund’s financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (Codification) which identifies the sources of
    accounting principles and the framework for selecting the
    principles used in the preparation of its financial statements
    that are presented in conformity with GAAP. Effective September
    2009, the Fund has adopted the Codification, which did not have
    a material impact on the Fund’s financial statements.

Reclassifications.

Certain items in the
    consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been
    reclassified to conform to current classifications.

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Fund acquired
    an 80.81 percent equity interest in one entity that
    indirectly owned one operating property aggregating
    981,162 square feet (unaudited) from AMB Japan. AMB
    Singapore retained 19.19 percent of the equity interest in
    the same entity. The total aggregate investment cost was
    approximately ¥ 16.6 billion.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund acquired
    an 80.81 percent equity interest in two entities that
    indirectly owned two operating properties aggregating
    891,596 square feet (unaudited) from AMB Japan. AMB
    Singapore retained 19.19 percent of the equity interest in
    the same entities. The total aggregate investment cost was
    approximately ¥ 18.7 billion which includes
    approximately ¥ 23.3 million in closing costs related
    to these acquisitions. As of December 31, 2008, the Fund
    owed AMB Japan ¥ 163.0 million, which represents the
    unpaid portion of the purchase price related to the
    acquisitions, and is included in net payables to affiliates in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Fund paid this
    unpaid portion of purchase price to AMB Japan in 2009.

DEBT

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund had five and
    four mortgage loans payable totaling ¥ 24.5 billion
    and ¥ 16.7 billion, respectively. Of the ¥
    24.5 billion mortgage loans payable, ¥
    21.8 billion bears interest at a rate per annum equal to
    three-month Yen TIBOR or three-month Yen LIBOR plus a margin
    ranging from 130 to 200 basis points, ¥
    10.4 billion matures in September 2010, ¥
    3.6 billion matures in August 2011 and ¥
    7.8 billion matures in November 2011. To hedge the cash
    flows of these floating rate borrowings, the Fund purchased
    interest swaps and interest rate caps, which have fixed the
    interest rates payable on principal amounts totaling ¥
    21.8 billion as of December 31, 2009 at rates ranging
    from 1.05 percent to 1.50 percent per annum, excluding
    margins. Including the interest rate swaps and interest rate
    caps, the effective borrowings cost for the ¥
    21.8 billion mortgage loans payable as of December 31,
    2009 is 2.45 percent. Of the ¥ 21.8 billion
    mortgage loans payable, ¥ 14.0 billion is
    collateralized by a first priority security interest in, and to
    all of certain TMKs’ right, title and interest in and to
    twelve buildings, and severally but not jointly guaranteed by
    the Fund and AMB Singapore, the indirect owners of the TMKs. The
    remaining ¥ 7.8 billion is collateralized by a first
    priority security interest in certain TMK’s right, title
    and interest in one building.

Of the remainder of the ¥ 24.5 billion, ¥
    2.7 billion as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008, not
    including unamortized mortgage premiums of approximately ¥
    7.5 million and ¥ 13.5 million, respectively,
    bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures
    in 2011. The mortgage loan payable is collateralized by two
    buildings and requires interest only payments to be made
    quarterly until maturity in 2011. In addition, the mortgage loan
    payable has various covenants. Management of the Fund believes
    that the Fund was in compliance with these covenants at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund had one
    collateralized bond payable, totaling ¥ 3.2 billion
    and ¥ 3.3 billion, respectively, not including an
    unamortized bond premium of ¥ 9.4 million and ¥
    16.9 million, respectively. The bond bears interest at a
    fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures in 2011. Principal
    amortization on the bond started in June 2007.

If at any such time the principal outstanding on the ¥
    3.2 billion bond payable reaches the balance of the
    principal outstanding on the ¥ 2.7 billion mortgage
    loan payable, amortization of principal would then be applied on
    a pro rata basis of 50.0 percent to the bond payable and
    50.0 percent to the mortgage loan payable.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund had eight and
    seven collateralized specified bonds payable, respectively,
    totaling ¥ 49.7 billion and ¥ 50.3 billion,
    respectively. Of the ¥ 49.7 billion bonds payable,
    ¥ 40.6 billion bears interest at rates per annum
    equal to the rates of three-month Yen TIBOR or three-month Yen
    LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to 200 basis points and
    matures between 2011 and 2013. To hedge the cash flows of these
    floating rate borrowings, the Fund purchased interest swaps and
    interest rate caps, which have fixed the interest rates payable
    on principal amounts totaling ¥ 36.6 billion and
    ¥ 36.4 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, at rates ranging from 1.32 percent to
    1.60 percent per annum excluding the margin. Including the
    interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, the effective
    borrowing costs for the ¥ 40.6 billion and ¥
    41.0 billion bonds

payable as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 respectively, are
    2.50 percent and 2.56 percent per annum, respectively.
    Of the remainder of the ¥ 49.7 billion bonds payable,
    ¥ 6.8 billion and ¥ 2.3 billion bear
    interest at fixed rates of 2.54 percent and
    4.30 percent, respectively, and mature in 2013.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund had an unsecured
    loan payable totaling ¥ 800.0 million and a secured
    loan payable totaling ¥ 12.0 billion, respectively.
    The outstanding unsecured loan payable bears interest at a rate
    per annum equal to three-month Yen LIBOR plus a margin of
    275 basis points. The loan matures in January 2011. For the
    year ended December 31, 2009, the interest rate
    approximated 3.35 percent per annum. The secured loan
    payable of ¥ 12.0 billion as of December 31, 2008
    was collateralized by the partners’ capital commitments and
    bore interest at a rate of 1.79 percent per annum. This
    loan was repaid in January 2009.

The scheduled principal payments of the Fund’s mortgage

DERIVATIVES
    AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Risk
    Management Objective of Using Derivatives

The Fund is exposed to certain risk arising from both its
    business operations and economic conditions. The Fund
    principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business
    and operational risks through management of its core business
    activities. The Fund manages economic risks, including interest
    rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the
    amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of
    derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Fund enters
    into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that
    arise from business activities that result in the payment of
    future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are
    determined by interest rates. The Fund’s derivative
    financial instruments are used to manage differences in the
    amount, timing, and duration of the Fund’s known or
    expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments
    principally related to the Fund’s borrowings. The
    Fund’s derivative financial instruments in effect at
    December 31, 2009 were six interest rate swaps hedging cash
    flows of variable rate borrowings based on Yen TIBOR, two
    interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of variable rate
    borrowings based on Yen LIBOR and two interest rate caps hedging
    the cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on Yen LIBOR.

Cash
    Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

The Fund’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives
    are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its
    exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this
    objective, the Fund primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps
    as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest
    rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of
    variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the
    Fund making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements
    without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest
    rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of
    variable-rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise
    above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront
    premium.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of
    derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is
    recorded in other comprehensive income and is subsequently
    reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged
    forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, such derivatives were used to hedge the
    variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate
    borrowings.

Amounts reported in other comprehensive loss related to
    derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest
    payments are made on the Fund’s variable-rate borrowings.
    During the twelve month period from December 31, 2009, the
    Fund estimates that an additional ¥ 425.2 million will
    be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

Credit-risk-related
    Contingent Features

In order to limit the financial risks associated with derivative
    applications, the Fund adheres to the Fund’s Derivative
    policy to minimize counterparty risk. The derivative contracts
    are executed by the subsidiary of the Fund that is the borrower
    of the debt being hedged. With the exception of the two interest
    rate caps, the derivative counterparty is the same entity as, or
    an affiliate of, the lender of the applicable borrowings.
    Certain of the derivative contracts provide that if the
    borrower’s counterparty is downgraded below BBB- by
    S&P it can constitute an additional termination event.

Some of the Fund’s subsidiaries’ agreements with their
    derivative counterparties also include a provision that an
    occurrence of an Event of Default under the applicable borrowing
    being hedged would constitute an Event of Default under the
    applicable derivative contract. Some of the borrowing agreements
    of the Fund’s subsidiaries also contain a provision that a
    default under a derivative contract by the entity could, if it
    continues without waiver or cure, constitute an Event of Default
    under the borrowing agreements.

INCOME
    AND WITHHOLDING TAXES

The Fund is exempt from all forms of taxation in the Cayman
    Islands, including income, capital gains, and withholding tax.
    The foreign countries where the Fund has operations may impose
    income, withholding, and other direct and indirect taxes under
    their respective laws. Generally, the foreign countries impose a
    withholding tax rate on dividends or interest between countries
    based on various treaty rates. The Japanese Yugen Kaisha
    (“YK”) entities are also subject to a 40.69% statutory
    rate. Accordingly, the Fund recognizes income taxes for these
    jurisdictions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as necessary.
    As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund has accrued a
    current tax liability of ¥ 209.8 million and ¥
    264.4 million, respectively, representing future
    withholding taxes on distributions from operations and other
    local income taxes in Japan and Singapore. The Fund also accrued
    a deferred tax asset of ¥ 27.7 million and ¥
    49.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The accrued tax liability and the deferred tax
    asset are included in accounts payable and other liabilities and
    accounts receivable and other assets, respectively, in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The tax consequences for each partner of the Fund of acquiring,
    holding, or disposing of partnership interests will depend upon
    the relevant laws of any jurisdiction to which the partner is
    subject.

Effectively January 1, 2008, the Fund adopted policies
    related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which
    clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
    positions, and such adoption did not have a material impact on
    the Fund.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
    Agreement and the Co-Investment Agreement, AMB Japan receives an
    acquisition fee equal to 0.9 percent of the Fund’s
    share of the acquisition cost of properties purchased from third
    parties. This acquisition fee is reduced by a 0.4 percent
    acquisition fee AMB Singapore receives of the acquisition cost
    of properties purchased from third parties who are referred to
    the Fund by AMB Singapore. The Fund paid no acquisition fee to
    AMB Japan during the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008. Prior to January 1, 2009, acquisition fees are
    capitalized and included in investments in real estate in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Pursuant to the
    Fund’s adoption of policies related to accounting for
    business combinations, acquisition costs are now expensed and
    included in general and administrative expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund had an
    obligation of ¥ 0 and ¥ 163.0 million,
    respectively, payable to AMB Japan, related to the unpaid
    portion of the contribution value for the Singapore PTE entities
    contributed to the Fund by AMB Japan, which is included in net
    payables to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets. The obligation as of December 31, 2008 of ¥
    163.0 million has been paid to AMB Japan during 2009.

Pursuant to the Asset Management Fees Agreement, on
    January 1, 2006, AMB Property Japan began providing asset
    management services to the Properties. The asset management fee
    is payable monthly. For the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, the Fund recorded asset management fees of
    approximately ¥ 242.2 million and ¥
    187.1 million, respectively, which are included in general
    and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations.

Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, AMB Singapore
    receives management service fees, payable on a quarterly basis,
    equal to 0.25 percent of capital (equity and shareholder
    loans) contributed to each PTE by the Fund and AMB Singapore.
    For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the PTEs
    recorded management service fees of approximately ¥
    76.2 million and ¥ 61.1 million, respectively,
    which are included in general and administrative expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund owed ¥
    20.1 million and ¥ 50.1 million, respectively,
    for management service fees, which are included in net
    receivables from affiliates and net payables to affiliates,
    respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement from June 30, 2005 to
    June 30, 2006, AMB Japan, as general partner, received
    asset management priority distributions equal to
    1.5 percent per annum, payable on a quarterly basis, of
    aggregate capital commitments made to the Fund from the
    effective date of the agreement through the Supplemental Capital
    Call Date (as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement).
    Pursuant to the Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated
    Limited Partnership Agreement of the Limited Partnership, for
    the period from July 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007,
    the asset management priority distribution base changed from
    100.0 percent to 90.0 percent of the aggregate capital
    commitments to the Fund; for the period from April 1, 2007
    through March 31, 2008, the asset management priority
    distribution base changed from 90.0 percent to
    80.0 percent of the aggregate capital commitments to the
    Fund; for the period from April 1, 2008 through the
    Supplementary Capital Call Date, the asset management priority
    distribution base changed from 80.0 percent to
    65.0 percent of the aggregate capital commitments to the
    Fund until the Triggering Event Date (as defined in the Limited
    Partnership Agreement) which is the earlier of the date the
    unfunded capital commitments is less than 35.0 percent or
    the Supplemental Capital Call Date. Subsequently, AMB Japan
    receives asset management priority distribution equal to
    1.5 percent per annum, payable on a quarterly basis, of the
    unreturned capital contributions. The amounts referred to above
    are reduced by amounts paid or accrued to AMB Singapore for
    management service fees pursuant to the Management Services
    Agreement and asset management fees paid or accrued to AMB
    Property Japan, pursuant to the Agreement Regarding Asset
    Management Fees.

AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Fund reached its Triggering Event Date on January 7,
    2009. Promptly following the Triggering Event Date, an asset
    management priority distribution recalculation was performed as
    follows:

(i) For the period from July 1, 2006 through
    March 31, 2007 (the “First Calculation Period”),
    the asset management priority distribution was recalculated
    based on the greater of 90.0 percent of the aggregate
    capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent of the
    unreturned capital contributions. The recalculated asset
    management priority distribution was greater than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the First
    Calculation Period, and a priority distribution true up of
    ¥ 56.2 million is payable by the Fund to AMB Japan,
    which is included in distributions payable in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets.

(ii) For the period from April 1, 2007 through
    March 31, 2008 (the “Second Calculation Period”),
    the asset management priority distribution was recalculated
    based on the greater of 80.0 percent of the aggregate
    capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent of the
    unreturned capital contributions. The recalculated asset
    management priority distribution was greater than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Second
    Calculation Period, and a priority distribution true up of
    ¥ 149.9 million is payable by the Fund to AMB Japan,
    which is included in distributions payable in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets.

(iii) For the period from April 1, 2008 through the
    Triggering Event Date (the “Third Calculation
    Period”), the asset management priority distribution was
    recalculated based on the greater of 65.0 percent of the
    aggregate capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent
    of the unreturned capital contributions. The recalculated asset
    management priority distribution was greater than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Third
    Calculation Period, and a priority distribution true up of
    ¥ 201.8 million is payable by the Fund to AMB Japan,
    which is included in distributions payable in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets.

As a result of the asset management priority distribution
    recalculation the Fund accrued priority distributions true ups
    to AMB Japan totaling ¥ 407.9 million during the year
    ended December 31, 2009, which is included in priority
    distributions in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations.

For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund
    recorded assets management priority distributions of
    approximately ¥ 895.0 million and ¥
    314.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009
    and 2008, the Fund owed ¥ 1.6 billion and ¥
    1.1 billion, respectively, for asset management priority
    distributions, which are included in distributions payable in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, AMB Japan receives
    incentive distributions equal to 20.0 percent of the amount
    over a 10.0 percent net nominal internal rate of return
    (“IRR”) accruing to the limited partners. The
    incentive distributions increase to 25.0 percent of the
    amount over a 13.0 percent IRR accruing to the limited
    partners. As of December 31, 2009, no incentive
    distribution has been paid or accrued.

AMB, the indirect owner of AMB Japan, obtains company-wide
    insurance coverage from third parties that apply to all
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including the Properties. As
    such, the Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance
    expense incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund recorded insurance
    expense of approximately ¥ 239.0 million and ¥
    222.4 million, respectively.

At certain properties, AMB Property Japan earns a market rate
    leasing commission when it has acted as the listing broker or
    the procuring broker or both. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, AMB Property Japan earned
    leasing commissions of approximately ¥ 110.0 million
    and ¥ 35.5 million, respectively.

Pursuant to the Property Management Agreements with certain
    TMKs, AMB Property Japan earns property management fees for
    managing their properties. For the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008, AMB Property Japan earned property management
    fees of approximately ¥ 68.3 million and ¥ 0,
    respectively.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset Management Agreements
    with certain TMKs, AMB Property Japan earns an accounting fee
    for maintaining the books and records with respect to their
    properties. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    AMB Japan earned accounting fees of approximately ¥
    7.5 million and ¥ 12.4 million, respectively.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. Management of the Fund believes that the
    policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate
    and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk
    of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Fund’s properties are located in
    areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Fund has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although the Fund has
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that management of the Fund
    believes are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the
    Fund will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Fund.

11.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Fund
    evaluated subsequent events occurring through February 11,
    2010, the date these financial statements were issued, in
    accordance with the Fund’s policy related to disclosures of
    subsequent events.

ORGANIZATION

On May 19, 2005, AMB Japan Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Japan”) and AMB Property II, L.P. as limited partner,
    formed AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. (the “Fund”), a
    Cayman Islands-exempted limited partnership. On June 30,
    2005 (“Inception”), 13 institutional investors were
    admitted as limited partners to the Fund and AMB Property II,
    L.P. withdrew as a limited partner.

The limited partners have collectively committed ¥
    49.5 billion in equity to the Fund and AMB Japan, as
    general partner, has committed ¥0.5 billion in equity
    to the Fund. In addition, AMB Property Singapore Pte. Ltd.
    (“AMB Singapore”) has committed
    ¥11.9 billion in equity to co-invest with the Fund in
    properties. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had completed
    five capital calls totaling ¥26.8 billion and
    ¥0.3 billion from the limited partners and general
    partner, respectively, of which non-cash contributions from the
    general partner totaled ¥0.2 billion.

The Fund and AMB Singapore co-invest (80.81 percent and
    19.19 percent, respectively) in Singapore private limited
    companies (“PTEs”) which indirectly own industrial
    real estate in Japan. The properties are owned individually in
    Japanese Tokutei Mokuteki Kaishas (“TMKs”). TMKs are
    asset-backed entities subject to tax on income net of
    distributions. Distributions from TMKs to non-residents are
    subject to local withholding taxes.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund indirectly owned
    80.81 percent of 24 operating buildings (the
    “Properties”) aggregating approximately
    5.4 million square feet (unaudited). The Properties are
    located in the Fukuoka market and in the following submarkets of
    Tokyo: Chiba, Funabashi, Kashiwa, Kawasaki, Narita, Narashino,
    Ohta, and Saitama, and the Amagasaki submarket of Osaka.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“U.S. GAAP”) in Yen currency. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the
    Fund and the joint ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s joint
    ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements. All significant
    intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Functional and Reporting Currency.

The Yen is
    both the functional and reporting currency for the Fund’s
    operations. Functional currency is the currency of the primary
    economic environment in which the Fund operates. Monetary assets
    and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Yen are
    remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value
    of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying
    values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for
    impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economic and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of

S-74


AMB JAPAN
    FUND I, L.P.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Fund’s long-lived assets could occur in the future
    period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a
    property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the
    property over its estimated fair value is charged to income and
    is included in the consolidated statement of operations. The
    management of the Fund believes that there were no impairments
    of the carrying values of its investments in real estate as of
    December 31, 2007.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    investments in real estate. The estimated lives are as follows:

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Estimated Lives

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in the property
    including legal fees and acquisition costs.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or betterments
    that extend the economic life of assets are capitalized.

The Fund records at acquisition an intangible asset or liability
    for the value attributable to above- or below-market leases,
    in-place leases and lease origination costs. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Fund has recorded intangible assets
    and liabilities in the amounts of ¥553.4 million,
    ¥1.2 billion, and ¥137.1 million for the
    value attributable to below-market leases, in-place leases, and
    lease origination costs, respectively, which are included in
    buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    reserves required to be held pursuant to agreements with Chuo
    Mitsui Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., JP Morgan
    Trust Bank, Ltd. (“JP Morgan”), Sumitomo Mitsui
    Banking Corporation and Shinsei Bank, Limited, as well as cash
    held in escrow under the terms of the loan agreement with JP
    Morgan. Pursuant to these agreements, minimum levels of cash are
    required to be held as reserves for operating expenses, real
    estate taxes and insurance reserves, security deposits,
    consumption tax and maintenance reserves. Restricted cash also
    includes cash held directly by the Fund as collateral for a
    ¥2.2 billion of secured loan payable in connection
    with the Fund’s acquisition of AMB Funabashi Distribution
    Center 6. Upon repayment of the secured loan payable, the cash
    will be released. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
    ¥2.6 billion of restricted cash, which was held
    directly by the Fund as collateral, was released upon full
    repayment of the ¥2.6 billion secured loan payable in
    connection with the Fund’s acquisition of Higashi-Ogijima
    Distribution Center in 2005.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    terms of the related debt. As of December 31, 2007,
    deferred financing costs were ¥458.8 million, net of
    accumulated amortization.

Financial Instruments.

Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging Activities, provides
    comprehensive guidelines for the recognition and measurement of
    derivatives and hedging activities and, specifically, requires
    all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
    value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated
    other comprehensive income or loss. The Fund’s derivative
    financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2007 were
    five interest rate swaps, hedging cash flows of the Fund’s
    variable rate bonds based on Tokyo Inter-bank Offered Rate
    (“TIBOR”) and London Inter-

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin. Adjustments
    to the fair value of these instruments for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 resulted in a loss of
    ¥406.1 million, net of noncontrolling interests. There
    were no other derivative financial instruments included in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. This loss is included in accounts
    payable and other liabilities and other comprehensive loss in
    the accompanying consolidated statement of partners’
    capital and noncontrolling interests.

Mortgage and Bond Premiums.

Mortgage and bond
    premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt over the
    principal value of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions.
    The mortgage and bond premiums are being amortized into interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    effective-interest method. As of December 31, 2007, the
    unamortized mortgage and bond premiums were approximately
    ¥43.9 million.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent a 19.19 percent indirect equity
    interest in the Properties held by AMB Singapore. Such
    investments are consolidated because the Fund owns a majority
    interest and exercises significant control through the ability
    to control major operating decisions.

Partners’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Fund are allocated to each of the partners in accordance
    with the Fund’s partnership agreement. Partner
    distributions are expected to be made on a semi-annual basis
    when distributable proceeds are available. Distributions, other
    than priority distributions (Note 8), are made to each of
    the partners in accordance with their respective ownership
    interests at the time of the distribution.

Rental Revenues.

The Fund, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses
    are incurred. The Fund recorded ¥95.7 million of
    revenue related to the amortization of lease intangibles for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. The lease intangibles are
    being amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Fund in its
    trade areas. This results in competition for tenants to occupy
    space. The existence of competing properties could have a
    material impact on the Fund’s ability to lease space and on
    the level of rent that can be achieved. The Fund had five
    tenants that accounted for 47.7 percent of rental revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Fund’s financial instruments include a mortgage loan
    payable, bonds payable and secured loans payable. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Fund at December 31, 2007,
    the estimated fair market value of the financial instruments was
    ¥74.4 billion.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In July 2006,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), which
    clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
    positions, as defined. FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity
    in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition
    and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. Adoption
    of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not have a material
    effect on the Fund.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The Fund does not believe that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact
    on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

, which permits entities to choose to measure
    many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
    that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between entities

that choose different measurement attributes for similar types
    of assets and liabilities. This Statement is effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal year beginning after
    November 15, 2007. The Fund does not believe that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact
    on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

REAL
    ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund acquired
    11 buildings totaling 1,105,800 square feet (unaudited).
    The total aggregate investment was approximately
    ¥22.0 billion, which includes approximately
    ¥660.9 million in closing costs and acquisition fees
    related to these acquisitions.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund acquired
    an 80.81 percent equity interest in an entity that
    indirectly owned an operating property aggregating
    469,627 square feet (unaudited) from AMB Japan. AMB
    Singapore retained 19.19 percent of the equity interest in
    the same entity. The total aggregate investment cost was
    approximately ¥9.7 billion which includes
    ¥19.5 million in closing costs. As of
    December 31, 2007, AMB Japan owed the Fund
    ¥29.7 million, which represents the overpaid portion
    of the purchase price, and is included in net payables to
    affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The total purchase price, excluding closing costs and
    acquisition fees has been allocated as follows:

DEBT

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had one mortgage loan
    payable totaling ¥2.7 billion, not including an
    unamortized mortgage premium of approximately
    ¥19.5 million. The mortgage loan payable bears
    interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures in
    2011.

The mortgage loan payable is collateralized by certain of the
    Properties and requires interest only payments to be made
    quarterly until maturity in 2011. In addition, the mortgage loan
    payable has various covenants. Management of the Fund believes
    that the Fund was in compliance with these covenants as of
    December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had one collateralized
    bond payable totaling ¥3.3 billion, not including an
    unamortized bond premium of ¥24.4 million. The bond
    bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.83 percent and matures
    in 2011. Principal amortization on this bond started in June
    2007.

If at any such time the principal outstanding on the
    ¥3.3 billion bond payable reaches the balance of the
    principal outstanding on the ¥2.7 billion mortgage
    loan payable, amortization of principal would then be applied on
    a pro rata basis of 50.0 percent to the bond payable and
    50.0 percent to the mortgage loan payable.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had five collateralized
    specified bonds payable totaling ¥41.2 billion. The
    bonds bear interest at rates per annum equal to the rates of the
    TIBOR and Yen LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to
    155 basis points and mature between 2012 and 2013. To hedge
    the cash flows of these floating rate borrowings, the Fund
    purchased interest swaps, which have fixed the interest rates
    payable on principal amounts totaling ¥36.6 billion as
    of December 31, 2007, at rates ranging from
    1.32 percent to 1.60 percent per annum excluding the

margin. Including the interest rate swaps, the effective
    borrowing costs for the ¥41.2 billion bonds as of
    December 31, 2007 is 2.54 percent per annum.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had secured loans payable
    totaling ¥27.3 billion:

(i) Of the ¥27.3 billion secured loans payable,
    ¥15.5 billion bears interest at a rate per annum equal
    to TIBOR plus a margin ranging from 20 to 95 basis points.
    ¥13.3 billion matures in June 2008 and
    ¥2.2 billion matures in February 2008. For the year
    ended December 31, 2007, the interest rate approximated
    0.74 percent per annum. ¥2.2 billion of the loans
    payable is secured by the restricted cash balances held directly
    by the Fund in a cash collateral account.
    ¥13.3 billion of the loans payable is secured by a
    first priority security interest in, and to all of certain
    TMKs’ right, title and interest in and to nine buildings,
    and severally but not jointly guaranteed by the Fund and AMB
    Singapore, the indirect owners of the TMKs.

(ii) Of the ¥27.3 billion secured loans payable,
    ¥11.8 billion bears interest at a rate per annum equal
    to LIBOR plus a margin of 75 basis points and matures in
    April 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the
    interest rate approximated 1.31 percent per annum. The loan
    payable is secured by the partners’ capital commitments.

The scheduled principal payments of the Fund’s mortgage
    payable, bonds payable and secured loans payable as of
    December 31, 2007 are as follows (Yen in thousands):

    properties, mortgage loan payable, bonds payable, and secured
    loans payable are all held in Japanese TMKs, which are special
    purpose companies (“SPCs”). TMKs are SPCs established
    under Japanese Asset Liquidation law. As of December 31,
    2007, the nine TMKs included in the Fund’s consolidated
    financial statements are AMB Funabashi Tokorozawa TMK, AMB
    Higashi-Ogijima TMK, AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Narita 1-1 TMK, AMB
    Amagasaki TMK, AMB Kashiwa TMK, AMB Funabashi 6 TMK, AMB Minami
    Kanto TMK and AMB Funabashi 5 TMK. The Properties owned by AMB
    Funabashi Tokorozawa TMK collateralize one mortgage loan payable
    and one bond payable. One of the secured loans payable held by
    AMB Funabashi 6 TMK is collateralized by cash directly held by
    the Fund in a cash collateral account. The properties owned by
    AMB Tokai TMK, AMB Narita 1-1 TMK, AMB Amagasaki TMK, AMB
    Kashiwa TMK and AMB Funabashi 5 TMK collateralize bonds payable
    by the respective entities. Four out of the five properties
    owned by AMB Funabashi 6 TMK and five properties owned by AMB
    Minami Kanto TMK collateralize secured loans payable. The
    creditors of the TMKs do not have recourse to any other assets
    or revenues of AMB Japan or its affiliated entities. Conversely,
    the creditors of AMB Japan and its affiliated entities do not
    have recourse to any of the assets or revenues of the TMKs.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

During the year ended December 31, 2007, AMB Japan
    contributed its equity interest in one Singapore PTE entity,
    which owned a 80.81 percent indirect interest in one
    operating property, aggregating 0.5 million square feet
    (unaudited), to the Fund. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund
    had an obligation of ¥86.0 million, payable to AMB
    Japan, related to the unpaid portion of the contribution value
    for the Singapore PTE entities, which is included in net
    payables to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheet.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
    Agreement and the Co-Investment Agreement, AMB Japan receives an
    acquisition fee equal to 0.9 percent of the Fund’s
    share of the acquisition cost of properties purchased from third
    parties. This acquisition fee is reduced by a 0.4 percent
    acquisition fee AMB Singapore receives of the acquisition cost
    of properties purchased from third parties who are referred to
    the Fund by AMB Singapore. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, the Fund incurred acquisition fees of approximately
    ¥157.0 million, of which ¥87.2 million was
    paid to AMB Japan and ¥69.8 million was paid to AMB
    Singapore related to the Fund’s acquisition of AMB
    Funabashi Distribution Center 6-9, AMB Fukuoka Distribution
    Center 1, AMB Chiba Distribution Center 1, AMB Higashi-Ogijima
    Distribution Center 2, AMB Narashino Distribution Center 1 and
    AMB Saitama Distribution Center 4 and 5. As of December 31,
    2007, ¥2.3 million was payable to AMB Japan and
    ¥1.9 million was payable to AMB Singapore related to
    the Fund’s acquisition of AMB Saitama Distribution Center
    4, which are included in net payables to affiliates in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The acquisition fee paid to AMB Blackpine Ltd (a former joint
    venture company which was subsequently fully acquired by
    AMB’s wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary during the year
    ended December 31, 2006) in relation to the
    acquisition of Higashi-Ogijima Distribution Center in 2005 was
    capitalized and included in investments in real estate in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31,
    2007, the unamortized acquisition fee was approximately
    ¥59.7 million.

Pursuant to an asset management fees agreement, on
    January 1, 2006, AMB Property Japan began providing asset
    management services to the Properties. The asset management fee
    is payable monthly. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    the Fund recorded asset management fees of approximately
    ¥146.1 million.

Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, AMB Singapore
    receives management service fees, payable on a quarterly basis,
    equal to 0.25 percent of capital (equity and shareholder
    loans) contributed to each PTE by the Fund and AMB Singapore.
    For the year ended December 31, 2007, the PTEs recorded
    management service fees of

approximately ¥49.3 million. As of December 31,
    2007, the Fund owed ¥44.5 million, for management
    service fees, which are included in net payables to affiliates
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated
    Limited Partnership Agreement of Limited Partnership, for the
    period from July 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007, the
    asset management priority distribution base changed from
    100.0 percent to 90.0 percent of the aggregate capital
    commitments to the Fund; and for the period from April 1,
    2007 through the Supplemental Capital Call Date, the asset
    management priority distribution base changed from
    90.0 percent to 80.0 percent of the aggregate capital
    commitments to the Fund until the earlier of 80.0 percent
    of capital commitments being called or the Supplemental Capital
    Call Date. Subsequently, AMB Japan receives asset management
    priority distributions equal to 1.5 percent per annum,
    payable on a quarterly basis, of the unreturned capital
    contributions. The amounts referred to above are reduced by
    amounts paid or accrued to AMB Singapore for management service
    fees pursuant to the Management Services Agreement and asset
    management fees paid or accrued to AMB Property Japan, pursuant
    to the Agreement Regarding Asset Management Fees.

Promptly following the Supplemental Capital Call Date, an asset
    management priority distribution recalculation will be performed
    as follows:

(i) For the period from July 1, 2006 through
    March 31, 2007 (the “First Calculation Period”),
    the asset management priority distribution will be recalculated
    based on the greater of 90.0 percent of the aggregate
    capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent of the
    unreturned capital contributions. If the recalculated asset
    management priority distribution is greater than the amount
    previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the First
    Calculation Period, a special payment equal to the difference
    shall be paid by the Fund to AMB Japan at the time of such
    recalculation. If the recalculated asset management priority
    distribution is equal to or less than the amount previously
    earned by AMB Japan with respect to the First Calculation
    Period, no additional amount shall be paid by the Fund to AMB
    Japan and no refund of such difference shall be paid by AMB
    Japan to the Fund.

(ii) For the period from April 1, 2007 through the
    Supplemental Capital Call Date (the “Second Calculation
    Period”), the asset management priority distribution will
    be recalculated based on the greater of 80.0 percent of the
    aggregate capital commitments to the Fund and 100.0 percent
    of the unreturned capital contributions. If the recalculated
    asset management priority distribution is greater than the
    amount previously earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Second
    Calculation Period, a special payment equal to the difference
    shall be paid by the Fund to AMB Japan at the time of such
    recalculation. If the recalculated asset management priority
    distribution is equal to or less than the amount previously
    earned by AMB Japan with respect to the Second Calculation
    Period, no additional amount shall be paid by the Fund to AMB
    Japan and no refund of such difference shall be paid by AMB
    Japan to the Fund.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund recorded
    asset management priority distributions of approximately
    ¥460.2 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund
    owed ¥1.2 billion, for asset management priority
    distributions, which are included in distributions payable in
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement, AMB Japan
    receives incentive distributions equal to 20.0 percent of
    the amount over a 10.0 percent net nominal internal rate of
    return (“IRR”) accruing to the limited partners. The
    incentive distributions increase to 25.0 percent of the
    amount over a 13.0 percent IRR accruing to the limited
    partners. As of December 31, 2007, no incentive
    distributions have been paid or accrued.

AMB, the indirect owner of AMB Japan, obtains company-wide
    insurance coverage from third parties that apply to all
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including the Properties. As
    such, the Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance
    expense incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the Fund recorded insurance expense of
    approximately ¥161.9 million.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. Management of the Fund believes that the
    policy terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate
    and appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk
    of loss, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Fund’s properties are located in
    areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Fund has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although the Fund has
    obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits that management of the Fund
    believes are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the
    Fund will be able to collect under such policies. Should an
    uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Fund.

10.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Effective January 1, 2009, the Fund adopted policies
    related to accounting for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as capital in
    the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
    adoption, the Fund has renamed minority interests as
    noncontrolling interests and has reclassified these balances
    within the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, on the
    consolidated statement of operations, the presentation of net
    income includes the portion of income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests.

AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2009 and 2008

(Report not required)

1.

ORGANISATION

AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS (the “Fund”) was
    formed on May 31, 2007 (“Incorporation”) as a

fonds commun de placement

organised under the form of a

fonds d’ investissement specialisé

subject to
    the law of February 13, 2007 of the Grand Duchy of
    Luxembourg concerning specialised investment funds. The Fund is
    an unincorporated co-ownership of securities and other assets,
    managed in the interest of its co-owners (the
    “Unitholders”) by AMB Fund Management, S.à
    r.l. a Luxembourg private limited company (the “Management
    Company”), pursuant to the Management Regulations of the
    Fund, as the same may be modified or supplemented (“the
    Management Regulations”).

On June 12, 2007 (“Inception”), the Fund
    completed its first closing and accepted capital contributions
    from 20 Unitholders to acquire indirect real property interests.
    Also at Inception, AMB European Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Europe”) was admitted to the Fund as a Unitholder in
    exchange for the indirect contribution of 38 industrial
    buildings.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, no new Unitholders
    were admitted to the Fund. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Fund has 24 Unitholders and had received capital contributions
    of approximately €395.2 million in exchange for
    390,535 Units in the Fund. Profits and distributions of the Fund
    are allocated to Unitholders as provided in the Management
    Regulations. AMB Europe owned an approximate 20.6 percent
    interest in the Fund as of December 31, 2009.

2.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    Luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements for investment
    funds (“Lux GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position and results
    of operations of the Fund and the joint ventures in which the
    Fund has a controlling interest. Third party equity interests in
    the Fund’s joint ventures are reflected as minority
    interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
    All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated. All
    monetary figures are expressed in Euro.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with Lux GAAP requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Valuation of Real Estate Investments.

Real
    estate investments not publicly traded are carried at their
    estimated fair value in accordance with Lux GAAP.

The fair value of real estate investments held by the Fund are
    determined in accordance with the Fund’s appraisal policy
    (the “Appraisal Policy”) as approved by the Management
    Company and the three member independent council (the
    “Independent Council”) for the Fund. Under the
    Appraisal Policy, approximately one fourth of the Fund’s
    properties are valued by the Fund’s independent appraiser
    (the “Independent Appraiser”) each quarter, such that
    all properties are valued at least annually. With respect to all
    properties acquired by the Fund, the Management Company will
    determine the quarter during which each such property will first
    be appraised, provided that it is appraised within the first
    five calendar quarters beginning after the acquisition of such
    property by the Fund.

Appraisals are conducted by the Independent Appraiser in
    accordance with valuation principles set forth in the Appraisal
    and Valuation Manual as published by the Royal Institute of
    Chartered Surveyors or such other standards as may be proposed
    by the Management Company and approved by the Independent
    Council.

S-88


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Recently acquired investments are accounted for and carried at
    cost, including costs of acquisition plus capital expenditures
    subsequent to acquisition, as this is the best estimate of fair
    value.

Once a property has been appraised, the value of the property is
    the net value of the property shown in the appraisal, adjusted
    (if appropriate) to take into account unamortized closing costs
    and transfer tax savings, if any, resulting from the structure
    of the acquisition of the property, plus capital expenditures
    subsequent to the appraisal not otherwise taken into account in
    the appraisal. Closing costs are costs incurred in connection
    with the acquisition of a property indirectly through a share
    transaction or directly through an asset deal. Transfer tax
    savings result in certain cases depending on the structure of
    the acquisition transaction, and are assumed to generally be
    split between a buyer and a seller of real estate on a
    fifty-fifty basis, based on the estimated transfer taxes. The
    property values are reviewed and approved by the Management
    Company and the Independent Council.

Ultimate realisation of the fair values is dependent to a great
    extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond
    management’s control (such as general economic conditions,
    conditions affecting tenants and other events occurring in the
    markets in which individual properties are located). Further,
    values may or may not represent the prices at which the real
    estate investments would be sold since market prices of real
    estate investments can only be determined by negotiation between
    a willing buyer and seller.

Unrealised gains and losses are determined by comparing the fair
    value of the real estate investments to the total acquisition
    cost plus capital expenditures of such assets, and are
    calculated excluding the impact, if any, of movements in
    exchange rates, that occurred. Unrealised gains and losses
    relating to changes in fair value of the Fund’s real estate
    investments are reflected in the consolidated statements of
    operations as a component of unrealised gains and losses on
    investments in real estate.

Real Estate Transactions.

Purchases of real
    estate investments are recorded at the purchase price when
    beneficial ownership of the real estate has been transferred to
    the Fund. Deal costs in relation to pre-acquisition such as
    legal and other professional fees, appraisals and other direct
    expenses incurred for prospective acquisitions of properties are
    capitalised and included within the cost of the corresponding
    investment upon acquisition. In the event that the deal is
    abandoned, the costs are then charged to the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Capital Expenditures.

Expenditures which
    extend the economic life of the asset, or which represent
    additional capital improvements providing benefit in future
    periods (including tenant improvements) are capitalised together
    with the cost of investments purchased.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

All cash on hand,
    demand deposits with financial institutions and short term,
    highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow by notaries or in connection with reserves from
    loan proceeds for certain capital improvements and real estate
    tax payments.

Fund Formation Costs.

The formation costs
    of the Fund are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
    basis over a five-year period starting at Inception.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs resulting from
    debt issues are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
    basis over the period of the corresponding debt. Amortisation of
    deferred financing costs is included in interest, including
    amortisation, in the consolidated statements of operations.

Deferred Tax Asset.

Deferred tax assets are
    included in the consolidated statements of net assets when it is
    highly probable that future taxable income will be recognised in
    the foreseeable future.

Taxation in Luxembourg.

The Fund is liable for
    a subscription tax of 0.01 percent per annum computed, and
    proportionately paid on its net asset value at the end of each
    quarter.

S-89


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Luxembourg subsidiaries of the Fund are fully subject to
    Luxembourg taxes on income and net worth, however exemptions are
    available. Dividend payments to the Fund from the Luxembourg
    subsidiaries, if any, are subject to a withholding tax of
    15.0 percent. The tax implications have been discussed and
    agreed upon with the Luxembourg Tax Authorities and confirmed in
    an Advance Tax Agreement.

Taxation abroad.

Provisions for taxation are
    made for income earned by the Fund’s subsidiaries abroad on
    the basis of laws and regulations relating to taxation in the
    countries where the relevant net income is earned.

Deferred Tax Liability.

The deferred tax
    liability as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 is related to
    built-in unrealised gains on the properties. The unrealised
    taxable gains are valued at the statutory tax rate for capital
    gains in the jurisdiction in which the property is located and
    reduced by 50.0 percent to represent a customary buyer and
    seller split of proceeds on potential future dispositions.

Debt.

Debt consists of secured and unsecured
    external debt, if any, stated at face value, adjusted for
    unrealised gains or losses reflecting the change in the fair
    value of the debt.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent interests held by affiliates of AMB and third-party
    investors in various entities of the Fund. The Fund consolidates
    these investments because the Fund owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Unitholders’ Capital.

Profits and losses
    of the Fund are allocated to each of the Unitholders in
    accordance with the Management Regulations. Distributions to
    Unitholders are typically made quarterly. Distributions, other
    than incentive distributions (Note 14), are paid or accrued
    to each of the Unitholders in accordance with their respective
    Units owned at the time distributions are declared.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

The Fund may
    acquire derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to
    interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate loans. These
    financial instruments are recorded at fair value with any
    unrealised and realised gains or losses included in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Rental Revenue and Income Recognition.

The
    Fund, as a lessor, retains substantially all of the benefits and
    risks of ownership of the Properties and accounts for its leases
    as operating leases. Rental income as well as rent incentives
    are recognised on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
    leases until the first break right, if any, in the lease.
    Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other
    recoverable operating expenses are recognised as revenue in the
    period that the applicable expenses are incurred. Interest
    income is recorded on an accrual basis. Interest received is
    stated net of withholding taxes. In addition, the Fund includes
    bad debt expense in property operating costs.

Foreign Currency.

Transactions in foreign
    currencies have been translated into Euros at the rates of
    exchange prevailing at the dates of those transactions.
    Settlement of transactions in foreign currencies, as well as
    translation of monetary assets or liabilities in foreign
    currency, may cause realised or unrealised exchange rate gains
    or losses, which are included in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

Foreign currency differences relating to the translation of net
    investments in foreign entities are treated as part of
    Unitholders’ capital. Balance sheets of foreign entities
    are translated at the rate as of the balance sheet date, whereas
    the statements of operations are translated at the average rate
    of the period under review.

Receivables from Affiliates and Payables to
    Affiliates.

Receivables from and payables to
    affiliates are shown on a gross basis on the consolidated
    statements of net assets.

AMB Property, L.P. (“AMB L.P.”) obtains various types
    of liability and property insurance for the benefit of the Fund.
    The insurance coverage includes Commercial General Liability
    Insurance, Umbrella Liability and Excess Liability Insurance,
    and Broad Form All Risk Property Damage and Business
    Interruption Insurance, which include earthquake, flood,
    terrorism, and boiler and machinery. The Property Damage and
    Business Interruption Insurance provides for a $150 million
    each occurrence limit of liability subject to industry standard
    per occurrence and aggregate policy

sub-limits,

deductibles, definitions, exclusions and limitations. Property
    damage is valued on a replacement cost basis. Using this method
    for valuing loss, damages for a claim equal amount needed to
    replace the property using new materials without a reduction for
    depreciation.

AMB L.P. regularly evaluates the types and amounts of coverage
    that it carries, and to assess whether in AMB L.P.’s good
    faith discretion, the coverage and limits carried are
    appropriate for the Fund.

DEBT

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had a
    €428.0 million credit facility (“Facility
    1”) with ING Real Estate Finance Bank N.V.
    (“ING”), which provides that certain of the
    Fund’s affiliates may borrow either acquisition loans, up
    to a €100.0 million

sub-limit

(the “Acquisition Facility”), or secured term loans,
    in connection with properties located in Belgium, France,
    Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain or the United Kingdom. On
    December 22, 2009, the Fund amended and restated Facility
    1, to, among other things, extend the Acquisition Facility
    through December 31, 2010, to reduce the total commitments
    under Facility 1 to €378.0 million, with an
    Acquisition Facility

sub-limit

of
    €65.0 million, and to reduce the interest rate for
    drawings under the Acquisition Facility to 160 basis points
    over ING’s cost of funds, subject to further adjustments.
    Acquisition Facility drawings are repayable within six months of
    the date of advance, unless extended. Loan draws under Facility
    1 bear interest at a rate of 65 basis points over the Euro
    Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) if advanced before
    December 12, 2007, 90 basis points over EURIBOR if
    advanced on or after December 12, 2007 but before
    December 23, 2008 and 150 basis points over ING’s
    cost of funds if drawn on or after December 23, 2008,
    subject to further adjustments,

and may occur until its maturity on April 30, 2014. The
    Fund guarantees the Acquisition Facility and is a carve-out
    indemnitor with respect to the secured term loans.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund had
    €312.4 million and €316.9 million,
    respectively, in outstanding term loans under Facility 1. No
    amounts were outstanding under the Acquisition Facility, as of
    both respective dates. Facility 1 contains customary and other
    affirmative and negative covenants, including financial
    reporting requirements and maintenance of specific ratios. The
    Management Company of the Fund believes that the Fund was in
    compliance with these financial covenants as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

On August 9, 2007, the Fund executed with Aareal Bank A.G.
    a €275.0 million facility (“Facility 2”),
    which provides that certain of the Fund’s affiliates may
    borrow secured term loans in connection with properties located
    in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain or
    the United Kingdom. Drawings under Facility 2 may occur
    until its maturity on November 28, 2014, and those made in
    the first year bore interest at rates ranging from 75 basis
    points to 130 basis points over EURIBOR. The Fund is a
    carve-out indemnitor with respect to the secured term loans. As
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Fund had
    €165.1 million and €164.7 million,
    respectively, in outstanding term loans under Facility 2.
    Facility 2 contains customary and other affirmative covenants
    and negative covenants, including financial reporting
    requirements and maintenance of specific ratios. The Management
    Company of the Fund believes that the Fund was in compliance
    with these financial covenants as of December 31, 2009 and
    2008.

In addition to both facilities, the Fund had two mortgage loans
    outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 totaling
    €24.7 million and €26.4 million,
    respectively, which mature between 2012 and 2017. As of
    December 31, 2009, these loans, which are held with IKB
    Bank A.G. and Credit Fonciere de France, had outstanding
    balances of €12.5 million and €12.2 million,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2008, these loans had
    outstanding balances of €13.1 million and
    €13.3 million, respectively. The mortgage loans with
    IKB Bank A.G. are also secured in part with bank guarantees in
    the amount of €3.3 million, which have been issued off
    of a line of credit guaranteed by AMB L.P. These mortgage loans,
    together with the loans outstanding under the facilities, bear
    interest at a weighted average rate of 4.40 percent and
    4.96 percent as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, the Fund’s total outstanding
    debt was approximately €502.2 million, which includes
    €371.4 million and €130.8 million fixed and
    floating interest rate debt, respectively, and excludes
    €3.1 million of unfavourable fair value adjustments.
    The fixed interest rate debt includes €354.8 million
    of debt for which the variable interest rate was swapped to a
    fixed rate (Note 5).

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund’s total outstanding
    debt was approximately €508.0 million, which includes
    €375.9 million and €132.1 million fixed and
    floating interest rate debt, respectively, and excludes
    €7.7 million of favourable fair value adjustments. The
    fixed interest rate debt includes €357.9 million of
    debt for which the variable interest rate was swapped to a fixed
    rate (Note 5).

Adjustments to the fair value of the outstanding debt and
    related derivative financial instruments (Note 5) for
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 resulted in a
    net unrealised loss of approximately €10.8 million and
    a net unrealised gain of approximately €4.7 million,
    respectively .

FUND NET
    ASSET VALUE

The net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund is determined
    based on the values of the Properties (determined in accordance
    with the Appraisal Policy), and takes into account, among other
    things, the value of the Fund’s cash and short-term
    investments, an intangible asset valued based on the formation
    costs of the Fund, the carrying value of all other assets of the
    Fund, and the liabilities of the Fund, including an adjustment
    to reflect the cost or value on any above- or below- market
    indebtedness of the Fund, a ratable portion of the present value
    of the projected incentive distribution, and a provision for
    deferred tax liabilities relating to the acquisition of
    properties as determined in accordance with the Appraisal Policy.

The Fund’s NAV is determined by the Investment Advisor (as
    defined in Note 14) and is reviewed and approved by
    the Management Company and the Independent Council.

the end of each calendar quarter. The Fund incurred Management
    Fees of approximately €6.1 million and
    €7.2 million for the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Also under the Management Regulations, the Management Company is
    entitled to receive an acquisition fee (the “Acquisition
    Fee”) in an amount equal to 0.9 percent of the
    acquisition cost of properties acquired by the Fund for
    identifying, analysing, recommending and closing the purchase of
    properties acquired directly or indirectly by the Fund from a
    third party. Acquisition Fees are capitalised and included in
    investments in real estate in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of net assets. The Fund capitalised Acquisition Fees
    of €0 and approximately €0.9 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement (the
    “Advisory Agreement”), the Management Company has
    retained AMB Property Europe B.V. (the “Investment
    Advisor”) to provide operations and asset management
    services and acquisition advisory services to the Fund and its
    subsidiaries and fund advisory services to the Management
    Company. To the extent services are provided directly to the
    subsidiaries of the Fund, the Investment Advisor or its
    affiliated delegates providing such services may charge fees,
    without duplication, directly to the subsidiaries to which the
    services are provided.

At certain properties, affiliates of AMB L.P. are responsible
    for the property management or the accounting or both. For some
    properties, property management services are provided by a third
    party. On a quarterly basis, affiliates of AMB L.P. earn
    property management fees between 0.8 percent and
    2.0 percent of the respective property’s base rent.
    For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, affiliates
    of AMB L.P. earned property management fees of approximately
    €1.1 million and €1.0 million, respectively.

At certain properties, affiliates of AMB L.P. earn construction
    management fees when they have acted as the project manager.
    During both years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    affiliates of AMB L.P. earned construction management fees of
    approximately 0.1 million.

At certain properties, affiliates of AMB L.P. earn a leasing
    commission when they have acted as the listing broker or the
    procuring broker or both. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, affiliates of AMB L.P. earned
    no leasing commissions.

Commencing June 30, 2010 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB Europe is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    20.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 25.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2009, no incentive distribution has been paid to AMB Europe. The
    Fund accrued no incentive distributions to AMB Europe for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. The Fund reduced the accrual
    for the hypothetical incentive distributions to AMB Europe
    during the year ended December 31, 2008 by approximately
    €0.9 million.

AMB L.P. has a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. (“Arcata”), which provides
    insurance coverage for a portion of losses under our third-party
    policies. AMB L.P. capitalised Arcata in accordance with the
    applicable regulatory requirements. Annually, AMB L.P. engages
    an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of
    future projected claims, related deductibles and projected
    expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB L.P. based on AMB L.P.’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated
    to the Properties was approximately €1.0 million and
    €0.7 million for the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

On November 25, 2008, a tenant (the “Tenant”) at
    the AMB BRU Air Cargo Center filed a lawsuit against AMB BRU Air
    Cargo Center BVBA (“BRU Cargo”), the owner of the
    facility, alleging various claims for damages in the amount of
    approximately €0.6 million arising from the
    construction of the expansion works at the facility. BRU Cargo
    has required N.V. Cosimco (“Cosimco”), the general
    contractor for the expansion works, Guido Peters (the
    “Construction Manager”), the construction manager for
    the expansion works, and Styfhals and Partners (the
    “Architect”), the architect, to intervene in the
    proceedings on behalf of BRU Cargo, and BRU Cargo has filed
    indemnification claims against Cosimco, the Construction Manager
    and the Architect with respect to the lawsuit.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Neither BRU Cargo nor the Fund has accrued any amounts related
    to the litigation with the Tenant. BRU Cargo for itself and on
    behalf of the Fund intends to vigorously defend itself against
    the claims.

Forward Commitments.

On September 27,
    2008, the Fund entered into a forward commitment agreement to
    purchase the shares of Cargoport Grundstücks GmbH
    (“Cargoport”) upon the completion and stabilisation of
    a two-story warehouse facility by the seller on land ground
    leased by Cargoport and located in the Frankfurt market. Due to
    non-performance under the agreement, the Fund has rescinded the
    agreement and demanded payment from seller of
    €0.5 million in contractual damages. The seller has
    disputed the rescission of the agreement by the fund, however,
    no formal claim for damages has been made by the seller.

Other Commitments.

One of the Fund’s
    subsidiaries has granted a lease incentive to its lessee for an
    amount of €0.6 million as a contribution towards
    improvements to be made by the lessee to the premises. This
    amount will be paid upon receipt of a specified invoice from
    lessee in cash.

On March 9, 2009, the Fund entered into a lease agreement
    with JLM IMMO for AMB Orléans Distribution Center 1, France
    (“Orléans DC 1”). Pursuant to the terms and
    conditions in the lease agreement the tenant held an option to
    purchase Orléans DC 1 before December 31, 2009. This
    option, which was not excercised, expired on December 31,
    2009. The property was appraised during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, and the expiration of the purchase
    option was considered in the appraisal. The fair value of
    Orléans DC 1 as of December 31, 2009 was determined in
    accordance with the Fund’s Appraisal Policy (Note 2).

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows AMB
    L.P.’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on The Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can be
    no assurance that such a material environmental liability does
    not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. The Fund believes that the policy terms and
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and industry practice. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts
    of war that may be either uninsurable or not economically
    insurable. Although the Fund has obtained coverage for certain
    acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits
    that the Fund believes are commercially reasonable, it is not
    certain that the Fund will be able to collect under such
    policies. Should an uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose
    its investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from,
    a property. AMB Europe has adopted certain policies with respect
    to insurance coverage and proceeds as part of its operating
    policies, which apply to properties owned or managed by AMB
    Europe, including properties owned by the Fund.

17.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

On January 15, 2010, the Fund completed an equity closing
    totaling €34.9 million from AMB Europe, which resulted
    in third party Unitholders and AMB Europe ownership interests of
    69.6% and 30.4%, respectively.

18.

DIFFERENCES
    FROM UNITED STATES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

Luxembourg GAAP varies in certain significant respects from the
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“US GAAP”). The approximate effect of these principal
    differences on the Fund’s Audited Consolidated Statement of
    Net Assets and Audited Consolidated Statement of Operations are
    quantified below and described in the accompanying notes.

The
    differences between US GAAP and Luxembourg GAAP are summarised
    as follows:

Under US GAAP:

•

Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at
    cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be
    recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is
    reduced to estimated fair value. At

S-98


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value
    attributable to above or below-market leases, in-place leases
    and lease origination costs for all acquisitions is recorded.
    Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed
    for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period
    in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property
    is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property
    over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings.

•

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are owned by federal, state
    or local port authorities, and subject to ground leases are
    depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual
    term of the underlying ground lease. Depreciation of tenant
    improvements is recorded of the remaining lease term.
    Amortisation of above and below-market leases is recorded in
    rental revenues over the average remaining lease term. In-place
    leases are amortised over the average remaining lease term.

•

Debt premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt
    over the principal value of debt assumed in connection with the
    Fund’s formation and subsequent property acquisitions. The
    debt premiums are being amortised as an offset to interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest
    method. Costs incurred related to

start-up

activities, including organizational costs, are expensed as
    incurred. Costs incurred relating to raising capital are
    recorded as an offset to Unitholderss Capital. Financial
    instruments are recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and for Hedging Activities. This standard provides comprehensive
    guidelines for the recognition and measurement of derivatives
    and hedging activities and, specifically, requires all
    derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as
    an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss.

•

Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets can be recorded as
    an offset to deferred tax assets. The Fund is not subject to tax
    and therefore does not record deferred tax liability related to
    the ultimate sale of assets.

•

Minority interest is renamed noncontrolling interests and
    reclassified in the statements of net assets to be part of net
    assets. Additionally, the presentation of net investment income
    would include the portion of income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests.

Under Luxembourg GAAP:

•

All real estate investments, including debt investments and
    derivatives, are revalued to fair market value and the premium
    generated from the acquisition of entities at a price below fair
    market value of acquired assets and liabilities is recognised as
    an unrealised gain.

•

Organizational costs and other fund formation costs are
    capitalized and amortised on a straight-line basis over a
    5 year period.

•

Deferred tax liabilities are recorded on unrealized taxable
    gains at the statutory tax rate for capital gains in the
    property’s jurisdiction and reduced by 50% to represent a
    customary buyer and seller split of proceeds on potential future
    dispositions.

•

Additional differences under Luxembourg GAAP are discussed in
    Note 2.

    present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2007, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for the period from May 31, 2007 to

    generally accepted in Luxembourg. These financial statements are
    the responsibility of the Board of Managers of AMB
    Fund Management S.à r.1. (the “Management
    Company”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
    these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
    audit of these statements in accordance with the standards of
    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
    obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable

    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS OF
    DECEMBER 31, 2007

1.

ORGANISATION

AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS (the “Fund”) was
    formed on May 31, 2007 (“Incorporation”) as a

fonds commun de placement

organised under the form of a

fonds d’ investissement specialisé

subject to
    the law of February 13, 2007 of the Grand Duchy of
    Luxembourg concerning specialised investment funds. The Fund is
    an unincorporated co-ownership of securities and other assets,
    managed in the interest of its co-owners (the
    “Unitholders”) by AMB Fund Management, S.à r.l. a
    Luxembourg private limited company (the “Management
    Company”), pursuant to the Management Regulations of the
    Fund, as the same may be modified or supplemented (“the
    Management Regulations”).

Between May 31, 2007 and June 11, 2007 no financial
    transactions took place within the Fund.

On June 12, 2007 (“Inception”), the Fund
    completed its first closing and accepted capital contributions
    from 20 Unitholders to acquire indirect real property interests.
    Also at Inception, AMB European Investments, LLC (“AMB
    Europe”) was admitted to the Fund as a Unitholder in
    exchange for the indirect contribution of 38 industrial
    buildings. At Inception, total equity committed to the Fund by
    all Unitholders, including AMB Europe, was
    €315.1 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund
    had received capital contributions of approximately
    €284.3 million in exchange for 283,675 Units in the
    Fund. Profits and distributions of the Fund are allocated to
    Unitholders as provided in the Management Regulations. AMB
    Europe owned an approximate 21.4 percent interest in the
    Fund as of December 31, 2007.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

The consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    Luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements (“Lux
    GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements
    include the financial position and results of operations of the
    Fund and the joint ventures in which the Fund has a controlling
    interest. Third party equity interests in the Fund’s joint
    ventures are reflected as minority interests in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
    amounts have been eliminated. All monetary figures are expressed
    in Euro.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with Lux GAAP requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Valuation of Real Estate Investments.

Real
    estate investments not publicly traded are carried at their
    estimated fair value in accordance with Luxembourg legal and
    regulatory requirements for investment funds.

The fair value of real estate investments held by the Fund are
    determined in accordance with the Fund’s appraisal policy
    as approved by the Management Company and the three member
    Independent Council for the Fund (the “Appraisal
    Policy”). Under the Appraisal Policy, approximately one
    fourth of the Fund’s properties are valued by the
    Fund’s independent appraiser (the “Independent
    Appraiser”) each quarter, such that all properties are
    valued at least annually. With respect to all properties
    acquired by the Fund, the Management Company will determine the
    quarter during which each such property will first be appraised,
    provided that it is appraised within the first five calendar
    quarters beginning after the acquisition of such property by the
    Fund.

Appraisals are conducted by the Independent Appraiser in
    accordance with valuation principles set forth in the Appraisal
    and Valuation Manual as published by the Royal Institute of
    Chartered Surveyors or such other standards as may be proposed
    by the Management Company and approved by the Independent
    Council.

Recently acquired investments are accounted for and carried at
    cost, including costs of acquisition plus capital expenditures
    subsequent to acquisition, as this is the best estimate of fair
    value.

S-106


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Once a property has been appraised, the value of the property is
    the net value of the property shown in the appraisal, adjusted
    (if appropriate) to take into account unamortized closing costs
    and transfer tax savings, if any, resulting from the structure
    of the acquisition of the property, plus capital expenditures
    subsequent to the appraisal not otherwise taken into account in
    the appraisal. Closing costs are costs incurred in connection
    with the acquisition of a property indirectly through a share
    transaction or directly through an asset deal. Transfer tax
    savings result in certain cases depending on the structure of
    the acquisition transaction, and are assumed to generally be
    split between a buyer and a seller of real estate, of the
    estimated transfer taxes on a fifty-fifty basis. The property
    values are reviewed and approved by the Management Company and
    the Independent Council.

Ultimate realisation of the fair values is dependent to a great
    extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond
    management’s control (such as general economic conditions,
    conditions affecting tenants and other events occurring in the
    markets in which individual properties are located). Further,
    values may or may not represent the prices at which the real
    estate investments would be sold since market prices of real
    estate investments can only be determined by negotiation between
    a willing buyer and seller.

Unrealised gains and losses are determined by comparing the fair
    value of the real estate investments to the total acquisition
    cost plus capital expenditures of such assets and are shown net
    of deferred tax liabilities. Unrealised gains and losses
    relating to changes in fair value of the Fund’s real estate
    investments are reflected in the consolidated statement of
    operations as a component of unrealised gains and losses on
    investments in real estate.

Real Estate Transactions.

Purchases of real
    estate investments are recorded at purchase price when title to
    the real estate has been transferred to the Fund. Deal costs in
    relation to pre-acquisition such as legal and other professional
    fees, appraisals and other direct expenses incurred for
    prospective acquisitions of properties are capitalised and
    included within the cost of the corresponding investment upon
    acquisition. In the event that the deal is abandoned, the costs
    are then charged to the consolidated statement of operations.

Capital Expenditures.

Expenditures which
    extend the economic life of the asset, or which represent
    additional capital improvements providing benefit in future
    periods (including tenant improvements) are capitalised together
    with the cost of investments purchased.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

All cash on hand,
    demand deposits with financial institutions and short term,
    highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
    months or less are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash.

Restricted cash includes cash
    held in escrow by notaries or in connection with reserves from
    loan proceeds for certain capital improvements and real estate
    tax payments.

Fund Formation Costs.

The formation costs
    of the Fund are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
    basis over a five-year period starting at Inception.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs resulting from
    debt issues are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
    basis over the period of the corresponding debt.

Deferred Tax Asset.

Deferred tax assets are
    included in the consolidated statement of net assets when it is
    probable that future taxable income will be recognised in the
    foreseeable future.

Taxation in Luxembourg.

The Fund is liable for
    a subscription tax of 0.01 percent per annum computed, and
    proportionately paid on its net assets value at the end of each
    quarter.

Luxembourg subsidiaries of the Fund are fully subject to
    Luxembourg taxes on income and net worth, however exemptions are
    available. Dividend payments to the Fund from the Luxembourg

Taxation abroad.

Provisions for taxation are
    made for income earned by the Fund’s subsidiaries abroad on
    the basis of laws and regulations relating to taxation in the
    countries where the relevant net income is earned.

Deferred Tax Liability.

The deferred tax
    liability as of December 31, 2007 is related to built-in
    unrealised gain on the properties. The unrealised taxable gains
    are valued at the statutory tax rate for capital gains in the
    jurisdiction in which the property is located and reduced by
    50.0 percent to represent a customary buyer and seller
    split of proceeds on potential future dispositions.

Debt.

Debt consists of external secured debt
    stated at face value, adjusted for unrealised gains or losses
    reflecting the change in the fair market value of the debt.

Minority Interests.

Minority interests
    represent interests held by affiliates of AMB and third-party
    investors in various entities of the Fund. The Fund consolidates
    these investments because the Fund owns a majority interest and
    exercises significant control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Unitholders’ Capital.

Profits and losses
    of the Fund are allocated to each of the Unitholders in
    accordance with the Management Regulations. Distributions to
    Unitholders are typically made quarterly. Distributions, other
    than incentive distributions (Note 14), are paid or accrued
    to each of the Unitholders in accordance with their respective
    units owned at the time distributions are declared.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

The Fund may
    acquire derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to
    interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate loans. These
    financial instruments are recorded at fair value with any
    unrealised and realised gains or losses included in the
    consolidated statement of operations.

Rental Revenue and Income Recognition.

The
    Fund, as a lessor, retains substantially all of the benefits and
    risks of ownership of the Properties and accounts for its leases
    as operating leases. Rental income as well as rent incentives
    are recognised on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
    leases until the first break right, if any, in the lease.
    Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other
    recoverable operating expenses are recognised as revenue in the
    period that the applicable expenses are incurred. Interest
    income is recorded on an accrual basis. Interest received is
    stated net of withholding taxes. In addition, the Fund includes
    bad debt expense in property operating costs.

Foreign currency translation.

Transactions on
    foreign currencies have been translated into Euros at the rates
    of exchange prevailing at the dates of those transactions.

INVESTMENTS
    IN REAL ESTATE

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund owned 55 industrial

    includes approximately €2.2 million in closing costs
    and acquisition fees related to these acquisitions.

For the period from Incorporation to December 31, 2007,
    nine properties were valued or revalued, resulting in an
    increase in the fair market value of approximately
    €6.1 million. In accordance with the Appraisal Policy
    the Management Company did not consider any off-cycle appraisals
    necessary for the part of the portfolio that was not appraised

AMB Property L.P. (“AMB L.P.”) obtains various types
    of liability and property insurance for the benefit of the Fund.
    The insurance coverage includes Commercial General Liability
    Insurance, Umbrella Liability and Excess Liability Insurance and
    Broad Form All Risk Property Damage and Business
    Interruption Insurance, which include earthquake, flood,
    terrorism, and boiler and machinery. The Property Damage and
    Business Interruption Insurance provides for a $150,000,000 each
    occurrence limit of liability subject to industry standard per
    occurrence and aggregate policy

sub-limits,

deductibles, definitions, exclusions and limitations. Property
    damage is valued on a replacement cost basis. Using this method
    for valuing loss, damages for a claim equal amount needed to
    replace the property using new materials without a reduction for
    depreciation.

AMB L.P. regularly evaluates the types and amounts of coverage
    that it carries, and to assess whether in AMB L.P.’s good
    faith discretion, the coverage and limits carried are
    appropriate for the Fund.

DEBT

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had a
    €428.0 million credit facility with ING Bank N.V.
    (“Facility 1”), which provides that certain of the
    Fund’s affiliates may borrow either acquisition loans, up
    to a €100.0 million

sub-limit

(the “Acquisition Loan Facility”), or secured term
    loans, in connection with properties located in France, Germany,
    the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, or Spain.
    Loan draws under Facility 1 bear interest at a rate of
    65 basis points over EURIBOR and may occur until its
    maturity on April 30, 2014. Drawings under the Acquisition
    Loan Facility bear interest at a rate of 75 basis points
    over EURIBOR and are repayable within six months of the date of
    advance, unless extended. The Fund guarantees the Acquisition
    Loan Facility and is a carve-out indemnitor with respect to the
    secured term loans. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had
    €295.9 million in outstanding term loans under
    Facility 1, including €24.7 million outstanding under
    the Acquisition Loan Facility. Facility 1 contains customary and
    other affirmative covenants and negative covenants, including
    financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specific
    ratios. The Management Company of the Fund believes that it was
    in compliance with these financial covenants as of
    December 31, 2007.

On August 9, 2007, the Fund executed with Aareal Bank A.G.
    a €275.0 million facility (“Facility 2”),
    which provides that certain of the Fund’s affiliates may
    borrow secured term loans in connection with properties located
    in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United
    Kingdom, Italy or Spain. Drawings under Facility 2 may
    occur until its maturity on November 28, 2014, and those
    made in the first year are expected to bear interest at a rate
    of 75 basis points over EURIBOR. The Fund is a carve-out
    indemnitor in respect to the secured term loans. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Fund had €133.0 million in
    outstanding term loans under Facility 2. Facility 2 contains
    customary and other affirmative covenants and negative
    covenants, including financial reporting requirements and
    maintenance of specific ratios.

In addition to both facilities, the Fund had two mortgage loans
    outstanding, as of December 31, 2007 totaling
    €28.3 million, which mature between 2008 and 2017.
    These loans are held with IKB Bank A.G. and Credit Fonciere de
    France for €13.9 million and €14.4 million,
    respectively. These mortgage loans, together with the loans
    outstanding under both facilities, bear interest at a weighted
    average rate of 5.1 percent.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund’s derivative
    financial instruments included two interest rate swaps with ING
    Bank N.V. and IKB Bank A.G., that hedged the cash flows of the
    Fund’s variable rate borrowings based on EURIBOR plus a
    margin. The Fund also entered into an interest rate swap with
    Aareal Bank A.G. , which will have an effective commencement
    date of January 31, 2008. Adjustments to the fair value of
    these instruments for the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007 resulted in a net unrealised gain of
    approximately €3.0 million.

FUND NET
    ASSET VALUE

The net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund is determined
    based on the values of the properties (determined in accordance
    with the Appraisal Policy), and takes into account, among other
    things, the value of the Fund’s cash and short-term
    investments, an intangible asset valued based on the formation
    costs of the Fund, the carrying value of all other assets of the
    Fund, and the liabilities of the Fund, including an adjustment
    to reflect the cost or value on any above- or below- market
    indebtedness of the Fund, a ratable portion of the present value
    of the projected incentive distribution, and a provision for
    deferred tax liabilities relating to the acquisition of
    properties as determined in accordance with the Appraisal
    Policy. The Fund’s NAV is determined by the Investment
    Advisor (as defined in Note 14) and is reviewed and
    approved by the Management Company and the Independent Council.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH AFFILIATES

Pursuant to the Management Regulations, the Management Company
    is entitled to receive an annual management fee (the
    “Management Fee”), payable quarterly in arrears, in an
    amount equal to 0.75 percent per annum of the gross value
    of the Fund’s assets (determined in accordance with the
    Management Regulations) as of the end of each calendar quarter.
    The Fund incurred Management Fees of approximately
    €3.0 million for the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007.

Also under the Management Regulations, the Management Company is
    entitled to receive an acquisition fee (the “Acquisition
    Fee”) in an amount equal to 0.9 percent of the
    acquisition cost of properties acquired by the Fund for
    identifying, analyzing, recommending and closing the purchase of
    properties acquired directly or indirectly by

S-112


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Fund from a third party. Acquisition Fees are capitalised
    and included in investments in real estate in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of net assets. During the period from
    Incorporation to December 31, 2007, the Fund capitalised
    approximately €1.3 million in acquisition fees.

Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement (the
    “Advisory Agreement”), the Management Company has
    retained AMB Property Europe B.V. (the “Investment
    Advisor”) to provide operations and asset management
    services and acquisition advisory services to the Fund and its
    subsidiaries and fund advisory services to the Management
    Company. To the extent services are provided directly to the
    subsidiaries of the Fund, the Investment Advisor or its
    affiliated delegates providing such services may charge fees,
    without duplication, directly to the subsidiaries to which the
    services are provided.

At certain properties, affiliates of AMB L.P. are responsible
    for the property management or the accounting or both. On a
    quarterly basis, AMB L.P. earns property management fees between
    0.1 percent and 2.8 percent of the respective
    property’s base rent. For the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007, AMB L.P. earned property management fees
    of approximately €0.3 million.

At certain properties, AMB L.P. earns a leasing commission when
    it has acted as the listing broker or the procuring broker or
    both. During the period from Incorporation to December 31,
    2007, AMB L.P. earned no leasing commissions.

Commencing June 30, 2010 and every three years thereafter,
    AMB Europe is entitled to receive an incentive distribution of
    20.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 25.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR. As of December 31,
    2007, no incentive distribution has been paid to AMB Europe. The
    Fund accrued approximately €0.9 million in incentive
    distributions to AMB Europe for the period from Incorporation to
    December 31, 2007.

AMB L.P. has a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. (“Arcata”), which provides
    insurance coverage for a portion of losses under our third-party
    policies. AMB L.P. capitalised Arcata in accordance with the
    applicable regulatory requirements. Annually, AMB L.P. engages
    an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of
    future projected claims, related deductibles and projected
    expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs.
    Consistent with third party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB L.P. based on AMB L.P.’s assessment of the
    specific risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated
    to the Properties was approximately €0.3 million for
    the period from Incorporation to December 31, 2007.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Fund may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions would have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows of the Fund.

Environmental Matters.

The Fund follows AMB
    L.P.’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Fund is not aware of any
    environmental liability with respect to the Properties that
    would have a material adverse effect on The Fund’s
    business, assets or results of operations. However, there can

S-114


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

be no assurance that such a material environmental liability
    does not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability would have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
    results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Fund carries
    property and rental loss, liability, flood, environmental and
    terrorism insurance. The Fund believes that the policy terms and
    conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and appropriate
    under the circumstances, given the relative risk of loss, the
    cost of such coverage and industry practice. There are, however,
    certain types of extraordinary losses, such as those due to acts
    of war that may be either uninsurable or not economically
    insurable. Although the Fund has obtained coverage for certain
    acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits
    that the Fund believes are commercially reasonable, it is not
    certain that the Fund will be able to collect under such
    policies. Should an uninsured loss occur, the Fund could lose
    its investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from,
    a property. AMB Europe has adopted certain policies with respect
    to insurance coverage and proceeds as part of its operating
    policies, which apply to properties owned or managed by AMB
    Europe, including properties owned by the Fund.

17.

Differences
    from United States Accounting Principles

Luxembourg GAAP varies in certain significant respects from the
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“US GAAP”). The approximate effect of these principal
    differences on the Fund’s Audited Consolidated Statement of
    Net Assets and Audited Consolidated Statement of Operations are
    quantified below and described in the accompanying notes.

A.

The
    differences between US GAAP and Luxembourg GAAP are summarised
    as follows:

Under US GAAP:

•

Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at
    cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be
    recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is
    reduced to estimated fair value. At acquisition an intangible
    asset or liability for the value attributable to above or
    below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs
    for all acquisitions is recorded. Carrying values for financial
    reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash
    flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
    the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected
    future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on
    assumptions regarding current and future economics and market
    conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment
    analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying
    value of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period
    in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property
    is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property
    over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings.

•

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. Investments that are owned by federal, state
    or local port authorities, and subject to ground leases are
    depreciated over the lesser of 40 years or the contractual
    term of the underlying ground lease. Depreciation of tenant
    improvements is recorded of the remaining lease term.
    Amortisation of above and below-market leases is recorded in
    rental revenues over the average remaining lease term. In-place
    leases are amortised over the average remaining lease term.

•

Debt premiums represent the excess of the fair value of debt
    over the principal value of debt assumed in connection with the
    Fund’s formation and subsequent property acquisitions. The
    debt premiums are being amortised as an offset to interest
    expense over the term of the related debt instrument using the
    straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest
    method. Costs incurred related to

start-up

activities, including organizational costs, are expensed as
    incurred. Costs incurred relating to raising capital are
    recorded as an offset to Unitholderss Capital. Financial
    instruments are recorded in accordance with

S-115


AMB
    EUROPE FUND I, FCP-FIS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and for Hedging Activities. This standard provides comprehensive
    guidelines for the recognition and measurement of derivatives
    and hedging activities and, specifically, requires all
    derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as
    an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other
    comprehensive income or loss.

•

Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets can be recorded as
    an offset to deferred tax assets. The Fund is not subject to tax
    and therefore does not record deferred tax liability related to
    the ultimate sale of assets.

•

Minority interest is renamed noncontrolling interests and
    reclassified in the statement of net assets to be part of net
    assets. Additionally, the presentation of net investment income
    would include the portion of income attributable to
    noncontrolling interests.

Under Luxembourg GAAP:

•

All real estate investments, including debt investments and
    derivatives, are revalued to fair market value and the premium
    generated from the acquisition of entities at a price below fair
    market value of acquired assets and liabilities is recognised as
    an unrealised gain.

•

Organizational costs and other fund formation costs are
    capitalized and amortised on a straight-line basis over a
    5 year period.

•

Deferred tax liabilities are recorded on unrealized taxable
    gains at the statutory tax rate for capital gains in the
    property’s jurisdiction and reduced by 50% to represent a
    customary buyer and seller split of proceeds on potential future
    dispositions.

•

Additional differences under Luxembourg GAAP are discussed in

(Report not required)

1.

ORGANIZATION

On December 31, 2004 (“Date of Inception”), AMB
    Property, L.P. (“AMB”) and Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte
    Ltd (“GIC”), formed AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, a Delaware
    limited liability company (the “Company”), for the
    purpose of investing in industrial properties in Mexico.

At the Date of Inception, AMB and GIC made cash equity
    contributions, net of transaction costs, of $1.5 million
    and $6.2 million, respectively, and acquired three
    properties comprised of eight buildings totaling
    1.3 million square feet (unaudited).

Pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the
    “Agreement”), AMB and GIC have investment capital
    commitments to the Company of $50.0 million and
    $200.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009,
    the remaining investment capital commitments from AMB and GIC
    were $24.6 million and $98.1 million, respectively.

AMB is the general manager of the Company with a
    19.19 percent managing member and limited member interest.
    GIC is an 80.81 percent limited member. According to the
    Agreement, the term of the Company will continue until
    December 31, 2011, unless extended or terminated sooner as
    provided for in the Agreement. AMB provides asset and portfolio
    management services for the Company’s real estate
    investments.

The Company owns 99.0 percent of the membership interests
    in the following Delaware limited liability corporations: AMB
    Mexico, L.L.C., AMB Chapala, LLC, AMB GDL 1, LLC, AMB
    Ferrocarril, LLC, AMB Corregidora, LLC, AMB Frontera, LLC, AMB
    Arbolada, LLC, AMB Los Altos 1, LLC, AMB Ocotillo, LLC and AMB
    GDL 2, LLC (the “U.S. LLCs”). In connection with
    the Company’s holdings in AMB Ferrocarril, LLC and in
    accordance with the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability
    Company Agreement, AMB will be treated as if it had contributed
    a 99.0 percent membership interest in the U.S. LLCs in
    exchange for the real estate assets held by the Mexican limited
    liability entities covered under the Agreement. The
    U.S. LLCs in turn hold a 98.0 percent equity interest in
    the following Mexican limited liability entities (the
    “SRLs”): AMB Acción San Martín
    Obispo I, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Centro
    Logístico Parque 1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción GDL
    1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción San Martin Obispo
    II, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Corregidora Distribution
    Center, S. de R.L. de C.V. , AMB-Acción Apodaca Industrial
    Park 2, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Arbolada
    Distribution Center, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Los
    Altos Industrial Park 1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB Ocotillo, S. de
    R.L. de C.V. and AMB Acción GDL 2, de R.L. de C.V.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company owned 26 industrial
    buildings (the “Properties”), 13 in Guadalajara, 11 in
    Mexico City, 1 in Queretaro and 1 in Tijuana, totaling
    approximately 6.3 million square feet (unaudited).

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of the Company and the Company’s
    controlled subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests are reflected
    as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements. All significant intercompany amounts have
    been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and
    Transactions.

The U.S. dollar is the
    functional currency for the Company’s Mexican operations as
    it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which
    the Company

S-124


AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Mexican
    pesos are remeasured using the exchange rate at the balance
    sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are reported at
    historical U.S. dollar balances. Income and expenses
    denominated in Mexican pesos are remeasured in a manner that
    approximates the weighted average exchange rates for the
    quarter. Foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains
    and losses are included in other income (expense) in the
    consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company reported foreign currency
    remeasurement and transaction losses of approximately
    $0.4 million.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to
    the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its
    estimated fair value.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

Prior to January 1, 2009, the initial cost of buildings and
    improvements included the purchase price of the property or
    interest in the property including legal fees and acquisition
    costs. Pursuant to the Company’s adoption of policies
    related to accounting for business combinations, legal fees and
    acquisition costs are now expensed and included in general and
    administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations.

Project costs associated with the development and construction
    of a real estate project, which include interest and property
    taxes, are capitalized as construction in progress.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or improvements
    that extend the economic useful life of assets are capitalized.

The Company records at acquisition an intangible asset for the
    value attributable to in-place leases and lease origination
    costs. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded
    intangible assets in the amounts of $7.8 million and
    $9.5 million for the value attributable to in-place leases
    and lease origination costs, respectively, which are included in
    buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet.

Real Estate Impairment Losses.

Carrying values
    for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on
    a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    When the carrying value of a property is greater than its
    estimated fair value, based on the intended use and holding
    period, an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the
    excess over its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The
    intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the
    long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured.
    If an asset is intended to be held for the long term, the
    impairment analysis is based on a two-step test. The first test
    measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding
    period, including a residual value (undiscounted and without
    interest charges), against the carrying value of the property.
    If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is
    measured against the lower of cost or the present value of
    expected cash flows over the expected hold period. An impairment
    charge to earnings is recognized for the excess of the
    asset’s carrying value over the lower of cost or the
    present value of expected cash flows over the expected hold
    period. If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is
    determined using the estimated fair value less costs to sell.
    The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently
    uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future
    economic and market conditions and the availability of capital.
    The

S-125


AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

management of the Company determines estimated fair values based
    on its assumptions regarding rental rates,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices. The management of the
    Company believes that there were no impairments of the carrying
    values of its investments in real estate as of December 31,
    2009.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    term of the related loan. As of December 31, 2009, deferred
    financing costs were $0.9 million, net of accumulated
    amortization.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent interests held by AMB and affiliates of AMB
    (“AMB Mexico”) in various Company entities. Such
    investments are consolidated because the Company owns a majority
    interest and exercises control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Members’ Deficit.

Profits and losses of
    the Company are allocated to each of the members in accordance
    with the Agreement. Distributions are made to each of the
    members in accordance with the Agreement.

Rental Revenues.

The Company, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period in which the applicable
    expenses are incurred. In addition, the Company nets its bad
    debt expense against rental income for financial reporting
    purposes. No bad debt expense was recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Income Taxes.

No provision for
    U.S. federal income taxes has been recorded on the books of
    the Company, since the members’ respective shares of
    taxable income are reportable by the members on their respective
    tax returns. The Company accounts for Mexican income taxes for
    its Mexican subsidiaries using the asset and liability method.
    Under this method, income and flat taxes are provided for
    amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred as tax assets
    and liabilities based on differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets
    and liabilities and the value of net operating loss
    carry-forward balances. Deferred income taxes are measured using
    the tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the
    temporary differences will reverse

and/or

the
    net operating loss carry-forward balances will be utilized. A
    valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to
    amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted policies
    related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which
    clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
    positions, and such adoption did not have a material impact on
    the Company.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Company in
    its trade areas. The existence of competing properties could
    have a material impact on the Company’s ability to lease
    space and on the level of rent that can be received. The Company
    has one tenant that accounted for 14.0 percent of rental
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s financial instruments
    include mortgage loans payable and lines of credit. Based on
    borrowing rates available to the Company at December 31,
    2009, the estimated fair value of the mortgage loans payable and
    lines of credit was $215.2 million.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted policies related to
    accounting for business combinations, which changes the
    accounting for business combinations including the measurement
    of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business
    combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the
    accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
    accounting for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals,
    the treatment of acquisition-related transaction costs and the
    recognition of changes in

S-126


AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance. This
    adoption did not have a material effect on the Company’s
    financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted policies
    related to accounting for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as capital in
    the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
    adoption, the Company has retroactively renamed the minority
    interests as noncontrolling interests and has reclassified these
    balances within the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, on
    the consolidated statement of operations, the presentation of
    net loss retroactively includes the portion of loss attributable
    to noncontrolling interests.

Effective June 2009, the Company adopted a policy related to
    disclosures of subsequent events, which involves accounting for
    and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
    but before financial statements are issued or are available to
    be issued. This adoption did not have any impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (“Codification”), which identifies the
    sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
    the principles used in the preparation of its financial
    statements that are presented in conformity with GAAP. Effective
    September 2009, the Company has adopted the Codification, which
    did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

INCOME
    AND FLAT TAXES

In November 2009, the Mexican legislative branch approved the
    2010 Mexican Tax Reform Bill. The primary change in the Mexican
    tax law that impacts the Company is the income tax rate change.
    The corporate income tax rate will be increased from
    28.0 percent to 30.0 percent for the period from
    January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2012, and will
    then be scaled back to 29.0 percent in 2013, and finally
    back to 28.0 percent in 2014 and future years. Accordingly,
    the deferred taxes were measured at 30.0 percent as of
    December 31, 2009.

As a U.S. limited liability company, the allocated share of
    income or loss of the Company is included in the income tax
    returns of the individual equity interest owners. The
    Company’s Mexican subsidiaries are subject to Mexican
    statutory income and flat tax laws.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had prepaid taxes to
    the Government of Mexico in the amount of $2.4 million,
    which is offset against current taxes payable in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The Company’s current income tax provision was computed
    based on the Mexican statutory rate of 28.0 percent. The
    flat tax provision was computed at the Mexican statutory rate of
    17.0 percent.

Mexican income and flat tax expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 were as follows:

(Dollars in thousands)

Current income and flat tax expense

(2,341

)

Deferred income tax expense

(1,450

)

Total expense for income and flat taxes

$

(3,791

)

For tax purposes, as of December 31, 2009, the Company has
    Mexican net operating loss carry-forwards of $35.6 million,
    which will be available to offset future taxable income. If not
    used, this carry-forward will expire between 2012 and 2019.

The Company’s deferred tax assets primarily relate to the
    value of tax net operating losses. The Company’s deferred
    tax liabilities relate to the differences between the basis for
    financial reporting purposes and tax reporting purposes. As of
    December 31, 2009, management believes that it is more
    likely than not that any deferred tax asset that exceeds the
    deferred tax liability will not be realized and therefore is
    offset with a valuation allowance. This analysis is completed
    for each Mexican subsidiary.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTIES

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company records
    management/consulting fees to AMB and AMB Mexico at a rate of
    7.35 percent and 0.15 percent, respectively, of the
    net operating income of each SRL. The management/consulting fees
    are payable on a quarterly basis. Management/consulting fees are
    included in general and administrative expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The Company
    recorded management/consulting fees to AMB and AMB Mexico of
    $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

In addition, the Agreement states that AMB and AMB Mexico will
    receive in aggregate acquisition fees equal to 0.9 percent
    of the acquisition cost of any assets purchased by the Company
    other than assets purchased from an AMB-affiliated entity. The
    Company paid no acquisition fees to AMB and AMB Mexico during
    the year ended December 31, 2009. Prior to January 1,
    2009, acquisition fees are capitalized and included in
    investments in real estate in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet. Pursuant to the Company’s adoption of
    policies related to accounting for business combinations,
    acquisition costs are now expensed and included in general and
    administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations.

AMB will be entitled to receive a promote distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR, reflecting the
    hypothetical dissolution of the Company at December 31,
    2011, or actual dissolution of the Company. As of
    December 31, 2009, no promote distribution had been earned
    by AMB.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had obligations to AMB
    of $2.6 million, which is primarily related to the unpaid
    portion of the purchase price of the properties acquired at the
    Date of Inception.

The SRLs are charged property management and accounting fees
    from AMB Mexico. The property management and accounting fees are
    calculated at a rate of 3.0 percent of net rental income as
    defined in the various SRL project agreements. Property
    management and accounting fees are included as part of property
    operating costs in

AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The
    Company incurred property management and accounting fees to AMB
    Mexico of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31,
    2009.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third-party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include
    liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, and accrued
    but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
    business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to approximately $0.2 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009.

8.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Company may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a
    material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters.

The Company follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Company is not aware of
    any environmental liability with respect to the SRLs that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business
    assets or results of operations. However, there can be no
    assurance that such a material environmental liability does not
    exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Company carries
    liability, flood, environmental, terrorism and property and
    rental loss insurance. The Company believes that the policy
    terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and
    appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk of
    loss and the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Company’s properties are located
    in areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Company has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of war that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although the Company
    has obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits, that the Company believes are
    commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the Company will
    be able to collect under such policies. If an uninsured loss
    occurs, the Company could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Company.

    EVENTS

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company
    evaluated subsequent events occurring through February 11,
    2010, the date these financial statements were issued, in
    accordance with the Company’s policy related to disclosures
    of subsequent events.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Members of

AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of
    members’ capital and noncontrolling interests and of cash
    flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC and its subsidiaries
    (collectively, the “Company”) at December 31,
    2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
    the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements, the
    Company adopted accounting standards related to noncontrolling
    interests effective January 1, 2009. All amounts have been
    reclassified herein to conform to 2009 presentation.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER

1.

ORGANIZATION

On December 31, 2004 (“Date of Inception”), AMB
    Property, L.P. (“AMB”) and Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte
    Ltd (“GIC”), formed AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, a Delaware
    limited liability company (the “Company”), for the
    purpose of investing in industrial properties in Mexico.

At the Date of Inception, AMB and GIC made cash equity
    contributions, net of transaction costs, of $1.5 million
    and $6.2 million, respectively, and acquired three
    properties comprised of eight buildings totaling
    1.3 million square feet (unaudited).

Pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the
    “Agreement”), AMB and GIC have investment capital
    commitments to the Company of $50.0 million and
    $200.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008,
    the remaining investment capital commitments from AMB and GIC
    were $24.6 million and $98.1 million, respectively.

AMB is the general manager of the Company with a
    19.19 percent managing member and limited member interest.
    GIC is an 80.81 percent limited member. According to the
    Agreement, the term of the Company will continue until
    December 31, 2011, unless extended or terminated sooner as
    provided for in the Agreement. AMB provides asset and portfolio
    management services for the Company’s real estate
    investments.

The Company owns 99.0 percent of the membership interests
    in the following Delaware limited liability corporations: AMB
    Mexico, L.L.C., AMB Chapala, LLC, AMB GDL 1, LLC, AMB
    Ferrocarril, LLC, AMB Corregidora, LLC, AMB Frontera, LLC, AMB
    Arbolada, LLC, AMB Los Altos 1, LLC, AMB Ocotillo, LLC and AMB
    GDL 2, LLC (the “U.S. LLCs”). In connection with
    the Company’s holdings in AMB Ferrocarril, LLC and in
    accordance with the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability
    Company Agreement, AMB will be treated as if it had contributed
    a 99.0 percent membership interest in the U.S. LLCs in
    exchange for the real estate assets held by the Mexican limited
    liability entities covered under the Agreement. The
    U.S. LLCs in turn hold a 98.0 percent equity interest
    in the following Mexican limited liability entities (the
    “SRLs”): AMB Acción San Martín
    Obispo I, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB- Acción Centro
    Logístico Parque 1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción GDL
    1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción San Martin Obispo
    II, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Corregidora Distribution
    Center, S. de R.L. de C.V. , AMB-Acción Apodaca Industrial
    Park 2, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Arbolada
    Distribution Center, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Los
    Altos Industrial Park 1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB Ocotillo, S. de
    R.L. de C.V. and AMB Acción GDL 2, de R.L. de C.V.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company owned 26 industrial
    buildings (the “Properties”), 13 in Guadalajara, 11 in
    Mexico City, 1 in Queretaro and 1 in Tijuana, totaling
    approximately 6.3 million square feet (unaudited).

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of the Company and the Company’s
    controlled subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests are reflected
    as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements. All significant intercompany amounts have
    been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and
    Transactions.

The U.S. dollar is the
    functional currency for the Company’s Mexican operations as
    it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which
    the Company operates. Monetary assets and liabilities
    denominated in Mexican pesos are remeasured using the exchange
    rate at

S-137


AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are
    reported at historical U.S. dollar balances. Income and
    expenses denominated in Mexican pesos are remeasured in a manner
    that approximates the weighted average exchange rates for the
    quarter. Foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains
    and losses are included in other income (expense) in the
    consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company reported foreign currency
    remeasurement and transaction losses of approximately
    $1.2 million.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to
    the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its
    estimated fair value.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in the property
    including legal fees and acquisition costs.

Project costs associated with the development and construction
    of a real estate project, which include interest and property
    taxes, are capitalized as construction in progress.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or improvements
    that extend the economic useful life of assets are capitalized.

The Company records at acquisition an intangible asset for the
    value attributable to in-place leases and lease origination
    costs. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded
    intangible assets in the amounts of $7.8 million and
    $9.5 million for the value attributable to in-place leases
    and lease origination costs, respectively, which are included in
    buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet.

Real Estate Impairment Losses.

Carrying values
    for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on
    a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    When the carrying value of a property is greater than its
    estimated fair value, based on the intended use and holding
    period, an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the
    excess over its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The
    intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the
    long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured.
    If an asset is intended to be held for the long term, the
    impairment analysis is based on a two-step test. The first test
    measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding
    period, including a residual value (undiscounted and without
    interest charges), against the carrying value of the property.
    If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is
    measured against the lower of cost or the present value of
    expected cash flows over the expected hold period. An impairment
    charge to earnings is recognized for the excess of the
    asset’s carrying value over the lower of cost or the
    present value of expected cash flows over the expected hold
    period. If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is
    determined using the estimated fair value less costs to sell.
    The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently
    uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future
    economic and market conditions and the availability of capital.
    The management of the Company determines estimated fair values
    based on its assumptions regarding rental rates,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices. The management of the
    Company believes that there were no impairments of the carrying
    values of its investments in real estate as of December 31,
    2008.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    term of the related loan. As of December 31, 2008, deferred
    financing costs were $1.3 million, net of accumulated
    amortization.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent interests held by AMB and AMB Property
    Mexico (“AMB Mexico”), formerly known as G.
    Acción, S.A. de C.V. (“G. Acción”), in
    various Company entities. Such investments are consolidated
    because the Company owns a majority interest and exercises
    control through the ability to control major operating decisions.

Members’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Company are allocated to each of the members in accordance
    with the Agreement. Distributions are made to each of the
    members in accordance with the Agreement.

Rental Revenues.

The Company, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period in which the applicable
    expenses are incurred. In addition, the Company nets its bad
    debt expense against rental income for financial reporting
    purposes. No bad debt expense was recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Income Taxes.

No provision for
    U.S. federal income taxes has been recorded on the books of
    the Company, since the members’ respective shares of
    taxable income are reportable by the members on their respective
    tax returns. The Company accounts for Mexican income taxes for
    its Mexican subsidiaries using the asset and liability method.
    Under this method, income and flat taxes are provided for
    amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred as tax assets
    and liabilities based on differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets
    and liabilities and the value of net operating loss
    carry-forward balances. Deferred income taxes are measured using
    the tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the
    temporary differences will reverse

and/or

the
    net operating loss carry-forward balances will be utilized. A
    valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to
    amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted policies
    related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which
    clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax
    positions, and such adoption did not have a material impact on
    the Company.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Company in
    its trade areas. The existence of competing properties could
    have a material impact on the Company’s ability to lease
    space and on the level of rent that can be received. The Company
    has one tenant that accounted for 14.1 percent of rental
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s financial instruments
    include mortgage loans payable and unsecured lines of credit.
    Based on borrowing rates available to the Company at
    December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of the mortgage
    loans payable and lines of credit was $215.0 million.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In December
    2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued a policy related to accounting for
    business combinations, which changes the accounting for business
    combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued
    in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of
    contingent consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition
    gain and loss contingencies, the accounting for
    acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment
    of acquisition-related transaction costs and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    This policy is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company
    is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of
    this policy will have on its financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows, but, at a minimum, it will require
    the expensing of transaction costs.

In March 2008, the FASB issued a policy related to accounting
    for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
    activities, which requires entities to provide enhanced
    disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted, and (c) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This
    policy is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is in
    the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this
    policy.

    approximately $0.6 million in closing costs related to
    these acquisitions. The $90.5 million total purchase price
    related to these acquisitions was allocated $13.8 million

INCOME
    AND FLAT TAXES

As a U.S. limited liability company, the allocated share of
    income or loss of the Company is included in the income tax
    returns of the individual equity interest owners. The
    Company’s Mexican subsidiaries are subject to Mexican
    statutory income and flat tax laws.

As of January 1, 2008, the business flat tax (IETU)
    replaced the asset tax and functions as an alternative minimum
    corporation tax.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had prepaid taxes to
    the Government of Mexico in the amount of $1.7 million,
    which is offset against current taxes payable in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The Company’s current income tax provision was computed
    based on the Mexican statutory rate of 28.0 percent. The
    flat tax provision was computed at the Mexican statutory rate of
    16.5 percent.

Mexican income and flat tax expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 were as follows:

(Dollars in thousands)

Current income and flat tax (expense)

$

(1,325

)

Deferred income tax benefit


Total (expense) benefit for income and flat taxes

$

(1,069

)

For tax purposes, as of December 31, 2008, the Company has
    Mexican net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
    $59.9 million, which will be available to offset future
    taxable income. If not used, this carry-forward will expire
    between 2012 and 2018.

The Company’s deferred tax assets primarily relate to the
    value of tax net operating losses. The Company’s deferred
    tax liabilities relate to the differences between the basis for
    financial reporting purposes and tax reporting purposes. As of
    December 31, 2008, management believes that it is more
    likely than not that any deferred tax asset that exceeds the
    deferred tax liability will not be realized and therefore is
    offset with a valuation allowance. This analysis is completed
    for each Mexican subsidiary.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTIES

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company records
    management/consulting fees to AMB and AMB Mexico at a rate of
    7.35 percent and 0.15 percent, respectively, of the
    net operating income of each SRL. The management/consulting fees
    are payable on a quarterly basis. Management/consulting fees are
    included in general and administrative expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The Company
    recorded management/consulting fees to AMB and AMB Mexico of
    $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

In addition, the Agreement states that AMB and AMB Mexico will
    receive in aggregate acquisition fees equal to 0.9 percent
    of the acquisition cost of any assets purchased by the Company
    other than assets purchased from an AMB-affiliated entity. The
    Company paid no acquisition fees to AMB and AMB Mexico for the
    year ended December 31, 2008.

AMB will be entitled to receive a promote distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR, reflecting the
    hypothetical dissolution of the Company at December 31,
    2011, or actual dissolution of the Company. As of
    December 31, 2008, no promote distribution had been earned
    by AMB.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had obligations to AMB
    of $2.8 million, primarily related to the unpaid portion of
    the purchase price of the properties acquired at the Date of
    Inception.

The SRLs are charged property management fees from AMB Mexico.
    The property management fees are calculated at a rate of
    3.0 percent of net rental income as defined in the various
    SRL project agreements. Property management fees are included as
    part of property operating costs in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of operations. The Company incurred
    property management fees to AMB Mexico of $1.0 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third-party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include
    liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, and accrued
    but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
    business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to approximately $0.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008.

9.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Company may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a
    material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters.

The Company follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Company is not aware of
    any environmental liability with respect to the SRLs that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business
    assets or results of operations. However, there

S-143


AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

can be no assurance that such a material environmental liability
    does not exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Company carries
    liability, flood, environmental, terrorism and property and
    rental loss insurance. The Company believes that the policy
    terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and
    appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk of
    loss and the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Company’s properties are located
    in areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Company has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of wars that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although, the Company
    has obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits, that the Company believes are
    commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the Company will
    be able to collect under such policies. If an uninsured loss
    occurs, the Company could lose its investment in, and
    anticipated profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has
    adopted certain policies with respect to insurance coverage and
    proceeds as part of its operating policies, which apply to
    properties owned or managed by AMB, including properties owned
    by the Company.

10.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted policies
    related to accounting for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as capital in
    the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
    adoption, the Company has retroactively renamed minority
    interests as noncontrolling interests and has reclassified these
    balances within the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, on
    the consolidated statement of operations, the presentation of
    net loss retroactively includes the portion of loss attributable
    to noncontrolling interests.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2007

(Report not required)

1.

ORGANIZATION

On December 31, 2004 (“Date of Inception”), AMB
    Property, L.P. (“AMB”) and Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte
    Ltd (“GIC”), formed AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, a Delaware
    limited liability company (the “Company”), for the
    purpose of investing in industrial properties in Mexico.

At the Date of Inception, AMB and GIC made cash equity
    contributions, net of transaction costs, of $1.5 million
    and $6.2 million, respectively, and acquired three
    properties comprised of eight buildings totaling
    1.3 million square feet (unaudited).

Pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the
    “Agreement”), AMB and GIC have investment capital
    commitments to the Company of $50.0 million and
    $200.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007,
    the remaining investment capital commitments from AMB and GIC
    were $31.0 million and $123.9 million, respectively.

AMB is the general manager of the Company with a
    19.19 percent managing member and limited member interest.
    GIC is an 80.81 percent limited member. According to the
    Agreement, the term of the Company will continue until
    December 31, 2011, unless extended or terminated sooner as
    provided for in the Agreement. AMB provides asset and portfolio
    management services for the Company’s real estate
    investments.

The Company owns 99.0 percent of the membership interests
    in the following Delaware limited liability corporations: AMB
    Mexico, L.L.C., AMB Chapala, LLC, AMB GDL 1, LLC, AMB
    Ferrocarril, LLC, AMB Corregidora, LLC, AMB Frontera, LLC, AMB
    Arbolada, LLC and AMB Los Altos 1, LLC (the
    “U.S. LLCs”). In connection with the
    Company’s holdings in AMB Ferrocarril, LLC and in
    accordance with the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability
    Company Agreement, AMB will be treated as if it had contributed
    a 99.0 percent membership interest in the U.S. LLCs in
    exchange for the real estate assets held by the Mexican limited
    liability entities covered under the Agreement. The
    U.S. LLCs in turn hold a 98.0 percent equity interest
    in the following Mexican limited liability entities (the
    “SRLs”): AMB Acción San Martín
    Obispo I, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB- Acción Centro
    Logístico Parque 1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción GDL
    1, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción San Martin Obispo
    II, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Corregidora Distribution
    Center, S. de R.L. de C.V. , AMB-Acción Apodaca Industrial
    Park 2, S. de R.L. de C.V., AMB-Acción Arbolada
    Distribution Center, S. de R.L. de C.V., and AMB-Acción Los
    Altos Industrial Park 1, S. de R.L. de C.V.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company owned 23 industrial
    buildings (the “Properties”), 12 in Guadalajara, 9 in
    Mexico City, 1 in Queretaro and 1 in Tijuana, totaling
    approximately 4.9 million square feet (unaudited).

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation.

These consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated
    financial statements include the financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows of the Company and the Company’s
    controlled subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests are reflected
    as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements. All significant intercompany amounts have
    been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and
    Transactions.

The U.S. dollar is the
    functional currency for the Company’s Mexican operations as
    it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which
    the Company operates. Monetary assets and liabilities
    denominated in Mexican pesos are remeasured using the exchange
    rate at

S-150


AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are
    reported at historical U.S. dollar balances. Income and
    expenses denominated in Mexican pesos are remeasured in a manner
    that approximates the weighted average exchange rates for the
    quarter. Foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains
    and losses are included in other income in the consolidated
    statement of operations. During the year ended December 31,
    2007, the Company reported foreign currency remeasurement and
    transaction losses of approximately $0.2 million.

Investments in Real Estate.

Investments in
    real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate
    that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to
    the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its
    estimated fair value.

Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the real
    estate investments. The estimated lives are as follows:

Building costs

5 to 40 years

Building and improvements:

Roof/HVAC/parking lots

5 to 40 years

Plumbing/signage

7 to 25 years

Painting and other

5 to 40 years

Tenant improvements

Over initial lease term

Lease commissions

Over initial lease term

The initial cost of buildings and improvements includes the
    purchase price of the property or interest in the property
    including legal fees and acquisition costs.

Project costs associated with the development and construction
    of a real estate project, which include interest and property
    taxes, are capitalized as construction in progress.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations as incurred. Significant renovations or improvements
    that extend the economic useful life of assets are capitalized.

The Company records at acquisition an intangible asset for the
    value attributable to in-place leases and lease origination
    costs. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has recorded
    intangible assets in the amounts of $6.2 million and
    $3.5 million, for the value attributable to in-place leases
    and lease origination costs, respectively, which are included in
    buildings and improvements in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet.

Real Estate Impairment Losses.

Carrying values
    for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on
    a

property-by-property

basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable.
    When the carrying value of a property is greater than its
    estimated fair value, based on the intended use and holding
    period, an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the
    excess over its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The
    intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the
    long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured.
    If an asset is intended to be held for the long term, the
    impairment analysis is based on a two-step test. The first test
    measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding
    period, including a residual value (undiscounted and without
    interest charges), against the carrying value of the property.
    If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is
    measured against the lower of cost or the present value of
    expected cash flows over the expected hold period. An impairment
    charge to earnings is recognized for the excess of the
    asset’s carrying value over the lower of cost or the
    present value of expected cash flows over the expected hold
    period. If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is
    determined using the estimated fair value less costs to sell.
    The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently
    uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future
    economic and market conditions and the availability of capital.
    The management of the Company determines estimated fair values
    based on its assumptions regarding rental rates,

lease-up

and
    holding periods, as well as sales prices. The management of the
    Company believes that there were no impairments of the carrying
    values of its investments in real estate as of December 31,
    2007.

AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and
    other highly liquid short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less.

Deferred Financing Costs.

Costs incurred in
    connection with financings are capitalized and amortized to
    interest expense using the effective-interest method over the
    term of the related loan. As of December 31, 2007, deferred
    financing costs were $1.8 million, net of accumulated
    amortization.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling
    interests represent interests held by AMB and G. Acción,
    S.A. de C.V. (“G. Acción”), a 38.9 percent
    owned entity of AMB, in various Company entities. Such
    investments are consolidated because the Company owns a majority
    interest and exercises control through the ability to control
    major operating decisions.

Members’ Capital.

Profits and losses of
    the Company are allocated to each of the members in accordance
    with the Agreement. Distributions are made to each of the
    members in accordance with the Agreement.

Rental Revenues.

The Company, as a lessor,
    retains substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership
    of the Properties and accounts for its leases as operating
    leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the terms of the leases. Reimbursements from tenants for
    real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are
    recognized as revenue in the period in which the applicable
    expenses are incurred. In addition, the Company nets its bad
    debt expense against rental income for financial reporting
    purposes. No bad debt expense was recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Income Taxes.

No provision for
    U.S. federal income taxes has been recorded on the books of
    the Company, since the members’ respective shares of
    taxable income are reportable by the members on their respective
    tax returns. The Company accounts for Mexican income taxes for
    its Mexican subsidiaries using the asset and liability method.
    Under this method, income and asset taxes are provided for
    amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred as tax assets
    and liabilities based on differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets
    and liabilities and the value of net operating loss
    carry-forward balances. Deferred income taxes are measured using
    the statutory tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when
    the temporary differences will reverse

and/or

the
    net operating loss carry-forward balances will be utilized. A
    valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to
    amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.

Concentration of Credit Risk.

There are owners
    and developers of real estate that compete with the Company in
    its trade areas. The existence of competing properties could
    have a material impact on the Company’s ability to lease
    space and on the level of rent that can be received. The Company
    has two tenants that accounted for 12.8 percent and
    10.2 percent, respectively, of rental revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Company’s financial instruments include mortgage loans
    payable and unsecured lines of credit. Based on borrowing rates
    available to the Company at December 31, 2007, the
    estimated fair value of the mortgage loans payable and lines of
    credit was $177.3 million. Management of the Company
    believes that the book value of its other financial instruments
    approximates fair value as of December 31, 2007.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In July 2006,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    issued a policy related to accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes, which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for
    uncertainty in tax positions. Adoption of this policy, on
    January 1, 2007, did not have a material impact on the
    Company.

In September 2006, the FASB issued a policy related to
    accounting for fair value measurements, which defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This policy
    is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe that the
    adoption of this policy will have a material impact on its
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

AMB-SGP

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In February 2007, the FASB issued a policy related to the
    accounting for the fair value option for financial assets and
    liabilities, which permits entities to choose to measure many
    financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that
    are not currently required to be measured at fair value and
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
    facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different
    measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
    liabilities. This policy is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007.
    The Company does not believe that the adoption of this policy
    will have a material impact on its financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

INCOME
    AND ASSET TAXES

As a U.S. limited liability company, the allocated share of
    income or loss of the Company is included in the income tax
    returns of the individual equity interest owners. The
    Company’s Mexican subsidiaries are subject to Mexican
    statutory income and asset tax laws.

During the third quarter 2007, new legislation was passed and
    effective January 1, 2008, the business flat tax (IETU)
    will replace the existing asset tax and function as an
    alternative minimum corporation tax.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company prepaid taxes to the
    Government of Mexico in the amount of $2.0 million, which
    is offset against current taxes payable in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.

The Company’s income tax provision was computed based on
    the 2007 Mexican statutory rate of 28.0 percent.

Mexican income and asset tax expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 were as follows:

(Dollars in thousands)

Current income and asset tax expense

$

(2,352

)

Deferred income tax expense

(377

)

Total expense for income taxes

$

(2,729

)

For tax purposes, as of December 31, 2007, the Company has
    Mexican net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
    $26.9 million, which will be available to offset future
    taxable income. If not used, this carry-forward will expire
    between 2012 and 2017.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
    used for income tax purposes. The Company’s deferred tax
    assets primarily relate to the value of tax net operating losses.

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating
    sufficient taxable income matching the reversal of prior
    years’ net operating losses giving rise to deferred tax
    assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2007, management
    believes that it is more likely than not that 100 percent
    of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

TRANSACTIONS
    WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTIES

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company records
    management/consulting fees to AMB and G. Acción at a rate
    of 7.35 percent and 0.15 percent, respectively, of the
    net operating income of each SRL. The management/consulting fees
    are payable on a quarterly basis. Management/consulting fees are
    included in general and administrative expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The Company
    recorded management/consulting fees to AMB and G. Acción of
    $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

In addition, the Agreement states that AMB and G. Acción
    will receive in aggregate acquisition fees equal to
    0.9 percent of the acquisition cost of any assets purchased
    by the Company other than assets purchased from an
    AMB-affiliated entity. The Company paid acquisition fees to AMB
    and G. Accion of $0.1 million and $0.5 million,
    respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007. These
    fees are capitalized and included in investments in real estate
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

AMB will be entitled to receive a promote distribution of
    15.0 percent of the return over a 9.0 percent nominal
    internal rate of return (“IRR”) and 20.0 percent
    over a 12.0 percent nominal IRR, reflecting the
    hypothetical dissolution of the Company at December 31,
    2011, or actual dissolution of the Company. As of
    December 31, 2007, no promote distribution had been earned
    by AMB.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had obligations to AMB
    and G. Acción of $2.8 million, primarily related to
    the unpaid portion of the purchase price of the properties
    acquired at the Date of Inception.

AMB-SGP
    MEXICO, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The SRLs are charged property management fees from G.
    Acción. The property management fees are calculated at a
    rate of 3.0 percent of net rental income as defined in the
    various SRL project agreements. Property management fees are
    included as part of property operating costs in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of operations. The Company incurred
    property management fees to G. Acción of $0.7 million
    for year ended December 31, 2007.

In December 2001, AMB formed a wholly-owned captive insurance
    company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides
    insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the
    deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance
    company is one element of AMB’s overall risk management
    program. AMB capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in
    accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on
    projections derived from the past loss experience of AMB’s
    properties. Annually, AMB engages an independent third party to
    perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
    related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund
    associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata
    National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate.
    Consistent with third-party policies, premiums may be reimbursed
    by customers subject to specific lease terms. Through this
    structure, AMB has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an
    overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the
    market. Unknown liabilities may include liabilities for

clean-up

or
    remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions, and accrued
    but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
    business.

The Properties are allocated a portion of the insurance expense
    incurred by AMB based on AMB’s assessment of the specific
    risks at those properties. Insurance expense allocated to the
    Properties amounted to approximately $0.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation.

In the normal course of business,
    from time to time, the Company may be involved in legal actions
    relating to the ownership and operations of its Properties.
    Management does not expect that the liabilities, if any, that
    may ultimately result from such legal actions will have a
    material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Environmental Matters.

The Company follows
    AMB’s policy of monitoring its properties for the presence
    of hazardous or toxic substances. The Company is not aware of
    any environmental liability with respect to the SRLs that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business
    assets or results of operations. However, there can be no
    assurance that such a material environmental liability does not
    exist. The existence of any such material environmental
    liability could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

General Uninsured Losses.

The Company carries
    liability, flood, environmental, terrorism and property and
    rental loss insurance. The Company believes that the policy
    terms and conditions, limits and deductibles are adequate and
    appropriate under the circumstances, given the relative risk of
    loss and the cost of such coverage and industry practice. In
    addition, certain of the Company’s properties are located
    in areas that are subject to earthquake activity; therefore, the
    Company has obtained limited earthquake insurance on those
    properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
    losses, such as those due to acts of wars that may be either
    uninsurable or not economically insurable. Although, the Company
    has obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy
    specifications and insured limits, that the Company believes are
    commercially reasonable, it is not certain that the Company will
    be able to collect under such policies. If an uninsured loss
    occurs, the Company could lose its investment in and anticipated
    profits and cash flows from, a property. AMB has adopted certain
    policies with respect to insurance coverage and proceeds as part
    of its operating policies which apply to properties owned or
    managed by AMB, including properties owned by the Company.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

10.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted policies
    related to accounting for noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity that should be reported as capital in
    the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the
    adoption, the Company has retroactively renamed the minority
    interests as noncontrolling interests and has reclassified these
    balances to the capital section of the consolidated balance
    sheet. In addition, on the consolidated statement of operations,
    the presentation of net loss retroactively includes the portion
    of income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
