DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

Portions of Part III of this report are incorporated by reference to the registrant’s definitive proxy statement for the 2016 annual meeting of its stockholders or will be provided in an amendment filed on Form 10-K/A.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, of Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Prologis, Inc.” or the “Parent” mean Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries; and references to “Prologis, L.P.” or the “Operating Partnership” mean Prologis, L.P., and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms “the Company,” “Prologis,” “we,” “our” or “us” means Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership collectively.

Prologis, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (a “REIT”) and the general partner of the Operating Partnership. At December 31, 2015, Prologis, Inc. owned an approximate 97.12% common general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and 100% of the preferred units in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximate 2.88% common limited partnership interests are owned by nonaffiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of Prologis, Inc. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Prologis, Inc. has complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Operating Partnership.

We operate Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management of Prologis, Inc. consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. These members are officers of Prologis, Inc. and employees of the Operating Partnership or one of its subsidiaries. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, Prologis, Inc. consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes. Because the only significant asset of Prologis, Inc. is its investment in the Operating Partnership, the assets and liabilities of Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.

We believe combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits:

·

enhances investors’ understanding of Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;

·

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation as a substantial portion of the Company’s disclosure applies to both Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership; and

·

creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

It is important to understand the few differences between Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate the Company. Prologis, Inc. does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing public equity from time to time. Prologis, Inc. itself does not incur any indebtedness, but it guarantees the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the business, directly or indirectly, and holds the ownership interests in the Company’s investment in certain entities. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by Prologis, Inc., which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates capital required by the business through the Operating Partnership’s operations, incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of partnership units to third parties.

Noncontrolling interests, stockholders’ equity and partners’ capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of Prologis, Inc. and those of the Operating Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership’s consolidated financial statements include the interests in consolidated entities not owned by the Operating Partnership. The noncontrolling interests in Prologis, Inc.’s consolidated financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level, as well as the common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, not owned by Prologis, Inc., which are accounted for as partners’ capital by the Operating Partnership.

To highlight the differences between Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, separate sections in this report, as applicable, individually discuss Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, including separate financial statements and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure of Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of Prologis.

Exhibits, Financial Statements and Schedules



The statements in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-lookin

g statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate as well as management’s beliefs and assumptions. Such statements involve uncertainties that could significantly impact our financia

l results. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” and “estimates” including variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, which generally are not histori

cal in nature. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to rent and occupancy growth, development activity and changes in sales or contri

bution volume of properties, disposition activity, general conditions in the geographic areas where we operate, our debt, capital structure and financial position, our ability to form new co-investment ventures and the availability of capital in existing o

r new co-investment ventures — are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Although we believe the expectations reflected

in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-loo

king statements. Some of the factors that may affect outcomes and results include, but are not limited to

: (i) national, international, regional and local economic climates, (ii) changes in financial markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange ra

tes, (iii) increased or unanticipated competition for our properties, (iv) risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions and development of properties, (v) maintenance of REIT status, tax structuring and income tax rates, (vi) availability of financing

and capital, the levels of debt that we maintain and our credit ratings, (vii) risks related to our investments in our co-investment ventures, including our ability to establish new co-investment ventures, (viii) risks of doing business internationally, in

cluding currency risks, (ix) environmental uncertainties, including risks of natural disasters, and (x) those additional factors discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements appearing i

n this report except as may be required by law.

PART I

ITEM 1. Business

The Company

We are the global leader in logistics real estate, focused on high-barrier, high-growth markets across the Americas, Europe and Asia. At December 31, 2015, we owned or had investments in, on a wholly owned basis or through co-investment ventures, properties and development projects expected to total approximately 669 million square feet (62 million square meters) in 20 countries. We lease modern distribution facilities to a diverse base of more than 5,200 customers across two major categories: business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment. For business-to-business enterprises, our buildings serve a variety of sectors, including automotive, transportation, pharmaceuticals and general consumer goods. In the area of retail/online fulfillment, our state-of-the-art logistics facilities foster the seamless flow of goods around the world.

Details of the 669 million square feet at December 31, 2015 was as follows (dollars and square feet in millions):

(1)

Total expected investment (“TEI”) represents total estimated cost of development or expansion, including land, development and leasing costs. TEI is based on current projections and is subject to change. Non-U.S. dollar investments are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at period end or the date of development start for purposes of calculating development starts in any period.

Our operating portfolio includes stabilized industrial properties in our owned and managed portfolio. A developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets stabilization. The property is considered stabilized when a development project has been completed for one year or is at least 90% occupied whichever occurs first. Our other real estate properties include properties in which we have an ownership interest but do not manage, and other properties we own, such as value-added


properties and assets held for sal

e to third parties. Value-added properties are those which are expected to be repurposed or redeveloped to a higher and better use. They also include newly acquired properties that present opportunities to create greater value.

Prologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Internal Revenue Code”). We believe the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. The Operating Partnership also was formed in 1997.

Our global corporate headquarters are at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111, and our other principal offices are in Amsterdam, Denver, Luxembourg, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo.

Our Internet address is

www.prologis.com

. All reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are available and can be accessed free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website after we electronically submit material to the SEC. The common stock of Prologis, Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker “PLD” and is a component of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500.

Investment Strategy

Our investment strategy focuses on providing high-quality distribution facilities to customers whose businesses are tied to consumption and global trade and as such depend on the efficient movement of goods through the supply chain. We have a significant worldwide presence of $51.5 billion of real estate assets in our owned and managed portfolio which spans 20 countries on four continents. We focus our investments in large population centers with high per-capita consumption rates located near major airports, seaports and rail and highway systems. We classify our properties into two main market categories: global and regional. Global markets comprise approximately 30 of the largest markets tied to global trade and consumption. Regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain; instead, they serve local consumption and are less supply constrained.

We intend to hold primarily Class-A product in global and regional markets. At December 31, 2015, global and regional markets represented approximately 89% and 11%, respectively, of our owned and managed portfolio (based on our share, as determined by our ownership percentage for consolidated and unconsolidated entities, of the properties’ gross book value).

We have deep knowledge of our local markets, extensive construction expertise and a demonstrated commitment to sustainable design across our portfolio. We are supported by a diverse customer base and our relationships with multinational corporations bring us repeat business across our global portfolio. See below for information on our customers. For more detail on our properties, see Item 2. Properties.

Both macroeconomics and demographics are important drivers of our business; these drivers include population growth, consumption and rising affluence. In the developed markets of the United States (or “U.S.”), Europe and Japan, the reconfiguration of supply chains, which is strongly influenced by e-commerce trends, as well as the operational efficiencies that can be realized from our modern logistics facilities, are key factors. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, new affluence and the rise of the consumer classes together have prompted demand as supply chains are constructed. Taken together, logistics real estate markets benefit from economic growth, as well as from the modernization of supply chains around the world.

In addition to our wholly owned investments we also have investments in a variety of ventures. We co-invest with partners and investors in entities that own multiple properties. We refer to these entities as co-investment ventures (consolidated or unconsolidated).

Business Strategy and Operating Segments

Our business comprises two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital.

Real Estate Operations

Rental Operations.

Rental operations is the largest segment and contributed approximately 90% of our revenues, earnings and funds from operations in 2015 (see below for our definition of funds from operations and a complete reconciliation to net earnings in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. We expect to generate long-term internal growth by maintaining high occupancy rates, controlling expenses and increasing rents. Our rental revenue is diversified by customer segment and geography. We believe our property management, leasing and maintenance teams, together with our capital expenditure, energy and risk management programs, create cost efficiencies that allow us to capitalize on the economies of scale inherent in owning, operating and growing a global portfolio.

Capital Deployment

. Capital deployment includes the development, redevelopment and acquisition of industrial properties to increase rental income and therefore is reported with rental operations. We primarily deploy capital in global and regional markets to serve our customers’ requirements. We capitalize on the following: (i) our land bank, (ii) the development expertise of our local teams, (iii) our customer relationships, and (iv) the demand for high-quality distribution facilities. We aim to increase our rental revenue and our net asset value by leasing newly developed space and acquiring operating properties. We develop properties for long-term hold, for contribution to our co-investment ventures and, occasionally, for sale to third parties. In 2015, we stabilized $1.6 billion of development projects with an estimated gross margin of 32%, creating $515 million in value for Prologis.

Strategic Capital

Real estate is a capital intensive business that requires growth capital. We manage third-party capital on behalf of the world’s largest institutional partners in order to grow our business, provide incremental revenues, and align our assets and liabilities in local currencies thereby mitigating foreign currency risk associated with our international investments. We tailor logistics portfolios to meet our partners’ specific needs, with a focus on long-term ventures and open-ended funds. We also access alternative sources of equity through the publicly traded vehicles Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. (“NPR”) and FIBRA Prologis. We hold a significant ownership interest in these ventures, aligning our interests with those of our partners. We generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated ventures through asset management and property management services and we earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development, financing and disposition services. At December 31, 2015, we managed 276.5 million square feet of operating properties in nine unconsolidated co-investment ventures. For more detail of our co-investment ventures, see Item 2. Properties. Depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners, we also earn revenues through incentive fees during the life of a venture or upon liquidation (called “promotes”). In 2015, this segment contributed approximately 10% of our revenues, earnings and our funds from operations. We plan to grow this business generally through our existing ventures.

Competition

Competitively priced distribution space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge, which in turn could affect both of our operating segments. We may face competition with regard to our capital deployment activities, including local, regional and national operators or developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business.


We believe we have competitive advantages due to our:

·

ability to respond quickly to customers’ needs for high-quality distribution space in key global and regional markets;

·

established relationships with key customers served by our local teams;

·

ability to leverage our organizational scale and structure to provide a single point of contact for global customers through the Prologis global customer solutions team;

·

property management and leasing expertise;

·

relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in our strategic capital business;

·

global experience developing and managing industrial properties;

·

well-positioned land bank; and

·

team members with experience in the land entitlement and development processes.

Customers

Our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international, national, regional and local distribution users. At December 31, 2015, in Real Estate Operations, we had more than 4,600 customers occupying 338.3 million square feet of distribution space. On an owned and managed basis, we had more than 5,200 customers occupying 614.7 million square feet of distribution space.

In Strategic Capital, we view our partners and investors as our customers. At December 31, 2015, in our private ventures, we partnered with approximately 100 investors, several of which invest in multiple ventures.

The following table details our top 25 customers at December 31, 2015 (square feet in thousands):

(1)

Net effective rent (or “NER”) is calculated using the estimated total cash to be received over the term of the lease (including base rent and expense reimbursements) divided by the lease term to determine the amount of rent and expense reimbursements received per year. Amounts derived in a currency other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average rate from the previous twelve months.


Employees

The following table summarizes our global employee base at December 31, 2015:

We believe we have good relationships with our employees. Prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, although some employees in Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and as such they benefit from applicable labor agreements.

Code of Ethics and Business Conduct

We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our board of directors (the “Board”) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website,

www.prologis.com

. In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, or the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website.

Environmental Matters

We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Insura

nce Coverage

We carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. The costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through reimbursements from our customers. We believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors

Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including but not limited to, our financial position, results of operations, cash flow, ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities. These risks relate to our consolidated company as well as our investments in unconsolidated entities and include among others, (i) general risks; (ii) risks related to our business; (iii) risks related to financing and capital and (iv) income tax risks.

General Risks

As a global company, we are subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in many countries.

We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the U.S. During 2015, we generated approximately $335.3 million or 15.3% of our revenue from operations outside the U.S. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include, but are not limited to, the following factors:

·

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations in certain regions, including differing employment practices and labor issues;

·

local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices;

·

volatility in currencies and currency restrictions, which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the U.S.;

·

challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different regions and to monitor compliance with applicable regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and other similar laws;

·

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tax and other laws;

·

potentially adverse tax consequences;

·

the responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, e.g., with respect to corrupt practices, employment and licensing;

·

the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;

·

political instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities;


·

foreign ownership restrictions in operations with the respective countries; and

·

access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations.

In addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries, including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt, due to currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other factors.

Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

To the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets, this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect (i) the value of our properties; (ii) the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing; (iii) our ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance any outstanding debt when due; and (iv) the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities.

Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, such as computer viruses or unauthorized access. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.

Risks associated with our dependence on key personnel.

We depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may change. While we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs, the loss of key personnel, any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected.

Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.

The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities.

The depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.

We pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency. At December 31, 2015, approximately $6.3 billion or 20.1% of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and, in particular, our U.S. dollar reported financial position and results of operations and debt covenant ratios. Although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts, there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful.

Our hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to other risks.

Hedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. The funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage. The failure to hedge effectively against exchange rate changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business.

Compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs.

We are required to comply with many regulations in different countries, including (but not limited to) the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and similar laws and regulations. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and state and local fire and life-safety requirements. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with these regulations we may be adversely affected.

Risks Related to our Business

Real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets, which may reduce economic returns to investors.

Real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions. Significant expenditures associated with real estate investments, such as secured mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments. As a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code, we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable REIT subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property. We may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity. If we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale, we may not pursue such sales.


We may decide to sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures or third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities. Our

ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by: (i) competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties; (ii) market conditions, including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties; and (i

ii) other factors beyond our control. If our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets, we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all

. The unconsolidated co-investment venture or third party who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital, in the private and public markets, in order to acquire properties from us. Should they have limited or no access

to capital on favorable terms, then dispositions could be delayed.

If we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations, sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting ourselves of properties, whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term, at less than optimal terms, incurring debt, entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates. There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us. Additionally, taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business, and in particular, our distributable cash flow and debt covenants.

Our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector.

Our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector. This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified.

General economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated, may impact financial results.

We are exposed to general economic conditions, local, regional, national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties. Our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties.

At December 31, 2015, approximately 31.9% of our consolidated operating properties or $7.7 billion (based on gross book value, or investment before depreciation) are located in California, which represented 25.1% of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 31.0% of our net operating income. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact California’s economic climate. Because of the number of properties we have located in California, a downturn in California’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our business.

In addition to California, we also have significant holdings (defined as more than 3.0% of total investment before depreciation) in operating properties in certain global and regional markets located in Atlanta, Central and Eastern Pennsylvania, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, New Jersey/New York City, and South Florida. Our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties. Conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space, among other factors, may impact operating conditions. Any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our overall business.

In addition, our owned and managed portfolio, including the unconsolidated co-investment ventures in which we invest, has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above, as well as in markets in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets.

A number of our investments, both wholly-owned and owned through co-investment ventures, are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. U.S. properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Seattle. International properties located in active seismic areas include Japan and Mexico. We generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self-insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis. We have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in Japan based on this analysis.

Furthermore, a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk. We carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants.

Investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business.

Investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk. While we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio, market research and our asset management capabilities, these risks cannot be eliminated. Factors that may affect real estate values include:

·

local conditions, such as a reduction in demand for distribution space in an area due to oversupply and obsolescence, such as changes in technology, may impact the supply chain for ourselves and our customers;

·

the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers and competition from other available properties;

·

increasing costs of maintaining, insuring, renovating and making improvements to our properties;

·

our ability to rehabilitate and reposition our properties due to changes in the business needs of our customers;

·

our ability to control rents and variable operating costs; and

·

governmental regulations and the associated potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, usage, tax and other laws.

We may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire.

Our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations. We are also subject to the risk that, upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties, leases may not be renewed by existing customers, the space may not be


re-leased to new c

ustomers or the terms of renewal or re-leasing (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers) may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or belo

w the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire. In the event of default by a si

gnificant number of customers, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord, and we may be unable to re-lease spaces. A customer may experience a downturn in its business, which may cause the loss of the customer

or may weaken its financial condition, resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease. In addition, a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency

or similar laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow.

We may acquire properties, which involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

We have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties, both through the direct acquisition of real estate and through the acquisition of entities that own the real estate and through additional investments in co-investment ventures that acquire properties. The acquisition of properties involves risks, including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements identified in the pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates. When we acquire properties, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. Additionally, there is, and it is expected there will continue to be, significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities. The acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities, which may be without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based on ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it.

Our real estate development strategies may not be successful.

Our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through sales to third parties, development of industrial properties to hold for long-term investment or contribution or sale to a co-investment venture or third party, depending on market conditions, our liquidity needs and other factors. We may increase our investment in the development, renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the build-out and leasing of our current development portfolio. We may also develop, renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed co-investment ventures. The real estate development, renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks:

·

we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all;

·

we may explore development opportunities that may be abandoned and the related investment impaired;

·

we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations;

·

we may have construction costs, total investment amounts and our share of remaining funding that exceed our estimates and projects may not be completed, delivered or stabilized as planned due to defects or other issues;

·

we may not be able to attract third-party investment in new development co-investment ventures or sufficient customer demand for our product;

·

we may have properties that perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts;

·

we may seek to sell certain land parcels and not be able to find a third party to acquire such land or the sales price will not allow us to recover our investment, resulting in impairment charges;

·

we may not be able to lease properties we develop on favorable terms or at all;

·

we may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced value created by our value-added properties on expected timetables or at all;

·

we may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if there is public or government opposition to our activities; and

·

we may have substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment activities, regardless of their ultimate success, that require a significant amount of management’s time and attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day operations.

We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming co-investment ventures, investing in new or existing co-investment ventures, attracting third-party investment and investing in and managing properties through co-investment ventures.

At December 31, 2015, we had investments in real estate containing approximately 393 million square feet held through co-investment ventures, both public and private. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures, and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through co-investment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new co-investment ventures, or attract third-party investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful. Further, there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from such investments.

Our co-investment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face, including:

·

our partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions made on behalf of the ventures;

·

if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions, then we may choose to contribute such capital;

·

our partners might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the property;

·

the venture or other governing agreements often restrict the transfer of an interest in the co-investment venture or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms;


·

our relationships with our partners are g

enerally contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event, we may not continue to manage or invest in the assets underlying such relationships resulting in reduced fee revenue or causing a need t

o purchase such interest to continue ownership; and

·

disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable co-investment venture to additional risk.

We generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our co-investment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives; however, we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely. We have formed publicly traded investment vehicles, such as NPR and FIBRA Prologis, for which we serve as sponsor or manager. We have contributed, and may continue to contribute, assets into such vehicles. There is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated.

We are exposed to various environmental risks, including the potential impacts of future climate change, which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition.

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner, developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination.

Environmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties are known to contain asbestos-containing building materials.

In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.

We are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Our distribution facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. We do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change, as our operations generally do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. However, we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings. We cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future. The presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral, and this may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, and in particular, our distributable cash flow.

Our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses.

We and our unconsolidated co-investment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance, as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties, business activities and markets. We believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures are adequately insured. Certain losses, however, including losses from floods, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots, generally are not insured against or generally are not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property.

Furthermore, we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business.

Risks Related to Financing and Capital

We may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments.

We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness, that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness, or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and, if the maturing debt is secured, the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness. Our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements.

Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition.

The terms of our various credit agreements, including our credit facilities, the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements, require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios, fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness. If we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default, refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations, our business and financial condition generally and, in particular, the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected.


Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity.

The credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity.

At December 31, 2015, our credit ratings were Baa1 from Moody’s and BBB+ from S&P, both with outlook stable. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.

We depend on external sources of capital.

To qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed. Historically, we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, our own stock. For distributions with respect to taxable years that ended on or before December 31, 2015, and in some cases declared as late as December 31, 2016, a REIT can satisfy up to 90% of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on third-party sources of capital. Furthermore, to maintain our REIT status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities.

Our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the Operating Partnership.

Any additional future issuance of common stock or operating partnership units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors. In most circumstances, stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units. In addition, depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or units and the value of the properties, our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units.

Income Tax Risks

The failure of Prologis, Inc. to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences.

Prologis, Inc. elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We believe we have operated Prologis, Inc. to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable Prologis, Inc. to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow Prologis, Inc. to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause Prologis, Inc. to fail to qualify. Qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some annually and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, to qualify as a REIT, Prologis, Inc. must derive at least 95% of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, Prologis, Inc. must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations regarding qualification as a REIT are more complicated for Prologis, Inc. because we hold assets through the Operating Partnership.

If Prologis, Inc. fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, Prologis, Inc. would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification. If Prologis, Inc. lost its REIT status, our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved.

Furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary REITs that elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. Provided that each subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interest in such subsidiary REIT will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. To qualify as a REIT, the subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements. If such subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions did not apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax. In addition, a failure of the subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT would have an adverse effect on the ability of Prologis, Inc. to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus its ability to qualify as a REIT.

Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction.

From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including by contributing properties to our co-investment ventures. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. We do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue Code were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT.


Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us.

In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the U.S. and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate, REITs, similar entities and investments. Additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future, both in and outside of the U.S. and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders.

ITEM 2. Properties

Geographic Distribution

We are invested in real estate properties that are predominately industrial properties. Our properties are typically used for distribution, storage, packaging, assembly and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products. The vast majority of our operating properties are used by our customers for bulk distribution.

We manage our business on an owned and managed basis whether a property is wholly owned by us or owned by one of our co-investment ventures. We believe that the operating fundamentals of our owned and managed portfolio are consistent with those of our consolidated portfolio and therefore allow us to make business decisions based on the property operations versus our ownership. As such, we have included operating property information for Real Estate Operations and our owned and managed portfolio. The owned and managed portfolio includes the properties we consolidate and the properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures reflected at 100% of the ventures, not our proportionate share.

Included in Real Estate Operations are 628 buildings owned primarily by two co-investment ventures that we consolidate but of which we own less than 100% of the equity. No individual property or group of properties operating as a single business unit amounted to 10% or more of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2015, or generated income equal to 10% or more of our consolidated gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015.


Dollars and square feet in the following tables are in thousands:

Certain of our consolidated properties are pledged as security under secured mortgage debt and assessment bonds at December 31, 2015. For purposes of this table, the total principal balance of a debt issuance that is secured by a pool of properties is allocated among the properties in the pool based on each property’s investment balance. In addition to the amounts reflected here, we also have $76.2 million of encumbrances related to other real estate properties not included in Real Estate Operations. See Schedule III

We have a 50% ownerships interest in and consolidate an entity that in turn owns 50% of several entities that we account for on the equity method. Also, we have additional investments in other unconsolidated entities in Brazil that we account for on the equity method with various ownership interests ranging from 5 to 50%.

For more information regarding our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we and our unconsolidated co-investment ventures are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that, with respect to any such matters to which we are currently a party, the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 6. Selected

Financial Data

The following table summarizes selected financial data related to our historical financial condition and results of operations for both Prologis, Inc. and the Operating Partnership (in millions, except for per share and unit amounts):

(1)

In 2011, AMB Property Corporation (“AMB”) completed a merger (the “Merger”) with ProLogis, a Maryland REIT (“ProLogis”). In the Merger, AMB was the legal acquirer and ProLogis was the accounting acquirer. Following the Merger, AMB changed its name to Prologis, Inc. In 2011, we also completed an acquisition of one of our unconsolidated ventures in Europe. Activity in 2011 included five months of results of ProLogis, as it was the accounting acquirer in the Merger and seven months of results of the combined company resulting from the Merger and the acquisition in Europe.

(2)

For 2015, 2014 and 2013, the amounts for the Operating Partnership were the same as Prologis, Inc. Net earnings (loss) attributable to common unitholders for the Operating Partnership was $(0.34) and $0.16 for continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively, in 2012, and was $(0.82) and $0.31 for continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively, in 2011.

(3)

In 2014, the accounting standard changed for classifying and reporting discontinued operations and as such, none of our dispositions in 2015 or 2014 met the qualifications to be reported as discontinued operations.

(4)

In 2015, we early adopted an accounting standard that required the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet to be shown as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than as a deferred charge included in assets and we began presenting debt issuance costs in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. At December 31, 2015, we have $52.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs included in

Debt

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This adoption resulted in the reclassification of $43.2 million, $37.7 million, $42.4 million and $47.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

FFO; FFO, as defined by Prologis and Core FFO are not determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and are measures commonly used in the real estate industry. See below for our definition of FFO and a complete reconciliation to net earnings in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report and the matters described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Management’s Overview

We believe the scale and quality of our operating platform, the skills of our team and the strength of our balance sheet gives us unique competitive advantages. Our plan to grow revenue, earnings, net operating income (“NOI”), cash flows and Core FFO (see below for definition of Core FFO and a complete reconciliation to net earnings) is based on the following:

·

Rising Rents.

Market rents are increasing across many of our markets. We expect rent growth to continue as demand for logistics facilities is strong in many markets across the globe. Because many of our leases originated during low rent periods following the global financial crisis, in-place leases have room for growth, which translates into increased earnings, NOI and cash flow both on a consolidated basis and through the amounts we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership share. We had positive rent change on rollovers (when comparing the net effective rent of the new lease to the prior lease for the same space) on our owned and managed operating portfolio every quarter for the last three years. We had quarterly increases from 9.5% to 14.4% during 2015.


·

Value Creation from Development.

We believe a successful development program involves maintaining control of

well-positioned land. On the basis of our current estimates, our owned and managed land bank has the potential to support the development of more than 154 million additional square feet of industrial space. We believe the carrying value of our land bank is

below its current fair value, and we expect to realize this value going forward through development of our strategic land and dispositions of nonstrategic land

. During 2015, in our owned and managed portfolio, we stabilized development projects with a TEI

of $1.8 billion. Post stabilization, we estimate the value of these buildings will be approximately 32% more than their book value or the cost to develop (defined as estimated margin and calculated using estimated yield and capitalization rates from our u

nderwriting models).

·

Economies of Scale from Growth in Assets Under Management.

We believe we have the infrastructure that will allow us to increase our investments in real estate, with minimal increases to general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses. During 2015, our owned and managed real estate assets increased through the acquisition of 73.7 million square feet of operating properties, principally through the acquisition of the real estate portfolio of KTR Capital Partners and its affiliates (“KTR”). We completed and integrated this acquisition with minimal increases in gross overhead that were related to property management functions.

Summary of 2015

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed the following activities as further described in the Consolidated Financial Statements:

·

In May, we acquired the real estate assets and operating platform of KTR. The portfolio consisted of 315 operating properties aggregating 59 million square feet, 3.6 million square feet of properties under development and land parcels that will support an estimated build out of 6.8 million square feet. The total assets were valued at $5.8 billion. The properties were acquired by our consolidated co-investment venture Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture (“USLV”), of which we own 55%. The acquisition was funded through cash, the assumption of debt and the issuance of 4.5 million common limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership.

·

In connection with an acquisition of a portfolio of properties in October, we issued 9.1 million units in the Operating Partnership, which included 8.9 million units of a new class of common limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership designated as Class A convertible common limited partnership units (“Class A Units”) in connection with an acquisition, for a total value of $371.6 million.

·

We issued $1.5 billion in senior notes, entered into $1.8 billion unsecured senior term loans and repurchased and tendered several series of senior notes for $0.7 billion. See further discussion on these transactions and other debt activity in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below.

·

We generated net proceeds of $3.2 billion and net gains of $758.9 million from the contribution and disposition of real estate investments. The gains were driven by dispositions to third parties of $609.9 million, primarily in the United States, and property contributions of $149.0 million, primarily in Europe.

·

In March, the holders of the exchangeable notes exchanged $459.8 million of their notes for 11.9 million shares of common stock of the Parent and $0.2 million of their notes for cash.

We had significant development activity and strong operating metrics in 2015. See below, in Our Owned and Managed Portfolio section, for details of our development and operating activity.

Results of Operations

Real Estate Operations

This operating segment includes rental revenue and rental expense recognized from our consolidated operating properties. We had significant real estate activity during 2015 and 2014 that impacted the size of our consolidated portfolio. The 2015 results include approximately seven months of NOI from the properties acquired in the KTR acquisition (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on this transaction). The operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate have been improving, which has positively affected both the occupancy and rental rates we have experienced and also has fueled development activity. This operating segment also includes revenue from land we own and lease to customers and development management and other revenue, net of acquisition, disposition and land holding costs.

Real Estate Operations NOI for the years ended December 31 was as follows (dollars in millions):

Detail of our consolidated operating properties for the years ended December 31 was as follows (square feet in millions):


The following were the key drivers of Real Estate Operations NOI:

·

Capital deployment activity within the portfolio, which included acquisitions, development stabilizations, contributions to co-investment ventures and dispositions to third parties, affected NOI as follows:

2015 as compared with 2014

(

$236.9 million net increase)

o

KTR acquisition during the second quarter of 2015:

§

$175.7 million increase from property operations,

§

$24.7 million decrease from acquisition costs associated with the transaction,

§

approximately 45% of all KTR activity is offset in

Less

Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

in the Consolidated Statements of Income attributable to our venture partner’s share;

o

consolidation of Prologis North American Industrial Fund (“NAIF”) during the fourth quarter of 2014: $153.1 million increase; of which approximately 34% of all activity is offset in

Less Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

;

o

other acquisitions and development activity: $53.3 million increase;

o

contribution activity: $56.4 million decrease;

o

disposition activity: $41.8 million decrease; and

o

$22.3 million decrease from increased acquisition costs, excluding KTR.

2014 as compared with 2013 ($63.7 million net decrease)

o

acquisitions and development activity: $84.8 million increase;

o

consolidation of NAIF: $35.8 million increase;

o

contribution activity: $140.3 million decrease; and

o

disposition activity: $44.0 million decrease.

·

NOI increased due to an increase in average occupancy in our operating properties of 80 basis points in 2015 from 2014 and 90 basis points in 2014 from 2013. The KTR properties were 89.2% occupied at the time of the acquisition, which decreased our average and period-end occupancy slightly.

·

We leased a total of 94.7 million square feet, or 29.7% of our average portfolio; 72.9 million square feet, or 27.5% of our average portfolio and 87.6 million square feet, or 32.1% of our average portfolio; during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

·

We recognize changes in rental revenue from contractual rent increases on existing leases. We recognize the total rental revenue under the lease on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease which includes all known contractual changes. If a lease has a contractual rent increase that is not known at the time the lease is signed, such as the consumer price index or a similar metric, the rent increase is not included in rent leveling; therefore, any rent increase will impact the rental revenue we recognize.

·

We experienced an increase in rental rates on the turnover of existing leases every quarter since 2012 that has resulted in higher average rental rates in our portfolio and increased rental revenue and NOI as those leases commenced.

·

Under the terms of our lease agreements, we are able to recover the majority of our rental expenses from customers. Rental expense recoveries, included in both rental revenue and rental expenses, were 80.5%, 81.0% and 73.4% of total rental expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

·

We adopted a new accounting standard, effective January 1, 2014, that changed the criteria for classifying and reporting discontinued operations. The results of the third-party dispositions remained in continuing operations in 2015 and 2014, whereas in 2013, the results were reclassified to discontinued operations and not included in Real Estate Operations.

Strategic Capital

This operating segment includes revenue from fees and promotes earned for services performed for our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. This revenue is reduced generally by the direct costs associated with the asset management of these ventures and allocated property-level management costs for the properties owned by the ventures. Revenue associated with the Strategic Capital segment fluctuates because of the size of co-investment ventures under management, the transactional activity in the venture and the timing of promotes.


Strategic Capital NOI for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in millions):

(1)

Strategic Capital expenses for the Americas include employees who are employed in an office in the Americas who may also support other regions.

The following assets under management were held through our unconsolidated co-investment ventures at December 31 (dollars and square feet in millions):

The following were the key drivers of Strategic Capital NOI:

·

We contributed 31, 126 and 254 properties to several co-investment ventures during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

·

The unconsolidated co-investment ventures acquired 43, 81 and 57 properties from third parties during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

·

In December 2015, we earned two promotes aggregating $56.6 million, principally from our co-investment venture Prologis European Logistics Partners

Sàrl

(“PELP”). Of that amount, $29.5 million represented the third-party investors’ portion and is reflected in

Strategic Capital Revenue

in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

·

In June 2014, we earned a promote of $42.1 million from our co-investment venture Prologis Targeted U.S. Logistics Fund (“USLF”). Of that amount, $31.3 million represented the third-party investors’ portion and is reflected in

Strategic Capital Revenue

.

·

We acquired a controlling interest in our co-investment venture NAIF in the fourth quarter of 2014 and began consolidating the venture.

·

We formed the co-investment venture FIBRA Prologis in Mexico in June 2014, and in connection with this transaction, we concluded the Prologis Mexico Industrial Fund.

·

The amounts presented for Europe and Asia are shown in U.S. dollars and were impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily the euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen to U.S. dollar. We have hedged the majority of our investment in euro, British pound sterling, and Japanese yen through outstanding debt and derivative instruments that offset the majority of these fluctuations.

The direct costs associated with Strategic Capital totaled $88.4 million, $96.5 million and $89.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in the line item

Strategic Capital Expenses

in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fluctuations in

Strategic Capital Expenses

were due to the timing of promotes and the payment of the related bonus pursuant to the terms of the Prologis Promote Plan and due to the size of our co-investment ventures.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.


Our

Owned and Managed Properties

We manage our business on an owned and managed basis including properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our co-investment ventures. As further discussed, we believe that the operating fundamentals of our owned and managed portfolio are consistent with those of our consolidated portfolio. The activity in our owned and managed portfolio affects both our Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital segments, as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership share.

Our owned and managed properties includes operating industrial properties and does not include properties under development or held for sale to third parties and was as follows at December 31 (square feet in millions):

Operating Activity

The following table summarizes our operating activity for the years ended December 31 (square feet in millions):

Average turnover costs per square foot have increased in 2015, however the turnover costs as a percentage of the total value of the lease is in line or lower than previous periods. The total value of the leases signed have increased due to higher rents on rollover.

Retention is the square footage of all leases renewed by existing tenants divided by the square footage of all expiring and renewed leases during the reporting period, excluding the square footage of tenants that default or buy-out prior to expiration of their lease and the square footage of short-term leases.

Development Starts and Stabilization Activity

The following table summarizes development starts for the years ended December 31 (dollars and square feet in millions):

(1)

We expect these developments to be completed before July 2017.

The following table summarizes development stabilization activity for the years ended December 31 (dollars and square feet in millions):

For information on our development portfolio at December 31, 2015, see Item 2. Properties.

Same Store Analysis

We evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures. We include properties from our consolidated portfolio, as well as properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures that we manage in our same store analysis. We have defined the same store portfolio, for each quarter in 2015, as those properties that were in operation at January 1, 2014, and have been in operation throughout the same three-month periods in both 2015 and 2014. We have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale to a third party from the population for both periods. We believe the factors that affect rental revenue, rental expenses and NOI in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total portfolio. To derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the recent period end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the U.S. dollar, for both periods.


We calculate our same store results on a quarterly basis and provide a reconciliation of those results to the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table summarizes same store NOI and the change from prior period for the four quarters of 2015

and on a cumulative annual basis and the square feet of the portfolio used in the calculation (dollars and square feet in millions):

(1)

A reconciliation of our same store results for these fiscal quarters to the Consolidated Statements of Income is provided in our previously filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the respective quarter.

The following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenue, rental expenses and NOI (calculated as rental revenue and recoveries less rental expenses) for the full year, as included in the Consolidated Statements of Income, to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended December 31 (dollars in millions):

(1)

As discussed, our same store portfolio includes industrial properties from our consolidated portfolio and owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures that are managed by us. We include 100% of the NOI from the properties in our same store portfolio. During the periods presented, certain properties owned by us were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. Neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the unconsolidated entities subsequent to the contribution date).

(2)

We exclude the net termination and renegotiation fees from our same store rental revenue to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property’s rental revenue without regard to items that are not indicative of the property’s recurring operating performance. Net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. The adjustments to remove these items are included in “effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other” in this table.


(3)

Rental expenses include the direct operating expenses of the property such as property taxes, insurance and utilities. In addition, we include an allocation of the property management expenses for our direct-owned properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). On consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expenses. These expenses fluctuate based on the level of properties included in the same store portfolio and any adjustment is included as “effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other” in this table.

Other Components of Income (Expense)

G&A Expenses

The following table summarizes G&A expenses for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

Gross overhead includes all costs related to our business, including those attributable to the Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital segments. We allocate a portion of our gross overhead that relates to property management functions to both segments based on the size of the respective portfolios. Costs directly associated with Strategic Capital also are allocated to that segment. The decrease in gross overhead from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen. The increase in gross overhead from 2013 to 2014 was principally due to increased compensation.

We capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities. Capitalized G&A expenses included salaries and related costs, as well as other G&A costs. The following table summarizes capitalized G&A costs for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses were $880.4 million, $642.5 million and $648.7 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses from 2014 to 2015 principally resulted from an increased investment in real estate properties from the KTR acquisition in May 2015, the consolidation of NAIF in the fourth quarter of 2014, other acquired properties and completed developments. This is offset slightly by the disposition of properties. The decrease from 2013 to 2014 was principally a result of the disposition and contribution of properties, offset slightly by additional depreciation and amortization from completed development, acquired properties and the consolidation of NAIF in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Earnings from Unconsolidated Entities, Net

We recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities that are accounted for under the equity method of $159.3 million, $134.3 million and $97.2 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The earnings we recognize are impacted by: (i) variances in revenues and expenses of each venture; (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture; (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties, when applicable; (iv) our ownership interest in each venture; and (v) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to U.S. dollars, if applicable. See the discussion of our co-investment ventures above in the Strategic Capital segment discussion and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.

Interest Expense

Gross interest expense increased in 2015, compared with 2014, due to higher debt driven by the KTR acquisition offset somewhat by a decrease in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2015 and 2014, we issued new debt with lower borrowing costs and used the proceeds to invest in real estate and pay down or buy back our higher cost debt. Gross interest expense decreased in 2014, compared with 2013, due to lower average debt levels and decreased interest rates. Our weighted average effective interest rate was 3.3%, 4.2% and 4.7% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further breakdown of gross interest expense, amortization and capitalized amounts included in net interest expense. See also the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs.

Gains on Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate and Revaluation of Equity Investments upon Acquisition of a Controlling Interest, Net

We recognized gains of $758.9 million, $725.8 million and $597.7 million in continuing operations during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, the gains were driven primarily from dispositions to third parties in the U.S. In 2014, the gains were driven from third party dispositions mainly in the U.S., gains from the revaluation of our equity investment in NAIF upon acquisition of a controlling interest and contributions to our co-investment ventures in Mexico. In 2013, the gains were driven primarily from contributions to our co-investment ventures in Europe. We expect to continue to have contributions to co-investment ventures in the future, primarily in Europe, Japan and Mexico, as well as make dispositions of properties to third parties, primarily in the U.S., all depending on market conditions and other factors. We expect to use the proceeds from such contributions and dispositions to pay down the remaining balance of $400.0 million on the term loan that was used to finance a portion of the KTR acquisition and to fund our capital deployment activities in 2016. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the gains we recognized.


Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses) and Related Amortization, Net

To mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure, we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate. However, we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany or third-party debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional currency. When the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity, a gain or loss may result. To a lesser degree, we also have transactions with third parties of certain assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the entities’ functional currency. Certain of our third-party and intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in

Foreign Currency Translation Losses, Net

in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. This treatment is applicable to third-party debt that is designated as a hedge of our net investment and intercompany debt that is deemed to be long-term in nature.

If the third-party debt is not designated as a hedge or the intercompany debt is deemed short-term in nature, we recognize a gain or loss in earnings when the debt is remeasured. We also recognized the change in fair value of derivative transactions not designated as hedges. To a lesser degree, we also have transactions with third parties of certain assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the entities’ functional currency.

The following table details our foreign currency and derivative gains (losses) and related amortization, net for the year ended December 31 (in millions):

(1)

See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our derivative transactions.

(2)

These gains or losses were primarily related to the remeasurement of short-term intercompany loans between the U.S. parent and certain consolidated subsidiaries in Europe and Japan and result from fluctuations in the exchange rates of the U.S. dollar to the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen.

(3)

The embedded derivative instrument (exchange feature) was related to our exchangeable senior notes that matured March 15, 2015. There will be no impact to the financial statements going forward. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the embedded derivative instrument related to our exchangeable senior notes.

Losses on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net

We repurchased portions of several series of senior notes, senior exchangeable notes and secured mortgage debt, which resulted in the recognition of losses of $86.3 million, $165.3 million and $277.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As a result of these transactions, we have reduced our effective interest rate and lengthened the maturities of our debt. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our debt repurchase.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

We recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable REIT subsidiaries, state and local income taxes and taxes incurred in our foreign jurisdictions. Our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries operating in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions.

The following table summarizes our income tax expense (benefit) for the year ended December 31 (in millions):

Our income taxes are discussed in more detail in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Discontinued Operations

As discussed above, we adopted a new accounting standard regarding discontinued operations effective January 1, 2014, and none of our property dispositions in 2015 or 2014 met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. In 2013, earnings from discontinued operations were $123.5 million. Discontinued operations under the previous standard represent the results of operations of properties that were sold to third parties along with the related gain on sale.

Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

This amount represents the third-party investors’ share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100% of the equity, reduced by the third party share of fees or promotes payable to us. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for Prologis, Inc. of $56.1 million, $103.1 million and $10.1 million, respectively. In 2015, this is primarily related to operating activity in our consolidated co-investment ventures, NAIF and USLV. USLV completed the KTR acquisition in May 2015, so approximately seven months of the operating activity were included, offset by third-party share of acquisition costs and an acquisition fee payable to us. We acquired a controlling interest in NAIF in the fourth quarter of 2014 and began consolidating the venture. In 2014, we recognized net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in Prologis Mexico Fondo Logistico (“AFORES”) of $64.8 million because of the FIBRA


Prologis transaction, primarily related to

the third-party investors’ share of the gain on disposition and the net deferred income tax benefit. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our consolidated co-investment ventures.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – Foreign Currency Translation Losses, Net

We recognize unrealized gains or losses related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars, along with realized and unrealized gains or losses associated with the changes in the fair value of derivative and nonderivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded net losses of $208.9 million, $171.4 million and $234.7 million, respectively. During 2015 and 2014, the unrealized losses were principally due to the weakening of the euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen and Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar from the beginning of the period to the end of the period. In 2013, the unrealized losses included approximately $190.0 million of foreign currency translation losses on the properties contributed to PELP and NPR due to the weakening of the euro and Japanese yen, respectively, to the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2012, through the date of the contributions. Also in 2013, we recorded unrealized losses due to the weakening of the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar, from the beginning of the period to the end of the period. See Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.

Environmental Matters

A majority of the properties we acquired were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 17 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about environmental liabilities.

We consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements.

Near-Term Principal Cash Sources and Uses

In addition to dividends to the common and preferred stockholders of Prologis and distributions to the holders of limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership and our partners in the consolidated co-investment ventures, we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following:

·

repayment of the balance on an unsecured senior term loan of $400.0 million that is scheduled to mature in 2016, however we are able to extend the maturity date by one year subject to certain conditions, if we so choose;

·

repayment of other debt and scheduled principal payments of $534.0 million in 2016;

·

completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio (at December 31, 2015, 91 properties in our development portfolio were 39.3% leased with a current investment of $1.9 billion and a TEI of $2.9 billion when completed and leased, leaving $1.0 billion remaining to fund);

·

development of new properties for long-term investment, including the acquisition of land in certain markets;

·

capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio;

·

additional investments in current unconsolidated entities or new investments in future unconsolidated co-investment ventures;

·

acquisition of operating properties or portfolios of operating properties in global or regional markets (depending on market and other conditions) for direct, long-term investment in our consolidated portfolio (this might include acquisitions from our co-investment ventures); and

·

repurchase of our outstanding debt or equity securities (depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors) through cash purchases, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise.

We expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources, all subject to market conditions:

·

available unrestricted cash balances ($264.1 million at December 31, 2015);

·

property operations;

·

fees earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures, including promotes;

·

distributions received from the co-investment ventures;

·

proceeds from the disposition of properties, land parcels or other investments to third parties;

·

proceeds from the contributions of properties to current or future co-investment ventures;

·

proceeds from the sale of a portion of our investments in co-investment ventures (in December 2015, we submitted redemption requests for a portion of our investment in Prologis Targeted European Logistics Fund (“PTELF”) and USLF for €185.0 million ($201.4 million at December 31, 2015) and $200.0 million, respectively, which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2016 and bring our ownership percentages more in-line with our long-term targeted ownership;


·

borrowing capacity under our current credit facility arra

ngements discussed in the following section ($2.6 billion available at December 31, 2015), other facilities or borrowing arrangements; and

·

proceeds from the issuance of debt securities, including secured mortgage debt.

We may also generate proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, subject to market conditions.

Debt

The following table summarizes information about our debt at December 31 (in millions):

As discussed earlier and in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed the KTR acquisition on May 29, 2015. To fund our share of the cash portion, approximately $2.6 billion, as well as our other net cash requirements, we borrowed $440.2 million under our credit facilities and entered into the following debt arrangements during the second quarter of 2015:

·

issued €700 million ($785.5 million) of senior notes with an interest rate of 1.4%, maturing in 2021;

·

entered into an unsecured senior term loan that matures in 2016 under which we originally drew $1.0 billion and has an outstanding balance of $400.0 million at December 31, 2015; and

·

entered into an unsecured senior term loan under which we can draw in Japanese yen in an aggregate amount not to exceed ¥65.0 billion that matures in 2022 (balance drawn was ¥65.0 billion ($539.9 million) at December 31, 2015).

We expect to repay the $400.0 million remaining balance on the senior term loan that was used to fund the KTR acquisition with proceeds generated from the contributions of certain development properties to our co-investment ventures in Europe, Japan and Mexico and proceeds generated from the disposition of certain nonstrategic properties to third parties.

In October 2015, we issued $750.0 million in principal amount of senior notes with an interest rate of 3.8% maturing in 2025. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repurchase approximately $512 million of our senior unsecured notes, including fees, with an average interest rate of 5.6% maturing in 2017 and 2018. We also commenced a tender offer through which we utilized a portion of the net proceeds to repurchase a portion of our senior notes that mature in 2019 and 2020 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $289 million, including fees and accrued interest, which had an average interest rate of 7.0%. A portion of the remaining proceeds was used for other corporate purposes, including other debt repayment and repurchases.

In December 2015, we entered into an unsecured senior term loan under which we can draw in Canadian dollars in an aggregate amount not to exceed CAD $371.9 million ($267.9 million at December 31, 2015) that matures in 2023 (which was fully drawn at December 31, 2015). We used the proceeds to pay down our credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.

At December 31, 2015, we had credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $2.6 billion, all of which was available for borrowing.

At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. These covenants include customary financial covenants for total debt, encumbered debt and fixed charge coverage ratios. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our debt.

Equity Commitments Related to Certain Co-Investment Ventures

Certain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. Our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. We may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash. For more information on equity commitments for our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have one consolidated co-investment venture, the Brazil Fund, with equity commitments at December 31, 2015, of $44.8 million, of which $22.4 million is our share and expires in December 2017. The equity commitments are denominated in Brazilian real and called and reported in U.S. dollars.

Cash Flow Summary

The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

In 2015 and 2014, cash provided by operating activities was more than the cash dividends paid on common and preferred stock by $158.7 million and $32.3 million, respectively. In 2013, cash provided by operating activities was less than the cash dividends paid on common and preferred stock by $88.9 million. In 2013, we had other sources of cash that we used, including proceeds from dispositions to third parties and contributions of real estate properties ($5.4 billion) and distributions from our co-investment ventures classified for a return of investment for reporting purposes ($411.9 million) both of which are included in investing activities. We used some of this cash to fund dividends not covered by cash provided by operating activities. As disclosed in Note 9 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we paid combined amounts for interest and income taxes of $370.0 million, $363.8 million and $526.0 million, respectively, in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In addition, our cash provided by operating activities, exclusive of changes in receivables and payables, is impacted by the following significant activity:


·

Real estate operations NOI

.

We receive the majority of our operating cash through our Real Estate Operations segment. NOI from this segment, less the noncash amount of straight-lined rent and amortization of above and below market leases, was $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See our Results of Operations section above for the key drivers of our real estate operations NOI.

·

Strategic capital NOI.

We also generate operating cash through our Strategic Capital segment by providing management services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. NOI from this segment was $121.9 million, $123.4 million and $90.2 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See our Results of Operations section above for the key drivers of our strategic capital NOI. Included in the NOI for 2015 is net promote income of $24.8 million that was earned as of December 31, 2015 but will be paid in the first quarter of 2016 and will be included in cash provided by operating activities at that time.

Distributions from unconsolidated entities.

We received $144.0 million, $117.9 million and $68.3 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of distributions from our unconsolidated entities as a return on our investment and representing our share of the net earnings in the ventures. Included in net earnings from our unconsolidated entities was our share of net non-cash expenses, totaling $169.3 million, $204.5 million and $156.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily due to depreciation and amortization charges. We also received additional distributions from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures in excess of our share of net earnings that is reflected in

Off-

Balance Shee

t Arrangements

Unconsolidated Co-Investment Venture Debt

We had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, at December 31, 2015, of $4.6 billion. These ventures had total third-party debt of $6.2 billion (of which $1.8 billion was our proportionate share) at December 31, 2015. This debt is primarily secured, is non-recourse to Prologis or the other investors in the co-investment ventures and matures as follows (dollars in millions):

At December 31, 2015, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the co-investment ventures. In our role as the manager, we work with the co-investment ventures to refinance their maturing debt. There can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. If the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. Certain of our ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds.

Contractual Obligations

Long-Term Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our long-term contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 (in millions):

(1)

We had properties in our consolidated development portfolio (completed and under development) at December 31, 2015, with a TEI of $2.9 billion. The unfunded commitments presented include not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under construction contracts, but all costs necessary to place the property into service, including the estimated costs of tenant improvements, marketing and leasing costs that we will incur as the property is leased.

Distribution and Dividend Requirements

Our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, relative to maintaining our REIT status, while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities.

In 2015, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 for the first two quarters of 2015 and $0.40 per common share for the last two quarters of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we issued a new class of common limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership that are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $0.40 per unit (see Note 11 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this new partnership unit). We paid a dividend of $0.64665 in December 2015 related to this new partnership unit. We paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.33 per common share for all four quarters of 2014. Our future common stock dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the Board upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating results and REIT distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the Board during the year.

At December 31, 2015, we had one series of preferred stock outstanding – the “Series Q preferred stock.” The annual dividend rate is 8.54% per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears.

Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.

Other Commitments

On a continuing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties.

Critical Accounting Policies

A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity’s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of


our performance.

Of the accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies.

Consolidation

We consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% of the equity but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity including whether the entity is a variable interest entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary. We consider the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Investments in entities that we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Combinations

Upon acquisition of real estate that constitutes a business, which includes acquiring a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based on the fair value of each component. The components typically include land, building, intangible assets related to the acquired leases, debt, deferred tax liability and other assumed assets and liabilities in the case of an acquisition of a business. In an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. The fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties. In the case of an acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting, this allocation may result in a gain or a loss. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, not to exceed one year. The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses.

Revenue Recognition – Gains (Losses) on Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate and Strategic Capital Revenue

We recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets, generally at the time the title is transferred, consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold. In many of our transactions, an entity in which we have an equity investment will acquire a real estate asset from us. We make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that acquires the assets. In addition, we make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives earned for services provided to these entities based on when they are earned, fixed and determinable.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception, and over the term of the instruments, the hedged item and derivative qualify for hedge accounting. The rules and interpretations for derivatives are complex. Failure to apply this guidance correctly may result in all changes in fair value of the hedged derivative being recognized in earnings.

We assess both at inception, and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. Any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instrument's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Derivatives not designated as hedges are used to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and variable interest rates but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our derivative financial instrument policy.

Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability for each taxable entity, the liability associated with open tax years that are under review, our REIT taxable income and our compliance with REIT requirements. Our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws. We estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. These estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities; changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain nonroutine transactions; changes due to audit adjustments by federal, international and state tax authorities; our inability to qualify as a REIT; the potential for built-in gain recognition; changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable REIT subsidiaries and changes in tax laws. Adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.

Other than Temporary Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

When circumstances indicate the value of an equity investment may be reduced, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If we determine that a loss in value is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value. The use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value, the determination of when a loss is other than temporary and the calculation of the amount of the loss is complex and subjective. Use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions. Changes in economic and operating conditions, as well as changes in our intent with regard to our investment that occur subsequent to our review, could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.

Recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated NOI of a property, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a real estate property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property. Assumptions and estimates used in


the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subj

ective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our long-lived assets.

Capitalization of Costs

We capitalize costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. During the land development and construction periods, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets.

New Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fu

nds from Operations attributable to common stockholders and unitholders (“FFO”)

FFO is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with GAAP, but is a measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings. Although the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) has published a definition of FFO, modifications to the NAREIT calculation of FFO are common among REITs, as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business.

FFO is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present, nor do we intend it to present, a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance. We believe that FFO is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP. Furthermore, we believe our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition.

NAREIT’s FFO measure adjusts net earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We agree that these NAREIT adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons:

·

historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes, through depreciation charges, that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. NAREIT stated in its White Paper on FFO “since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.” Consequently, NAREIT’s definition of FFO reflects the fact that real estate, as an asset class, generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by GAAP do not reflect the underlying economic realities. We exclude depreciation from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties’ share of our consolidated ventures.

·

REITs were created in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long-term ownership and management of real estate. The exclusion, in NAREIT’s definition of FFO, of gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT’s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. We include the gains and losses (including impairment charges) from dispositions of land and development properties, as well as our proportionate share of the gains and losses (including impairment charges) from dispositions of development properties recognized by our unconsolidated and consolidated entities, in our definition of FFO. We exclude the gain on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest from our definition of FFO.

Our FFO Measures

At the same time that NAREIT created and defined its FFO measure for the REIT industry, it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community.” We believe stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined FFO measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under GAAP in addition to those included in the NAREIT defined measure of FFO. Our FFO measures are used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses.

We calculate our FFO measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. We reflect our share of our FFO measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our FFO measures to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.

We use these FFO measures, including by segment and region, to: (i) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions; (ii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (iv) assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general; and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. Because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long-term outlook, we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of short-term items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long-term performance of the properties. The long-term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental revenue. While not infrequent or unusual, these additional items we exclude in calculating FFO, as defined by Prologis, defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.

We use our FFO measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.


FFO, as defined by Prologis attributable to common stockholders and unitholders (“FFO, as defined by Prologis”)

To arrive at

FFO, as defined by Prologis

, we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude:

·

deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;

·

current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in GAAP earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure;

·

unhedged foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities;

·

foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement (based on current foreign currency exchange rates) of certain third-party debt of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities; and

·

mark-to-market adjustments and related amortization of debt discounts associated with derivative financial instruments.

We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy.

Core FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders (“Core FFO”)

In addition to

FFO, as defined by Prologis

,

we also use

Core FFO

. To arrive at

Core

FFO

,

we adjust

FFO, as defined by Prologis,

to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in

FFO, as defined by Prologis

:

·

gains or losses from contribution or sale of land or development properties;

·

income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate and third-party acquisition costs related to the acquisition of real estate;

·

impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;

·

gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock; and

·

expenses related to natural disasters.

We believe it is appropriate to further adjust our

FFO, as defined by Prologis

for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets, rather than factors specific to the on-going operating performance of our properties or investments. The impairment charges we have recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate, which had declined due to market conditions, that we no longer expected to hold for long-term investment. Over the last few years, we made it a priority to strengthen our financial position by reducing our debt, our investment in certain low yielding assets and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. As a result, we changed our intent to sell or contribute certain of our real estate properties and recorded impairment charges when we did not expect to recover the costs of our investment. Also, we purchased portions of our debt securities when we believed it was advantageous to do so, which was based on market conditions, and in an effort to lower our borrowing costs and extend our debt maturities. As a result, we have recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time.

We analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenue driven by our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities. Although these items discussed above have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term.

We use

Core FFO

, including by segment and region, to: (i) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions; (ii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (iv) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; (v) assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. Because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long-term outlook, we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long-term performance of the properties we own. As noted above, we believe the long-term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental revenue. We believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy.

Limitations on the use of our FFO measures

While we believe our defined FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT’s nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some of these limitations are:

·

The current income tax expenses and acquisition costs that are excluded from our defined FFO measures represent the taxes and transaction costs that are payable.

·

Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of industrial properties are not reflected in FFO.

·

Gains or losses from non-development property acquisitions and dispositions or impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of acquired or disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.

·

The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our defined FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our defined FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.


·

The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our defined FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.

·

The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our debt at less or more than our future obligation.

·

The natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred.

We compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our defined FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP for the years ended December 31 as follows (in millions):

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to the impact of foreign-exchange related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes. See our risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors, specifically the following:

The depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position

and

We may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments.

See also Notes 2 and 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments.

We monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange or interest rates at December 31, 2015. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections. The sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value. As a result, revenues and expenses, as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period, hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to foreign exchange-related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our financial results or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2015, we had net equity of approximately $1.6 billion, or 8.5% of total net equity, denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, after consideration of our derivative and nonderivative financial instruments. Based on our sensitivity analysis, a 10% reduction in exchange rates would cause a reduction of $162.1 million to our net equity.

At December 31, 2015, we had foreign currency forward contracts, which were designated and qualify as net investment hedges, with an aggregate notional amount of $386.1 million to hedge a portion of our investments in the United Kingdom. We also have foreign currency forward contracts, which were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, with an aggregate notional amount of $4.8 million to hedge cash payments for development in Mexico. On the basis of our sensitivity analysis, a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling or Mexican peso by 10% would result in a $39.1 million negative change in our cash flows on settlement. In addition, we also have British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen forward and option contracts, which were not designated as hedges, and have an aggregate notional amount of $611.7 million to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the projected financial results of our subsidiaries in Europe, Canada and Japan. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against these currencies by 10% would result in a $61.2 million negative change in our net income on settlement.


Interest Rate R

isk

We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows. At December 31, 2015, we had $2.4 billion of variable rate debt outstanding, of which $2.1 billion was outstanding on our term loans and $298.7 million was outstanding on secured mortgage debt. We had no outstanding balances on our credit facilities. At December 31, 2015, we had entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix $1.1 billion of our Japanese yen term loans (¥105.9 billion) and our Canadian term loan (CAD $371.9 million). During the year ended December 31, 2015, we had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of $257.3 million on our variable rate credit facilities. On the basis of our sensitivity analysis, a 10% adverse change in interest rates based on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances not subject to interest rate swap agreements during the period would result in additional interest expense of $2.9 million, which equates to a change in interest rates of 20 basis points.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures

Controls and Procedures (The Parent)

Prologis, Inc. carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) at December 31, 2015. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, there were no significant changes in the internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting was conducted at December 31, 2015, based on the criteria described in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that, at December 31, 2015, the internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2015, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.

Limitations of the Effectiveness of Controls

Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of the internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. The internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Prologis, Inc.:

We have audited Prologis, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Prologis, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Prologis, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Prologis, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Prologis, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, and our report dated February 19, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

(or the “Parent”) commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and believes the current organization and method of operation will enable it to maintain its status as a REIT. The Parent is the general partner of Prologis, L.P. (or the “Operating Partnership”). Through the Operating Partnership, we are engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development and management of industrial properties in global and regional markets throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our current business strategy consists of two operating business segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital. Our Real Estate Operations segment represents the ownership of industrial properties. Our Strategic Capital segment represents the management of co-investment ventures and other unconsolidated entities. See Note 18 for further discussion of our business segments. Unless otherwise indicated, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both the Parent and the Operating Partnership. The terms “the Company,” “Prologis,” “we,” “our” or “us” means the Parent and Operating Partnership collectively.

For each share of common stock or preferred stock the Parent issues, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding common or preferred partnership unit, as applicable, to the Parent in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. At December 31, 2015, the Parent owned an approximate 97.12% common general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and 100% of the preferred units in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximate 2.88% common limited partnership interests, which include 8.9 million units of Class A common limited partnership units (“Class A Units”) in the Operating Partnership, are owned by unaffiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of the Parent. Each partner’s percentage interest in the Operating Partnership is determined based on the number of Operating Partnership units owned as compared to total Operating Partnership units outstanding as of each period end and is used as the basis for the allocation of net income or loss to each partner.

At the end of each reporting period, a capital adjustment is made in the Operating Partnership to reflect the appropriate ownership interest for each of the common unitholders. These adjustments are reflected in the line items

Reallocation of Equity

and

Reallocation of Capital.

As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent has complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Operating Partnership and we operate the Parent and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management of the Parent consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. These members are officers of the Parent and employees of the Operating Partnership or one of its subsidiaries. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent consolidates the Operating Partnership. Because the Parent’s only significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership, the assets and liabilities of the Parent and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.

Information with respect to the square footage, number of buildings and acres of land is unaudited

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and are presented in our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. All material intercompany transactions with consolidated entities have been eliminated.

We consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% of the equity but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity.

For entities that are not defined as variable interest entities, we first consider whether we are the general partner or the limited partner (or the equivalent in such investments that are not structured as partnerships). We consolidate entities in which we are the general partner and the limited partners in such entities do not have rights that would preclude control. For entities in which we are the general partner but do not control the entity as the other partners hold substantive participating or kick-out rights, we apply the equity method of accounting since as the general partner we have the ability to influence the venture. For ventures for which we are a limited partner or our investment is in an entity that is not structured similar to a partnership, we consider factors such as ownership interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners. In instances where the factors indicate that we control the venture, we consolidate the entity.

Reclassifications.

Certain amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2014 and 2013 have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 financial statement presentation.

Use of Estimates.

GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we made are reasonable and appropriate, as discussed in the applicable sections throughout the Consolidated Financial Statements, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported results.

Foreign Operations.

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities operating in the United States and Mexico and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries that operate as holding companies for foreign investments. The functional currency for our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities operating in countries other than the United States and Mexico is the principal currency in which the entity’s assets, liabilities, income and expenses are denominated, which may be different from the local currency of the country of incorporation or where the entity conducts its operations.

The functional currencies of our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities generally include the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. We take part in business transactions denominated in these and other local currencies where we operate.

For our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate their financial statements into the U.S. dollar at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries’ financial statements. Generally, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are included in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (“

AOCI

”). Certain balance sheet items, primarily equity and capital-related accounts, are reflected at the historical exchange rate. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period and income statement accounts that represent significant nonrecurring transactions are translated at the rate in effect at the date of the transaction. We translate our share of the net earnings or losses of our unconsolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar at the average exchange rate for the period.


PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

We and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany and third-party debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional c

urrency. When the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity, a gain or loss can result. The resulting adjustment is reflected in results of operations, unless it is intercompany debt that is deemed to be long-term in nature and then

the adjustment is reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment in

AOCI

.

Business Combinations.

When we acquire a business or individual operating properties, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based on the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including an allocation to the individual buildings acquired. We generally acquire operating properties that meet the definition of a business and we expense transaction costs as incurred. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, not to exceed one year.

When we obtain control of an unconsolidated entity, we account for the acquisition in accordance with the guidance for a business combination achieved in stages. We remeasure our previously held interest in the unconsolidated entity at its acquisition-date fair value and recognize the resulting gain or loss, if any, in earnings at the acquisition date.

We allocate the purchase price using primarily Level 2 and Level 3 inputs (further defined in

Fair Value Measurements

below) as follows:

Investments in Real Estate Properties

. We value operating properties as if vacant. We estimate fair value generally by applying an income approach methodology using a discounted cash flow analysis. Key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis include market rents, growth rates and discount and capitalization rates. We determine discount and capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale.

Intangible Assets

. We determine the portion of the purchase price related to intangible assets as follows:

·

In-Place Leases

. We calculate the fair value of in place leases in each of the applicable markets. The value is recorded in

Other Assets

and amortized over the remaining life of the respective leases to amortization expense.

·

Above and Below Market Leases

. We recognize an asset or liability for acquired leases with favorable or unfavorable rents based on our estimate of current market rents of the applicable markets. The value is recorded in either

Other Assets

or

Other Liabilities

, as appropriate, and is amortized over the term of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal options, to rental revenue.

Debt

. We estimate the fair value of debt based on contractual future cash flows discounted using borrowing spreads and market interest rates that would be available to us for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. In the case of publicly traded debt, we estimate the fair value based on available market data. Any discount or premium to the principal amount is included in the carrying value and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt using the effective interest method.

Noncontrolling Interests

. We estimate the portion of the fair value of the net assets owned by third parties based on the fair value of the consolidated net assets, principally real estate properties and debt.

Working Capital

. We estimate fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities on the best information available.

Fair Value Measurements

. The objective of fair value is to determine the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). We estimate fair value using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that we would realize on disposition. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels:

·

Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.

·

Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

·

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements.

We estimate the fair value of our financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes as follows:

·

Debt.

We estimate the fair value of our senior notes and exchangeable senior notes for disclosure purposes based on quoted market prices for the same (Level 1) or similar (Level 2) issues when current quoted market prices are available. We estimate the fair value of our credit facilities, term loans, secured mortgage debt and assessment bonds by discounting the future cash flows using rates and borrowing spreads currently available to us (Level 3).

·

Derivatives.

We determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and implied volatilities. We determine the fair values of our interest rate swaps using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments. We base the variable cash payments on an expectation of future interest rates, or forward curves, derived from observable market interest rate curves. We base the fair values of our net investment hedges on the change in the spot rate at the end of the period as compared with the strike price at inception.

We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we consider the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.

We have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Although the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties, we assess the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.


PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis generally consist of real estate assets and investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities that were subject to impairment charges related to our change of intent to sell the investments and through our recoverability analysis discussed below. We estimate fair value based on expected sales prices in the market (Level 2).

Long-Lived Assets.

Real Estate Assets

. Real estate assets are carried at depreciated cost. We capitalize costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis of real estate assets. We expense costs for repairs and maintenance of the real estate assets as incurred.

During the land development and construction periods of qualifying projects, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and general and administrative costs of the personnel performing the development, renovation, and rehabilitation; if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to ready the asset for its intended use. We capitalize transaction costs relates to the acquisition of land for future development. We capitalize costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from and are essential to acquire that lease, including internal costs that are incremental and identifiable as leasing activities. Leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of

Other Assets

.

We charge the depreciable portions of real estate assets to depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives. Depreciation commences when the asset is ready for its intended use, which we define as the earlier of stabilization (90% occupied) or one year after completion of construction. We generally use the following useful lives: 5 to 7 years for capital improvements, 10 years for standard tenant improvements, 25 years for depreciable land improvements, 30 years for operating properties acquired and 40 years for operating properties we develop. We depreciate building improvements on land parcels subject to ground leases over the shorter of the estimated building improvement life or the contractual term of the underlying ground lease. Capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the estimated remaining lease term. Our weighted average lease term based on square feet for all leases, in effect at December 31, 2015, was six years.

We assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the real estate asset by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.

We estimate the future undiscounted cash flows based on our intent as follows:

·

for real estate properties that we intend to hold long-term; including land held for development, properties currently under development and operating buildings; recoverability is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future net rental income from operating the property and the terminal value, including anticipated costs to develop;

·

for real estate properties we intend to sell, including properties currently under development and operating buildings; recoverability is assessed based on proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on future net rental income of the property, expected market capitalization rates and anticipated costs to develop;

·

for land parcels we intend to sell, recoverability is assessed based on estimated proceeds from disposition; and

·

for costs incurred related to the potential acquisition of land or development of a real estate property, recoverability is assessed based on the probability that the acquisition or development is likely to occur at the measurement date.

Assets Held for Sale or Contribution

. We classify a property as held for sale or contribution when certain criteria are met, in accordance with GAAP. Assets classified as held for sale are expected to be sold to a third party and assets classified as held for contribution are newly developed assets we intend to contribute to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures or to a third party. At such time, the respective assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciation is no longer recognized. Assets held for sale or contribution are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value less the costs to sell the assets.

Discontinued Operations

. Under new accounting guidance issued in 2014, only disposals of a component of an entity, or a group of components of an entity, representing a strategic shift in operations would be presented as discontinued operations. Under this guidance, none of our property dispositions qualified as discontinued operations in 2015 or 2014. However, the results of operations for real estate properties sold in 2013 or held for sale at the end of the year were shown under

Discontinued Operations

in the Consolidated Statements of Income following the previous accounting standard.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

. We present our investments in certain entities under the equity method. We use the equity method when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the venture but do not have control of the entity. Under the equity method, we initially recognize these investments (including advances) in the balance sheet at our cost, including formation costs and net of deferred gains from the contribution of properties, if applicable. We subsequently adjust the accounts to reflect our proportionate share of net earnings or losses recognized and accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, distributions received, contributions made and certain other adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If we conclude it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at fair value.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

. We consider all cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We invest our cash with high-credit quality institutions. Cash balances may be invested in money market accounts that are not insured. We have not realized any losses in such cash investments or accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk.

Derivative Financial Instruments

. We may use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All of our derivative financial instruments are customized derivative transactions and are not exchange-traded. Management reviews our hedging program, derivative positions, and overall risk management strategy on a regular basis. We only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk. Our use of derivatives involves the risk that counterparties may default on a derivative contract. We establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize this risk and provide counterparty diversification. Substantially all of our derivative exposures are with counterparties that have long-term credit ratings of single-A or better. We enter into master agreements with counterparties that generally allow for netting of certain exposures; thereby significantly reducing the actual loss that would be incurred should a counterparty fail to perform its contractual obligations. To

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

mitigate pre-settlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringe

nt as the duration of the derivative financial instrument increases. On the basis of these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.

We recognize all derivatives at fair value within the line items

Other Assets

or

Other Liabilities

, as applicable. We do not net our derivative position by counterparty for purposes of balance sheet presentation and disclosure. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives are designated as, and qualify as, hedging instruments. For derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, at inception of the transaction, we formally designate and document the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, we formally assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, the effectiveness of our hedging transactions. The ineffective portion of a derivative financial instrument's change in fair value, if any, is immediately recognized in earnings. We also use derivatives that are not designated as hedges (and may not meet the hedge accounting requirements) to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in

AOCI

. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments will generally be offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair values of derivatives that were not designated or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, we reclassify changes in the fair value of derivatives into the applicable line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period that the underlying hedged items affect earnings.

Foreign Currency.

We primarily manage our foreign currency exposure by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest. In certain circumstances, we may issue debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in international subsidiaries. To mitigate the impact of the translation from the fluctuations in exchange rates, we may designate the debt as a nonderivative financial instrument hedge. We also hedge our investments in certain international subsidiaries using foreign currency derivative contracts (net investment hedges) to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries by locking in a forward exchange rate at the inception of the hedge. To the extent we have an effective hedging relationship, we report all changes in fair value of the hedged portion of the nonderivative financial instruments and net investment hedges in equity in the foreign currency translation component of

AOCI

. These amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments, which we also record in

AOCI

. The changes in fair value of the portion of the nonderivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedges are recorded directly in earnings within the line item

Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses) and Related Amortization, Net

in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We recognize ineffectiveness, if any, in earnings at the time the ineffectiveness occurred.

We may use foreign currency option contracts, including puts, calls and collars to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the translation of our projected net operating income of our international subsidiaries, principally in Canada, Europe and Japan. Put option contracts provide us with the option to exchange foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate if the foreign currency were to depreciate against the U.S. dollar. Call option contracts create an obligation to exchange foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate if the foreign currency were to appreciate against the U.S. dollar. Collar option contracts combine the put and call options into one contract to effectively lock in a range around the rate at which net operating income of our subsidiaries will be translated into U.S. dollars. Foreign currency option contracts are not designated as hedges as they do not meet hedge accounting requirements. Changes in the fair value of non-hedge designated derivatives are recorded directly in earnings within the line item

Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses) and Related Amortization, Net

.

We may also use foreign currency forwards designed as cash flow hedges to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with payments in a currency that is not the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries. To the extent we have an effective hedging relationship, we report all changes in fair value of the hedged portion of the foreign currency forwards cash flow hedges in

AOCI

. We recognize ineffectiveness, if any, in earnings at the time the ineffectiveness occurred.

Interest Rate.

Our interest rate risk management strategy is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows as well as to stabilize interest expense and manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We primarily accomplish this by issuing fixed rate debt with staggering maturities. We may enter into interest rate swap agreements, which allow us to borrow on a fixed rate basis for longer-term debt issuances, or interest rate cap agreements, which allow us to minimize the impact of increases in interest rates. We typically designate our interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements as cash flow hedges as these derivative instruments may be used to manage the interest rate risk on potential future debt issuances or to fix the interest rate on variable rate debt issuances. The maximum length of time that we hedge our exposure to future cash flows is typically 10 years or less. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements that allow us to receive variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of our agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.

We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative as a component of

AOCI

, and reclassify it to

Interest Expense

in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the corresponding period of the hedged item. To the extent the hedged debt is paid off early, we write off the remaining balance in

AOCI

and we recognize the amount in

Gains (Losses) on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net

in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We recognize losses on a derivative representing hedge ineffectiveness in

Interest Expense

at the time the ineffectiveness occurred.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Noncontrolling interests represent the share of consolidated entities owned by third parties. We recognize each noncontrolling holder’s respective share of the estimated fair value of the net assets at the date of formation or acquisition. Noncontrolling interests are subsequently adjusted for the noncontrolling holder’s share of additional contributions, distributions and their share of the net earnings or losses of each respective consolidated entity. We allocate net income to noncontrolling interests based on the weighted-average ownership interest during the period. The net income that is not attributable to us is reflected in the line item

Less Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

. We do not recognize a gain or loss on transactions with a consolidated entity in which we do not own 100% of the equity, but we reflect the difference in cash received or paid from the noncontrolling interests carrying amount as paid-in-capital.

Certain limited partnership interests are exchangeable into our common stock. Common stock issued upon exchange of a holder’s noncontrolling interest is accounted for at the carrying value of the surrendered limited partnership interest.

Costs of Raising Capital.

We treat costs incurred in connection with the issuance of common and preferred stock as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. We capitalize costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt, other than our credit facilities, as a direct deduction of

Debt

and amortize those costs to interest expense over the term of the related debt. We capitalize costs related to our credit facilities, as defined in Note 9, in

Other Assets

. Costs associated with debt modifications are expensed when incurred.

AOCI.

For the Parent, we include

AOCI

as a separate component of stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the Operating Partnership,

AOCI

is included in partners’ capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any reference to

AOCI

in this document is referring to the component of stockholders’ equity for the Parent and partners’ capital for the Operating Partnership.


PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Revenue Recognition.

Rental Revenue.

We lease our operating properties to customers under agreements that are classified as operating leases. We recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, under the terms of our leases, the majority of our rental expenses are recovered from our customers. We reflect amounts recovered from customers as revenue in the period that the applicable expenses are incurred. We make a provision for possible loss if the collection of a receivable balance is considered doubtful.

Strategic Capital Revenue.

Strategic capital revenue includes revenue we earn from the management services we provide to unconsolidated entities. These fees are determined in accordance with the terms specific to each arrangement and may include property and asset management fees or transactional fees for leasing, acquisition, development, construction, financing, legal and tax services provided. We may also earn incentive returns (called “promotes”) based on third-party investor returns over time, which may be during the duration of the venture or at the time of liquidation. We recognize fees when they are earned, fixed and determinable. We report these fees in

Strategic Capital Revenue

. The fees we earn to develop properties within these ventures are reflected in

Development Management and Other Revenue

on a percentage of completion basis.

We also earned fees from ventures that we consolidate. Upon consolidation these fees were eliminated from our earnings and the third party share of these fees were recognized as a reduction of

Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.

Gains (Losses) on Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate.

We recognize gains on the disposition of real estate when the recognition criteria have been met, generally at the time the risks and rewards and title have transferred and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold. We recognize losses from the disposition of real estate when known.

When we contribute a property to an unconsolidated entity in which we have an ownership interest, we do not recognize a portion of the gain realized. The amount of gain not recognized, based on our ownership interest in the entity acquiring the property, is deferred by recognizing a reduction to our investment in the applicable unconsolidated entity. We adjust our proportionate share of net earnings or losses recognized in future periods to reflect the entities’ recorded depreciation expense as if it were computed on our lower basis in the contributed properties rather than on the entity’s basis.

When a property that we originally contributed to an unconsolidated entity is disposed of to a third party, we recognize the amount of the gain we previously deferred, along with our proportionate share of the gain recognized by the unconsolidated entity. If our ownership interest in an unconsolidated entity decreases and the decrease is expected to be permanent, we recognize the amounts relating to previously deferred gains to coincide with our new ownership interest.

Rental Expenses.

Rental expenses primarily include the cost of our property management personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, property insurance and real estate taxes.

Strategic Capital Expenses.

Strategic capital expenses generally include the direct expenses associated with the asset management of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures provided by our employees who are assigned to our Strategic Capital segment. In addition, in order to achieve efficiencies and economies of scale, all of our property management functions are provided by property management personnel who are assigned to our Real Estate Operations segment. These individuals perform the property-level management of the properties in our owned and managed portfolio, which include properties we consolidate and those we manage that are owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We allocate the costs of our property management to the properties we consolidate (included in

Rental Expenses

) and the properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures (included in

Strategic Capital Expenses

) by using the square feet owned by the respective portfolios.

Equity-Based Compensation.

We account for equity-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. We recognize the cost of the award on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, generally the vesting period.

Income Taxes.

Under the Internal Revenue Code, REITs are generally not required to pay federal income taxes if they distribute 100% of their taxable income and meet certain income, asset and stockholder tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. Even as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our own income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.

We have elected taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) status for some of our consolidated subsidiaries. This allows us to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs. Many of the foreign countries in which we have operations do not recognize REITs or do not accord REIT status under their respective tax laws to our entities that operate in their jurisdiction. In the United States, we are taxed in certain states in which we operate. Accordingly, we recognize income tax expense for the federal and state income taxes incurred by our TRSs, taxes incurred in certain states and foreign jurisdictions, and interest and penalties associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities.

We evaluate tax positions taken in the Consolidated Financial Statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.

We recognize deferred income taxes in certain taxable entities. For federal income tax purposes, certain acquisitions have been treated as tax-free transactions resulting in a carry-over basis in assets and liabilities. For financial reporting purposes and in accordance with purchase accounting, we record all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. For our taxable subsidiaries, including certain international jurisdictions, we recognize the deferred income tax liabilities that represent the tax effect of the difference between the tax basis carried over and the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets at the date of acquisition. Any subsequent increases or decreases to the deferred income tax liability recorded in connection with these acquisitions, related to tax uncertainties acquired, are reflected in earnings.

Deferred income tax expense is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes) and the utilization of tax net operating losses (“NOL”) generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets. We provide for a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets if we believe all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances that causes a change in the estimated ability to realize the related deferred income tax asset is included in deferred tax expense.

We incur certain environmental remediation costs, including cleanu

p costs, consulting fees for environmental studies and investigations, monitoring costs, and legal costs relating to cleanup, litigation defense, and the pursuit of responsible third parties. We expense costs incurred in connection with operating propertie

s and properties previously sold. We capitalize costs related to undeveloped land as development costs and include any expected future environmental liabilities at the time of acquisition. We include costs incurred for properties to be disposed in the cost

of the properties upon disposition. We maintain a liability for the estimated costs of environmental remediation expected to be incurred in connection with undeveloped land, operating properties and properties previously sold that we adjust as appropriate

as information becomes available.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update that amends the retroactive requirement to apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The update requires that the acquirer record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. We early adopted this standard at September 30, 2015, including business combinations with open measurement periods for which the accounting had not been finalized at September 30, 2015. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this standard at December 31, 2015, and applied its provisions retrospectively. The adoption resulted in the reclassification of $52.3 million and $43.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs from

Other Assets

to

Debt

at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that amends the consolidation requirements in existing GAAP. Under the update, all entities, including limited partnerships and similar legal entities, are now within the scope of consolidation guidance, unless a scope exception applies. The presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership has been eliminated. In addition, fees paid to decision makers that meet certain conditions no longer cause the decision makers to consolidate variable interest entities (“VIEs”). It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted and allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective adoption approach. We plan to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2016. We are finalizing our analysis, but we do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires companies to use a five step model to determine when to recognize revenue from customer contracts in an effort to increase consistency and comparability throughout global capital markets and across industries. Under the model, a company will identify the contract, identify any separate performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price and recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB also permits early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 3. Business Combinations

Acquisition of KTR Capital Partners and Its Affiliates

On May 29, 2015, we acquired the high quality real estate assets and operating platform with high profile customers and comparable market composition to ours from KTR Capital Partners and its affiliates (“KTR”). The portfolio consisted of 315 operating properties, aggregating 59 million square feet, 3.6 million square feet of properties under development and land parcels that will support an estimated build out of 6.8 million square feet. The properties were acquired by our consolidated co-investment venture Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture (“USLV”), of which we own 55%. The acquisition was funded through cash (which included the contribution of $2.3 billion from our venture partner and the proceeds of newly issued debt by us, as detailed in Note 9), the assumption of secured mortgage debt and the issuance of 4.5 million common limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership. We incurred $24.7 million of acquisition costs during the second quarter of 2015, which are included in

Other Expense

.

The allocation of the purchase price required a significant amount of judgment and was based on our valuations, estimates and assumptions of the acquisition date fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. While the preliminary allocation of the purchase price is substantially complete, the valuation of the real estate properties is still being finalized. We do not expect future revisions, if any, to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

The allocation of the purchase price was as follows (in thousands):

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents our results as though the KTR acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2014. The pro forma information does not reflect the actual results of operations had the transaction actually been completed on January 1, 2014, and it is not indicative of future operating results. The results for the year ended December 31, 2015, include approximately seven months of actual results for the acquisition, the acquisition expenses, and five months of pro forma adjustments. Our results of operations in 2015 include rental revenue and rental expenses of the properties acquired of $235.7 million and $56.9 million, respectively, representing the period from acquisition through December 31, 2015.

The followi

ng amounts are in thousands, except per share amounts:

These results include certain adjustments, primarily: (i) decreased revenues from the amortization of the net assets from the acquired leases with net favorable rents relative to estimated market rents; (ii) increased depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the adjustment of real estate assets to estimated fair value and recognition of intangible assets related to in-place leases; and (iii) additional interest expense attributable to the debt issued to finance our cash portion of the acquisition offset by lower interest expense due to the accretion of the fair value adjustment of debt assumed.

Acquisition of a Controlling Interest in Prologis North American Industrial Fund

During 2014, we increased our ownership in Prologis North American Industrial Fund (“NAIF”) from 23.1% to 66.1% by acquiring the equity units from all but one partner for an aggregate of $679.0 million. This included the acquisition of $46.8 million of equity units on October 20, 2014, that resulted in our gaining control over NAIF, based on the rights of the limited partners, and therefore we began consolidating NAIF at that date. We recognized a gain of $201.3 million in

.

The total purchase price was $1.1 billion, which included our investment in NAIF at the time of consolidation. The adjustments finalizing the purchase price allocation during the measurement period were not considered to be material to our financial position or results of operations.

The allocation of the purchase price was as follows (in thousands):

Our results of operations for 2014 included rental revenue and rental expenses of the properties acquired in the NAIF acquisition of $49.2 million and $13.3 million, respectively, offset by the impact of noncontrolling interests.

2013 Acquisitions of Controlling Interests in Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures

During 2013, we acquired real estate from three unconsolidated co-investment ventures through the conclusion of the venture or the acquisition of our partner’s interest. In connection with these transactions, we remeasured our equity investment to fair value and recognized gains of $34.8 million in

. The fair value was primarily based on external valuations.

·

On October 2, 2013, we acquired our partner’s 78.4% interest in the unconsolidated co-investment venture Prologis SGP Mexico and concluded the venture. The allocation of net assets acquired was $409.5 million in real estate properties, $4.0 million of net other assets and $158.4 million in debt. All properties acquired in the transaction were contributed in June 2014 to an unconsolidated co-investment venture in Mexico, as discussed in Note 4.

·

On August 6, 2013, we concluded the unconsolidated co-investment venture Prologis North American Industrial Fund III. The venture sold 73 properties to a third party and we subsequently acquired the remaining properties through the purchase of our partner’s 80% ownership interest in the venture. The allocation of net assets acquired was $519.2 million in real estate properties and $22.0 million of net other assets. These properties were contributed in January 2014 to a consolidated venture in which we own 55% of the equity as discussed in Note 12.

·

In the second quarter of 2013, we concluded an unconsolidated co-investment venture in Japan.

The results of operations for these properties were not significant in 2013.

Detail of Significant Transactions with Co-Investment Ventures (Related Parties)

Below are the significant contributions to our co-investment ventures, which are also included in the table above. We had no significant contributions in 2015.

In the second quarter of 2014, we launched the initial public offering of FIBRA Prologis, a Mexican REIT. In connection with the offering, FIBRA Prologis purchased 177 properties aggregating 29.7 million square feet (12.6 million square feet related to our wholly owned portfolio, 7.6 million square feet from our consolidated co-investment venture Prologis Mexico Fondo Logistico (“AFORES”) and 9.5 million square feet from our unconsolidated co-investment venture Prologis Mexico Industrial Fund). Also in 2014, AFORES contributed its remaining operating properties and the balance of its secured debt to FIBRA Prologis in two separate transactions. The difference between the amount received and the noncontrolling interests balance related to the properties contributed was $34.6 million, and was adjusted through equity with no gain or loss recognized. On the basis of this transaction, we recognized a gain on disposition of investments in real estate of $52.5 million; current tax expense of $32.4 million; deferred tax benefit of $55.5 million; and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest of $61.0 million.

In the first quarter of 2013, we completed the initial public offering of Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. (“NPR”), a publicly traded company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. NPR acquired a portfolio of 12 properties totaling 9.6 million square feet from us for an aggregate purchase price of ¥173 billion ($1.9 billion). As a result of this transaction, we recognized a gain on disposition of investments in real estate of $337.9 million, net of a $59.6 million deferral due to our ongoing investment.

Also during the first quarter of 2013, we closed Prologis European Logistics Partners Sàrl (“PELP”), a European joint venture with Norges Bank Investment Management (“NBIM”). The venture acquired a portfolio from us for approximately €2.3 billion ($3.0 billion) consisting of 195 properties and 48.7 million square feet in Europe. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a gain on disposition of investments in real estate of $1.8 million, net of a deferred gain due to our ongoing investment. In connection with the closing, a warrant NBIM received at signing to acquire six million shares of our common stock with a strike price of $35.64 became exercisable. We used a Black-Scholes pricing model to value the warrant and this value was included as consideration in the overall result of the transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2014, NBIM exercised the warrant for an aggregate strike price of $213.8 million.

Operating Lease Agreements

We lease our operating properties and certain land parcels to customers under agreements that are generally classified as operating leases. Our weighted average lease term, based on square feet for all leases in effect at December 31, 2015, was six years. Our largest customer and 25 largest customers accounted for 4.5% and 20.0%, respectively, of our net effective rent (“NER”) at December 31, 2015. We calculate NER using the estimated total cash to be received over the term of the lease (including base rent and expense reimbursements) divided by the lease term to determine the amount of rent and expense reimbursements received per year.

The following table summarizes our minimum lease payments on leases with lease periods greater than one year for space in our operating properties, pre-stabilized development properties and leases of land subject to ground leases at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

These amounts do not reflect future rental revenues from the renewal or replacement of existing leases and exclude reimbursements of operating expenses.

Lease Commitments

We have entered into operating ground leases as a lessee on certain land parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms of 1 to 74 years. The following table summarizes our future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

Note 5. Unconsolidated Entities

Summary of Investments

We have investments in entities through a variety of ventures. We co-invest in entities that own multiple properties with partners and investors and provide asset and property management services to these entities, which we refer to as co-investment ventures. These entities may be consolidated or unconsolidated, depending on the structure, our partner’s participation and other rights and our level of control of the entity. This note details our investments in unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See Note 12 for more detail regarding our consolidated investments.

We also have other ventures, generally with one partner and that we do not manage, which we account for using the equity method. We refer to our investments in all entities accounted for using the equity method, both unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures, collectively, as unconsolidated entities.

We have a 50% ownership interest in and consolidate an entity that in turn owns 50% of several entities that we account for on the equity method. Also, we have additional investments in other unconsolidated entities in Brazil that we account for on the equity method with various ownership interests ranging from 5-50%.

(5)

We have one partner in each of these co-investment ventures.

(6)

At December 31, 2015, we owned 261,310 units of

NPR that

had a closing price of ¥218,500 ($1,815) per share on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had receivables from NPR of $85.2 million and $85.9 million, respectively, related to customer security deposits that originated through a leasing company owned by us that pertain to properties owned by NPR.

Equity Commitments Related to Certain Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures

Certain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. Our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. We may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash. The venture may obtain financing for the properties and therefore the acquisition price of additional investments that the venture could make may be more than the equity commitment. Depending on market conditions, the investment objectives of the ventures, our liquidity needs and other factors, we may make additional contributions of properties or additional cash investments in these ventures through the remaining commitment period.

The following table summarizes the remaining equity commitments at December 31, 2015 (in millions):

(1)

Equity commitments are denominated in euro and reported in U.S. dollars based on an exchange rate of $1.09 U.S. dollars to the euro.

Credit Facilities

We have a global senior credit facility (the “Global Facility”), under which we may draw in U.S. dollars, euro, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling and Canadian dollars on a revolving basis up to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2015 (subject to currency fluctuations). The Global Facility is scheduled to mature on July 11, 2017; however, we may extend the maturity date twice, by six months each, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of extension fees. Pricing under the Global Facility, including the spread over LIBOR, facility fees and letter of credit fees, varies based on the public debt ratings of the Operating Partnership. The Global Facility contains customary representations, covenants and defaults (including a cross-acceleration to other recourse indebtedness of more than $50.0 million).

We also have a ¥45 billion ($373.8 million at December 31, 2015) Japanese yen revolver (the “Revolver”) with the ability to increase to ¥56.5 billion ($469.3 million at December 31, 2015) subject to obtaining additional lender commitments. Pricing under the Revolver was consistent with the Global Facility at December 31, 2015.

Senior Notes

The senior notes are unsecured and our obligations are effectively subordinated in certain respects to any of our debt that is secured by a lien on real property, to the extent of the value of such real property. The senior notes require interest payments be made quarterly, semi-annually or annually. All of the senior notes are redeemable at any time at our option, subject to certain prepayment penalties. Such repurchase and other terms are governed by the provisions of indenture agreements, various note purchase agreements or trust deeds.

During the years ended December 31 we issued the following senior notes (dollars and euros in thousands):

(1)

This debt is denominated in euro and the exchange rate used to calculate into U.S. dollar was the effective rate at the date of the transaction.

Exchangeable Senior Notes

Our exchangeable senior notes were issued by the Operating Partnership and were exchangeable into common stock of the Parent. The accounting for the exchangeable senior notes required us to separate the fair value of the derivative instrument (exchange feature) from the debt instrument and account for it separately as a derivative. At December 31, 2014, we adjusted the derivative instrument to fair value, which was reflected in

Other Liabilities

. During the reporting periods, any adjustments to the fair value of the derivative were recorded in earnings as

Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses) and Related Amortization, Net

. The derivative on the debt instrument was amortized over the remaining term of the exchangeable notes. During March 2015, the holders of the exchangeable notes exchanged $459.8 million of their notes for 11.9 million shares of common stock of the Parent and $0.2 million of their notes for cash.

The fair value of the derivative associated with the exchangeable debt was a liability of $51.3 million at December 31, 2014. The fair value of the exchange option was $43.0 million immediately before the exchange in March 2015. When the debt was exchanged into common stock, the value of the derivative associated with the debt was reclassified to

TMK bonds are a financing vehicle in Japan for special purpose companies known as TMKs. During 2015, we issued new TMK bonds (with interest rates ranging from 0.6% to 0.8% scheduled to mature from September 2016 and October 2016) totaling ¥23.0 billion ($191.0 million at December 31, 2015). During 2014, we issued ¥7.2 billion ($70.7 million) of new TMK bonds and paid off or transferred all of our outstanding TMK bonds, leaving no TMK bonds outstanding at December 31, 2014.

Debt Covenants

We have approximately $6.5 billion of senior notes and $2.1 billion of term loans outstanding at December 31, 2015 that were issued under three separate indentures, as supplemented, and are subject to certain financial covenants. We are also subject to financial covenants under our Credit Facilities and certain secured mortgage debt. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.

Included in 2017 maturities is the Euro Term Loan that can be extended until 2019.

Interest Expense

The following table summarizes the components of interest expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):

Early Extinguishment of Debt

In an effort to reduce our borrowing costs and extend our debt maturities, we repurchased certain debt, principally outstanding senior notes and secured mortgage debt, generally with proceeds from the issuance of senior notes outlined above, and in 2013, an equity offering (as described in Note 10). As a result, we recognized a gain or loss represented by the difference between the recorded debt (including premiums and discounts and related debt costs) and the consideration we paid to retire the debt, including fees.

Note 10. Stockholders’ Equity of Prologis, Inc.

Shares Authorized

At December 31, 2015, 1.1 billion shares were authorized to be issued by the Parent, of which 1.0 billion shares represent common stock. Our board of directors (the “Board”) may, without stockholder approval, classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our stock from time to time by setting or changing the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of such shares.

Common Stock

We issued 1.7 million and 3.3 million shares of common stock under our at-the-market (“ATM”) program during 2015 and 2014, respectively, which generated $71.5 million and $140.1 million in net proceeds, respectively. We have an equity distribution agreement that allows us to sell up to $750.0 million aggregate gross sales proceeds of shares of common stock, of which $535.2 million remains available for sale, through six designated agents, who earn a fee of up to 2% of the gross proceeds, as agreed to on a transaction-by-transaction basis.

Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”), certain of our employees and outside directors are able to participate in equity-based compensation plans. Under this plan, we received gross proceeds for the issuance of common stock of $18.2 million, $25.8 million and $22.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectfully. See Note 13 for additional information on this plan.

As discussed in Note 4, in 2014 NBIM exercised a warrant and paid $213.8 million in exchange for 6.0 million shares of common stock.

On April 30, 2013, we completed a public offering of 35.65 million shares of common stock at a price of $41.60 per share, generating approximately $1.4 billion in net proceeds.

Preferred Stock

At December 31, 2015 and 2014 we had one series of preferred stock outstanding, the Series Q preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $50 per share, a par value of $0.01 and a dividend rate of 8.54%, which will be redeemable at our option on or after November 13, 2026. Holders have, subject to certain conditions, limited voting rights and all holders are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends based on liquidation preference. The dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each quarter. Dividends are payable when, and if, they have been declared by the Board, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends.

During 2014, we repurchased approximately 435,000 shares of Series Q preferred stock and recognized a loss of $6.5 million, which primarily represented the difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred stock net of original issuance costs. In 2013, we redeemed all of the outstanding Series L, M, O, P, R and S preferred stock and recognized a loss of $9.1 million when we notified the holders of our intent to redeem these series of preferred stock.

Ownership Restrictions

For us to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals may not own more than 50% of the value of our outstanding stock at any time during the last half of our taxable year. Therefore, our charter restricts beneficial ownership (or ownership generally attributed to a person under the REIT rules), by a person, or persons acting as a group, of issued and outstanding common and preferred stock that would cause that person to own or be deemed to own more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our issued and outstanding capital stock. Furthermore, subject to certain exceptions, no person shall at any time directly or indirectly acquire ownership of more than 25% of any of the preferred stock. These provisions assist us in protecting and preserving our REIT status and protect the interests of stockholders in takeover transactions by preventing the acquisition of a substantial block of outstanding shares of stock.

Shares of stock owned by a person or group of people in excess of these limits are subject to redemption by us. The provision does not apply where a majority of the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, waives such limit after determining that our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes will not be jeopardized.

Dividends

To comply with the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, we are generally required to make common and preferred stock dividends (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders in amounts that together at least equal (i) the sum of (a) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains and (b) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (ii) certain excess non-cash income. Our common stock distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow that ensures that we will meet the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and that allows us to also retain cash to meet other needs, such as capital improvements and other investment activities.

Our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2015 has not been filed. The taxability information presented for our dividends paid in 2015 is based on management’s estimate. Our tax returns for open tax years have not been examined by the Internal Revenue Service, other than those discussed in Note 14. Consequently, the taxability of dividends is subject to change.


PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we paid all of our dividends in cash. The following summarizes the taxability of our common and preferred stock dividends for the years ended December 31:

(1)

Items indicated by ‘- -‘ are not applicable.

(2)

Taxability for 2015 is estimated.

(3)

As discussed above, in April 2013, we redeemed all of the outstanding series L, M, O, P, R and S preferred stock.

Common stock dividends are characterized for federal income tax purposes as ordinary income, qualified dividend, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital or a combination of the four. Common stock dividends that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits (calculated for tax purposes) constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend and generally reduce the stockholder’s basis in the common stock. To the extent that a dividend exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder’s basis in the common stock, it will generally be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder’s common stock. At the beginning of each year, we notify our stockholders of the taxability of the common stock dividends paid during the preceding year.

Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.

Note 11. Partners’ Capital of Prologis, L.P.

Distributions paid to the common limited partnership units and the taxability of those distributions are similar to the Parent’s common stock disclosed above.

In May 2015, we issued 4.5 million common limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership in connection with the KTR acquisition (see Note 3 for more details on the transaction).

In connection with the acquisition of a portfolio of properties in October 2015, we issued 0.2 million common limited partnership units and 8.9 million Class A Units. The number of units issued was based upon an agreed upon price and had a per unit weighted average fair value at the date of issuance of $41.06. The Class A Units generally have the same rights as the existing common units of the Operating Partnership, except that the Class A Units are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $0.40 per unit (in the event the common units receive a quarterly distribution of less than $0.40 per unit, the Class A Unit distribution would be reduced by a proportionate amount). Class A Units are convertible into common units at an initial conversion rate of one-for-one. The conversion rate will be increased or decreased to the extent that, at the time of conversion, the net present value of the distributions paid with respect to the Class A Units are less or more than the distributions paid on common units from the time of issuance of the Class A Units until the time of conversion. At December 31, 2015, the Class A Units were convertible into 8.8 million common units. The Operating Partnership may redeem the Class A Units at any time after October 7, 2025, for an amount in cash equal to the then-current number of the common units into which the Class A Units are convertible, multiplied by $43.11, subject to the holders’ right to convert the Class A Units into common units.

Distributions paid on the common units and Class A Units, and the taxability of those distributions, are similar to dividends paid on the Parent’s common stock disclosed above.

Note 12. Noncontrolling Interests

Prologis, L.P.

We report noncontrolling interests related to several entities we consolidate but of which we do not own 100% of the equity. These entities include two real estate partnerships that have issued limited partnership units to third parties. Depending on the specific partnership agreements, these limited partnership units are exchangeable into shares of the Parent’s common stock (or cash), generally at a rate of one share of common stock to one unit. We evaluated the noncontrolling interests with redemption provisions that permit the issuer to settle in either cash or common stock at the option of the issuer to determine whether temporary or permanent equity classification on the balance sheet is appropriate, including the requirement to settle in unregistered shares, and determined that these units meet the requirements to qualify for presentation as permanent equity. We also consolidate several entities in which we do not own 100% of the equity and the units of these entities are not exchangeable into our common stock.


PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

As discussed in Note 3, we began consolidating the co-investment venture NAIF in 2014.

In the first quarter of 2014, we formed a new U.S. co-investment venture, USLV, in which we hold a 55% equity ownership interest and have one partner. The venture is consolidated due to the structure and voting rights of the venture. At closing, the venture acquired from us a portfolio of 66 operating properties aggregating 12.8 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion.

Prologis, Inc.

The noncontrolling interests of the Parent include the noncontrolling interests presented in the Operating Partnership, as well as the common limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership that are not owned by the Parent.

During 2013, net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were $10.1 million, of which $0.5 million was a loss from continuing operations and $10.6 million was income from discontinued operations.

The following table summarizes our noncontrolling interests and the consolidated entity’s total investment in real estate and debt at December 31 (dollars and units in thousands):

(1)

As discussed in Note 3, USLV acquired a portfolio of properties from KTR in May 2015. We received a contribution of $2.3 billion from our venture partner to fund their share of this acquisition.

(2)

The assets of Prologis Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I (“Brazil Fund”) are primarily investments in unconsolidated entities of $103.1 million and $152.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional information on our unconsolidated investments, see Note 5.

(3)

This line item includes our two partnerships that have issued limited partnership units to third parties, as discussed above, along with various other consolidated entities. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, limited partnership units were exchangeable into cash or, at our option, 1,835 and 1,887 shares, respectively, of the Parent’s common stock. In 2015, 52 limited partnership units were redeemed for cash of $3.2 million. All of these outstanding limited partnership units receive quarterly cash distributions equal to the quarterly dividends paid on our common stock pursuant to the terms of the applicable partnership agreements.

(4)

Includes 8.9 million of Class A Units issued in the fourth quarter of 2015. See Note 11 for further discussion of our Class A Units.

(5)

We issued 4.7 million common limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership, principally in connection with the KTR acquisition.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, excluding the Class A Units, there were common limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership that were exchangeable into cash or, at our option, 6.4 million and 1.8 million shares of the Parent’s common stock. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the 6.4 million and 1.8 million shares, respectively, would be $275.0 million and $76.0 million, respectively, based on the closing stock price of the Parent’s common stock. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were 1.2 million and 0.1 million LTIP Units (as defined in Note 13) outstanding, respectively, associated with our long-term compensation plan that are not exchangeable into common units of the Operating Partnership and redeemable into the Parent’s common stock until they vest and other applicable conditions are met. All of these outstanding limited partnership units receive quarterly cash distributions equal to the quarterly distributions paid on our common stock pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement.

Note 13. Long-Term Compensation

In May 2012, stockholders approved the 2012 LTIP. All outstanding awards granted under the previous plans remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. The 2012 LTIP provides for grants of awards to officers, directors, employees, and consultants of the Parent or its subsidiaries. Awards can be in the form of stock options (non-qualified options and incentive stock options), stock appreciation rights and full value awards (restricted stock, restricted stock units, Operating Partnership units (“LTIP Units”), special outperformance plan type of LTIP Units and cash incentive awards). No participant can be granted more than 1.5 million awards under the 2012 LTIP in any one calendar year. Awards may be made under the 2012 LTIP until it is terminated by the Board or until the ten-year anniversary of the effective date of the plan. We began granting awards in the form of LTIP Units during 2014. An LTIP Unit represents a partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. After vesting and the satisfaction of certain conditions, an LTIP Unit may be exchangeable for a common unit in the Operating Partnership and then redeemable for a share of common stock.

We have 27.2 million shares reserved for issuance, of which 21.7 million shares of common stock were available for future issuance at December 31, 2015. Each LTIP Unit counts as one share of common stock for purposes of calculating the limit on shares that may be issued.

Outperformance Plan (“OPP”)

We grant awards in the form of points under our OPP corresponding to three-year performance periods. The fair value of the awards are measured at the grant date and amortized over the performance period. OPP awards are earned to the extent our total stockholder return (“TSR”) for the performance period exceeds the TSR for the Morgan Stanley Capital International (“MSCI”) US REIT Index for the same period plus 100 basis points. If this outperformance hurdle is met, the compensation pool is equal to 3% of the excess value created, subject to a maximum of the greater of $75 million or 0.5% of our equity market capitalization at the start of the performance period. Each participant is allocated a percentage of the total compensation pool. Awards earned at the end of the performance period cannot be paid to participants


PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

unless our absolute TSR, as defined in the plan, is positive for the performance period. If we outperform the TSR for the MSCI US REIT Index plus 100 basis points, but the absolute TSR is not positive, payment will

be delayed until such time as our absolute TSR becomes positive. If after seven years our absolute TSR has not become positive, the awards will be forfeited.

We used the Monte Carlo valuation model to value the points granted under the OPP. The points relate to a three-year performance period that begins on January 1 of the year granted. If the performance criteria are met, the participants’ points will be paid in the form of common stock or LTIP Units. In 2014, we began offering participants the election to choose the form of payment of awards earned, if any, in common stock of the Parent or a special OPP type of LTIP Units (the “OPP LTIP Units”) that represents restricted operating partnership units in the Operating Partnership. If the performance criteria are not met, the participation points and the OPP LTIP Units will be forfeited. At December 31, 2015, all awards are equity classified.

The following table details the assumptions of each grant based on the year it was granted (dollars in thousands):

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the performance criteria were not met for the 2012 and 2013 grant, respectively, therefore, no awards were earned and the points and OPP LTIP Units for the 2012 – 2014 and the 2013 – 2015 performance periods were forfeited. As the OPP has market-based performance criteria, the expense recognized is not adjusted if no awards were earned.

Prologis Promote Plan (“PPP”)

Under the PPP, we established a compensation pool equal to 40% of the aggregate promotes earned by Prologis under agreements with our co-investment ventures, representing the third-party portion. The awards may be settled in some combination of cash or RSUs in accordance with the terms of the PPP and, starting in August 2014, participants may elect to receive LTIP Units in lieu of RSUs. The RSUs and LTIP Units have a three-year vesting period. At the beginning of each year, each participant is allocated a percentage of the total compensation pool for each applicable new co-investment venture. We record an accrual for the estimated cash portion of the PPP at the time the revenue is recognized and recognized the expense of the equity award during the vesting period.

A compensation pool was funded in each of the three years ended December 31 associated with promotes earned from our co-investment ventures, as discussed in Note 5. We accrued $4.7 million associated with the cash awards for the promotes earned in the fourth quarter of 2015. The equity awards will be granted in 2016 when the promote is received. The total value of the awards in 2014 was $11.3 million, of which $4.2 million was paid in cash and approximately 57,000 RSUs were issued with a grant date fair value of $2.4 million and approximately 113,000 LTIP Units were issued with a grant date fair value of $4.7 million. The total value of the awards in 2013 was $5.3 million, of which $2.7 million was paid in cash and approximately 69,000 RSUs were issued with a grant date fair value of $2.6 million.

Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)

In addition to the RSU’s granted under the OPP and PPP, we grant RSUs to certain employees, generally on an annual basis. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock of the Parent and generally vests over a continued service period. The RSUs earn cash dividends during the vesting period and are, therefore, considered participating securities. We charge the value of the dividend to retained earnings. The fair value of the RSU is generally based on the market price of the Parent’s common stock on the date the award is granted and is charged to compensation expense during the vesting period, which is generally three years.

The following table summarizes the activity for RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2015 (units in thousands):

Total remaining compensation cost related to RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2015, was $34.6 million, prior to adjustments for capitalized amounts due to our development and leasing activities. The remaining compensation cost will be recognized through 2019, with a weighted average period of 1.4 years.

Operating Partnership Long-Term Incentive Plan Units

LTIP Units are valued based on the market price of the Parent’s common stock on the date the award is granted and generally vest ratably over three years. Distributions are paid with respect to the LTIP Units during the vesting period and, therefore, such LTIP Units are considered participating securities. The value of the distribution is charged to

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest

in the Operating Partnership.

The following table summarizes the activity for LTIP Units for the year ended December 31, 2015 (units in thousands):


PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Total remaining compensation cost related to LTIP Units at December 31, 2015, was $26.6 million, prior to adjustments for capitalized amounts due to our development and leasing activities. The remaining compensation cost will be recog

nized through 2018, with a weighted average period of 1.5 years.

In 2014, certain participants of the 2012 LTIP were offered the election to exchange outstanding but unvested full value awards for LTIP Units, which exchange was completed in January 2015. In addition, in 2014, certain participants were offered an election to receive grants of LTIP Units in lieu of future grants of RSUs under the 2012 LTIP and PPP. The LTIP Units issued pursuant to such elections will generally have the same vesting period and grant date fair value as the RSUs issuable under such awards.

OPP LTIP Units

As mentioned above in OPP, beginning in 2014, participants in the OPP were offered the election to exchange their previously granted participation points into OPP LTIP Units. In such election, participation points were exchanged into OPP LTIP Units with respect to outstanding performance periods. OPP LTIP Units are therefore not considered a participating security.

At December 31, 2015, the outstanding OPP LTIP Units were related to the 2014 – 2016 and 2015 – 2017 performance periods. The following table summarizes the activity for the OPP LTIP Units for the year ended December 31, 2015 (units in thousands):

Stock Options

We have 4.4 million stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2015 with a weighted average exercise price of $34.69 and a weighted average life of 3.1 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of exercised options was $13.7 million, $5.8 million, and $9.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No stock options were granted in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015.

Other Plans

The Prologis 401(k) Plan ( the “401(k) Plan”) provides for matching employer contributions of $0.50 for every dollar contributed by an employee, up to 6% of the employee’s annual compensation (within the statutory compensation limit). In the 401(k) Plan, vesting in the matching employer contributions is based on the employee’s years of service, with 100% vesting at the completion of one year of service. Our contributions under the matching provisions were $2.5 million, $2.2 million and $2.1 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

We have a non-qualified savings plan that allows highly compensated employees the opportunity to defer the receipt and income taxation of a certain portion of their compensation in excess of the amount permitted under the 401(k) Plan. There has been no employer matching in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015.

nt Income Taxes

As discussed in Note 4, contributions to our co-investment ventures were not significant during 2015, as such there was a limited impact on current income tax expense. Current income tax expense during 2014 is principally due to taxes triggered upon the contribution of the initial portfolio of properties of certain wholly-owned and AFORES entities to FIBRA Prologis. Current income tax expense during 2015 and 2014 was netted against a current benefit recognized during each year as a result of the operating losses generated by our U.S. TRS. Current income tax expense in 2013 was due to the net tax expense recognized on the initial contribution of properties to PELP and NPR that were previously held in certain foreign jurisdictions and U.S. TRSs.

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized a net expense of $3.0 million and a net benefit of $1.1 million and $1.8 million for uncertain tax positions, respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $24.1 million, $105.4 million and $99.5 million, respectively.

Deferred Income Taxes

The deferred income tax benefits recognized in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities from the contribution and dispositions of properties. The deferred tax liabilities were originally recorded at the time of acquisition. The majority of the deferred tax benefit we recognized in 2014 was due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the initial contribution of properties to FIBRA Prologis and due to the expiration of the holding period on properties previously acquired with existing built-in-gains. The deferred tax benefit in 2013 related to the contribution of properties to PELP.

The following table summarizes the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31 (in thousands):

(1)

At December 31, 2015, we had NOL carryforwards as follows (in thousands):

The deferred tax asset valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that we estimate will more likely than not be realized.

Liability for Uncertain Tax Positions

During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we believe that we have complied with the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. The statute of limitations for our tax returns is generally three years. As such, our tax returns that remain subject to examination would be primarily from 2012 and thereafter.

The liability for uncertain tax positions principally consisted of estimated federal income tax liabilities and included accrued interest and penalties of $0.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and $0.9 million at December 31, 2013. A reconciliation of the liability for uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in thousands):

Note 15. Earnings Per Common Share or Unit

We determine basic earnings per share or unit based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock or units outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings per share or unit based on the weighted average number of shares or units outstanding combined with the incremental weighted average effect from all outstanding potentially dilutive instruments.

The following table computes our basic and diluted earnings per share and unit for the years ended December 31 (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):

(1)

Earnings allocated to the exchangeable Operating Partnership units not held by the Parent have been included in the numerator and exchangeable Operating Partnership units have been included in the denominator for the purpose of computing diluted earnings per share for all periods as the per share and unit amount is the same. The incremental weighted average exchangeable Operating Partnership units were 4,671, 1,766 and 1,860 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

(2)

In March 2015, the exchangeable debt was settled primarily through the issuance of common stock. The adjustment in 2015 assumes the exchange occurred on January 1, 2015.

(3)

The increase in shares and units between the periods is primarily due to the warrant NBIM exercised in December 2014, the ATM program activity in late 2014 and early 2015 and the conversion of exchangeable debt to shares and units in March 2015.

In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into two contracts with a notional amount of $360.0 million to effectively fix the interest rate at the three month LIBOR rate of 2.3% on expected future debt issuances. These contracts were designated as interest rate forward hedges. These contracts were settled in the fourth quarter of 2015 when we entered into the $750.0 million of senior notes. We recorded a loss of $11.0 million associated with these derivatives that will be amortized to

Interest Expense

, in accordance with our policy.

(4)

During 2013, we settled 13 contracts with a notional value of $333.5 million, and contributed 13 contracts with a notional value of $383.9 million related to the transfer of assets to the newly formed PELP co-investment venture. We also settled five contracts in Japan with a notional value of $526.4 million in connection with the contributions of properties to NPR.

The following table presents the fair value of our derivative instruments at December 31 (in thousands):

(1)

During the second quarter of 2015, we terminated our euro and yen denominated net investment hedges. See below for additional information about the gains recognized upon termination.

(2)

As discussed above, these foreign currency options are not designated as hedges. We recognized gains of $22.1 million and $7.7 million in

Foreign Currency and Derivative Losses and Related Amortization, Net

from the change in value of our outstanding foreign currency option contracts for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The change in

Other Comprehensive Income

in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the periods presented is due to the translation on consolidation of the financial statements into U.S. dollars of our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar for which we recorded losses of $594.0 million, $614.8 million and $237.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. It also includes the change in fair value for the effective portion of our derivative and nonderivative instruments. The following table presents the gains and (losses) associated with the change in fair value for the effective portion of our derivative and nonderivative instruments included in

Other Comprehensive Income

for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):

)

We received $128.2 million, $13.0 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, on the settlement of net investment hedges.

(2)

The amounts reclassified to interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were not considered significant. For the next 12 months from December 31, 2015, we estimate an additional expense of $5.6 million will be reclassified to

Interest Expense

.

(3)

At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had €3.2 billion ($3.5 billion), €2.5 billion ($3.0 billion) and €700 million ($1.0 billion) of debt, net of accrued interest, respectively, designated as nonderivative financial instrument hedges of our net investment in international subsidiaries. We had €97.6 million ($118.5 million) of debt that was not designated as a nonderivative financial instrument hedge at December 31, 2014. We recognized unrealized gains of $10.0 million and $7.5 million in

Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses) and Related Amortization, Net

on the unhedged portion of our debt for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements

We have estimated the fair value of our financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that we would realize on disposition. See Note 2 for more information on our fair value measurements policy.

Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, other than the derivatives discussed previously and the embedded derivative discussed in Note 9, we did not have any significant financial assets or financial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements. All of our derivatives held at December 31, 2015 and 2014, were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.


PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Fair Value Measurements on Nonrecurring Basis

No assets met the criteria to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2015 or 2014.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses were representative of their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

The differences in the fair value of our debt from the carrying value in the table below are the result of differences in interest rates or borrowing spreads that were available to us at December 31, 2015 and 2014, as compared with those in effect when the debt was issued or assumed, including reduced borrowing spreads due to our improved credit ratings. The senior notes and many of the issues of secured mortgage debt contain pre-payment penalties or yield maintenance provisions that could make the cost of refinancing the debt at lower rates exceed the benefit that would be derived from doing so.

The following table reflects the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our debt at December 31 (in thousands):

Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies

Environmental Matters

A majority of the properties we acquire, including land, are subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners. In addition, we may incur environmental remediation costs associated with certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the development of the land. We have acquired certain properties that may have been leased to or previously owned by companies that discharged hazardous materials. We establish a liability at the time of acquisition to cover such costs and adjust the liabilities as appropriate when additional information becomes available. We record our environmental liabilities in

Other Liabilities

. We purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We are not aware of any environmental liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Indemnification Agreements

We may enter into agreements whereby we indemnify certain co-investment ventures, or our venture partners, outside of the U.S. for taxes that may be assessed with respect to certain properties we contributed to these ventures. Our contributions to these ventures are generally structured as contributions of shares of companies that own the real estate assets. Accordingly, the capital gains associated with the step up in the value of the underlying real estate assets, for tax purposes, are deferred and transferred at contribution. We have generally indemnified these ventures to the extent that the ventures: (i) incur capital gains or withholding tax as a result of a direct sale of the real estate asset, as opposed to a transaction in which the shares of the company owning the real estate asset are transferred or sold or (ii) are required to grant a discount to the buyer of shares under a share transfer transaction as a result of the ventures transferring the embedded capital gain tax liability to the buyer of the shares in the transaction. The agreements limit the amount that is subject to our indemnification with respect to each property to 100% of the actual tax liabilities related to the capital gains that are deferred and transferred by us to the ventures at the time of the initial contribution less any deferred tax assets transferred with the property.

The outcome under these agreements is uncertain as it depends on the method and timing of dissolution of the related venture or disposition of any properties by the venture. We record liabilities related to the indemnification agreements in

Other Liabilities

. We continue to monitor these agreements and the likelihood of the sale of assets that would result in recognition and will adjust the potential liability in the future as facts and circumstances dictate.

Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities

We have issued performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit in connection with certain development projects. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire on the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. At December 31, 2015, and 2014 we had approximately $58.8 million and $54.5 million, respectively, outstanding under such arrangements.

We may be required under capital commitments or we may choose to make additional capital contributions to certain of our unconsolidated entities, representing our proportionate ownership interest, should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund development or acquisition costs, repayment of debt or operation shortfalls. See Note 5 for further discussion related to equity commitments to our unconsolidated entities.

Litigation

From time to time, we are party to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that, with respect to any such matters that we are currently a party to, the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not have material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

Note 18. Business Segments

Our current business strategy includes two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital. We generate revenues, earnings, net operating income and cash flows through our segments, as follows:

·

Real Estate Operations.

This operating segment represents the ownership of industrial operating properties and is the main source of our revenue and earnings. We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. Each operating property is considered to be an individual operating segment with similar economic characteristics; these properties are combined within the reportable segment based on geographic location. Our Real Estate Operations segment also includes development, re-development and acquisition activities that lead to rental operations. We develop, redevelop and acquire industrial properties primarily in global and regional markets to meet our customers’ needs. Within this line of business, we capitalize on the following: (i) the land that we currently own; (ii) the development expertise of our local teams; (iii) our global customer relationships; and (iv) the demand for high-quality distribution facilities. Land held for development, properties currently under development and land we own and lease to customers under ground leases are included in this segment.

·

Strategic Capital.

This operating segment represents the management of unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We invest with partners and investors through our ventures, both private and public. We tailor industrial portfolios to investors’ specific needs and deploy capital with a focus on larger ventures with longer duration and open-ended funds with leading global institutions. These private and public vehicles provide capital for distinct geographies across our global platform. We hold a significant ownership interest in these ventures, which we believe aligns our interests with those of our partners. We generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures through asset management and property management services and we earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development, financing and disposition services. Depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners, we also earn revenues through promotes during the life of a venture or upon liquidation. Each unconsolidated co-investment venture we manage is considered to be an individual operating segment with similar economic characteristics; these ventures are combined within the reportable segment based on geographic location.

Reconciliations are presented below for: (i) each reportable business segment’s revenue from external customers to

Total Revenues

in the Consolidated Statements of Income; (ii) each reportable business segment’s net operating income from external customers to

Earnings Before Income Taxes

; and (iii) each reportable business segment’s assets to

Total Assets

. Our chief operating decision makers rely primarily on net operating income and similar measures to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing segment performance. The applicable components of

Total Revenues, Earnings Before Income Taxes

and

Total Assets

are allocated to each reportable business segment’s revenues, net operating income and assets. Items that are not directly assignable to a segment, such as certain corporate income and expenses, are not allocated but reflected as reconciling items. The following reconciliations are presented in thousands:
