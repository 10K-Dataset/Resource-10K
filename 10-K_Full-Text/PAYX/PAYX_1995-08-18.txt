Item 1.  Business.
         ---------

General

Paychex, Inc. (the "Company" or "Paychex"), a Delaware corporation, was
formed in 1979 through the consolidation of 17 corporations engaged in
providing computerized payroll accounting services.

Principal Products, Services and Markets.
-----------------------------------------

Paychex is primarily engaged in providing computerized payroll accounting
services to approximately 208,000 small to medium sized businesses
nationwide.  Paychex believes that in number of clients it is the second
largest payroll accounting service company in the country.  The Company
prepares and furnishes paychecks, earnings statements and internal
accounting records such as journals, summaries and earnings histories.
Paychex prepares for its clients all required monthly, quarterly and
annual payroll tax returns for federal, state and local governments.  The
TAXPAY  feature is utilized by over 50% of its' clients nationwide.
This service provides automatic payment of payroll taxes and filing of
quarterly and annual tax returns.  Paychex also provides enhanced payroll
services, including an automatic salary deposit service (Direct Deposit)
which electronically transmits the net payroll for client's employees to
banks throughout the Federal Reserve System.  In addition, a digital check
signing and inserting service is offered.

Paychex markets its services principally to small and medium sized
businesses through its 71 branch operating centers and 23 sales offices
located in major metropolitan areas.  The Company's market share in branch
processing center territories ranges from 1% to approximately 20%.  No
client accounts for as much as 1% of the Company's revenue.

Clients may discontinue Paychex service at will.  Approximately 80% of the
businesses which were clients in fiscal year 1993 or 1994 continued to be
clients in the succeeding fiscal year.  Ownership changes or business
failures common to small businesses are the primary causes of client loss.

The Company warrants its services, agreeing to reimburse any client for
penalties and interest incurred as a result of a Paychex error.  Warranty
expense paid in fiscal years 1994 and 1995 was approximately $160,000 and
$410,000, respectively.

The Company employs payroll specialists who communicate primarily by
telephone with their assigned clients each payroll period to record the
hours worked by each employee and any personnel or compensation changes.
These specialists are trained by Paychex in all facets of payroll
preparation and applicable tax regulations. All information furnished by a
client is handled by someone who is "payroll intelligent" and familiar
with that client's payroll.

The Paychex payroll system is an on-line, direct entry computer system which
enables the payroll specialist to simultaneously enter information from the
client over the telephone.  Payroll processing is decentralized in each of the
Company's branch operating centers while Taxpay and Direct Deposit processing
are centralized at the Company's headquarters.  Sales offices utilize a nearby
Company branch operating center for processing.

During 1993, the Company introduced Paylink, a proprietary software
package which enables clients to use their personal computers and modems
to transmit their own payroll data into the local Paychex processing
center at any time without assistance of a payroll specialist.  This
product is available in all branch processing centers.  Currently over
11,000 clients use this feature.

While payroll is its core business, Paychex also provides human resource
products and services through its HRS division.

HRS markets Cafeteria Plan products approved under Section 125 of the
Internal Revenue Code.  The Premium Only Plan allows employees to pay for
certain fringe benefits with pre-tax dollars, with a resultant reduction
of payroll taxes to employers and employees.  The Flexible Spending
Account Plan allows client employees to pay for health and dependent care
expenses with pre-tax dollars.  All administration, compliance and
coverage tests are provided with these services.

The HRS Division's employee management services and products include
customized employee handbooks, management manuals, job descriptions and
personnel forms.   These have been designed to simplify clients' office
processes and enhance their employee benefits programs.  Also available is
a measurement and evaluation tool to assist clients in the process of
hiring, training and developing employees and group insurance products
offered in selected geographical areas.

During 1995, the HRS Division introduced a 401(K) Recordkeeping Service to
selected markets.  This service provides plan design and implementation,
ongoing compliance with government regulations, employee and employer
reporting and other administrative services.

Products and services of the HRS Division are sold through a separate
sales organization located in most branch offices.  Some of the products
and services are available on a nationwide basis through an inside sales
group.

Software Maintenance and Product Development.
---------------------------------------------

The ever-changing mandates of Federal, State and local taxing authorities
compel the Company to continuously update its proprietary software. The
Company is also engaged in developing ongoing enhancements to its software
to meet the changing requirements of its clients and the marketplace.
However, the Company is not engaged, to any significant extent, in basic
software research and development.

Competition.
------------
The payroll accounting services industry is characterized by intense
competition.  The principal competitive factors are price and service.
Paychex believes it has one major competitor that provides computerized
payroll accounting services nationwide.  Although this competitor has
historically concentrated on larger employers, it has for several years
marketed directly to the small and medium sized businesses which
constitute the Paychex market.  In addition, the Company competes with
other providers of computerized payroll services, including banks and
smaller independent firms.

The Company's principal competition, used by a majority of the businesses
in its market, is manual payroll systems sold by numerous vendors.  Some
companies have in-house computer capability to generate their own payroll
documents and reports.

Executive Officers.
-------------------
The information required is set forth in the Company's Proxy Statement and
is incorporated herein by reference.

Employees.
----------
Paychex currently employs approximately 3,500 persons, of which 3,300 are
full time and 200 are part time.

Trademarks.
-----------
The Company has a number of trademarks registered in the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office including the names PAYCHEX, TAXPAY and PAYLINK.  The
Company believes these trademarks are of material importance to its
business.

Seasonality.
------------
There is no significant seasonality to the Company's business, except that
over  30% of new clients added in each of the last two fiscal years have
been added during the third fiscal quarter.  Consequently, greater sales
commissions are paid in that quarter, resulting in higher selling expenses
for the third quarter.  These expenses, along with additional labor costs
for calendar year-end processing of payroll reports and returns, have
traditionally resulted in lower operating profits for the third quarter as
compared to other quarters.

Item 2.  Properties.
         -----------
The corporate headquarters, owned by the Company, occupy a 139,000 square
foot office complex in a suburb of Rochester, New York.  The Company owns
and occupies a 62,000 square foot distribution and office facility located
within 10 miles of corporate headquarters.  The Company also owns a 20,000
square foot office facility in Syracuse, New York. Approximately one-half
of this building is occupied by the Syracuse branch office and the
remaining space is leased.  In June, 1995, the Company acquired a 38,000
square foot building (on leased land) as part of the Company's acquisition
of Pay-Fone Systems, Inc., a payroll company located in Van Nuys,
California.  Pay-Fone Systems, Inc. occupies approximately two-thirds of
the building and the remaining space is leased.

The Company leases office space for its branch and sales offices at
various locations throughout the country.  On average, branch offices
contain approximately 9,000 square feet and sales offices approximately
650 square feet.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.
         ------------------

There are no material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
         ----------------------------------------------------

No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year ended May 31, 1995.
