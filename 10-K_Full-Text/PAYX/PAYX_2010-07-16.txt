PART I

“SAFE
    HARBOR” STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION
    REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain written and oral statements made by management of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“we,”
    “our,” “us,” “Paychex,” or the
    “Company”) may constitute “forward-looking
    statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995 (the “Reform Act”). Forward-looking
    statements are identified by such words and phrases as “we
    expect,” “expected to,” “estimates,”
    “estimated,” “current outlook,” “we
    look forward to,” “would equate to,”
    “projects,” “projections,” “projected
    to be,” “anticipates,” “anticipated,”
    “we believe,” “could be,” and other similar
    phrases. All statements addressing operating performance,
    events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur
    in the future, including statements relating to revenue growth,
    earnings, earnings-per-share growth, or similar projections, are
    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act.
    Because they are forward-looking, they should be evaluated in
    light of important risk factors. These risk factors include, but
    are not limited to, the following risks as well as those
    described in “Risk Factors” under Item 1A and
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Form 10-K”):

•

general market and economic conditions including, among others,
    changes in United States (“U.S.”) employment and wage
    levels, changes in new hiring trends, legislative changes to
    stimulate the economy, changes in short- and long-term interest
    rates, changes in the fair value and the credit rating of
    securities held by us, and accessibility of financing;

•

changes in demand for our services and products, ability to
    develop and market new services and products effectively,
    pricing changes and the impact of competition, and the
    availability of skilled workers;

•

changes in the laws regulating collection and payment of payroll
    taxes, professional employer organizations, and employee
    benefits, including retirement plans, workers’
    compensation, health insurance, state unemployment, and
    section 125 plans;

•

changes in workers’ compensation rates and underlying
    claims trends;

•

the possibility of failure to keep pace with technological
    changes and provide timely enhancements to services and products;

•

the possibility of failure of our operating facilities, computer
    systems, and communication systems during a catastrophic event;

•

the possibility of third-party service providers failing to
    perform their functions;

•

the possible failure of internal controls or our inability to
    implement business processing improvements; and

•

potentially unfavorable outcomes related to pending legal
    matters.

Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from our anticipated results. The information
    provided in this

Form 10-K

is based upon the facts and circumstances known at this time. We
    undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking
    statements after the date of filing of this

Form 10-K

with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
    “Commission”) to reflect events or circumstances after
    such date, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Item 1.

Business

We are a leading provider of payroll, human resource, and
    benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized
    businesses. As of May 31, 2010, we serviced approximately
    536,000 clients and had approximately 12,200 employees. We
    maintain our corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and
    have more than 100 offices nationwide.

As of May 31, 2010, we serviced approximately 1,700 clients
    in Germany through four offices.

Our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in 1979. We
    report our results of operations and financial condition as one
    business segment. Our fiscal year ends May 31.



Company
    Strategy

We are focused on achieving strong, long-term financial
    performance by:

•

providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable
    comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource services;

•

delivering these services utilizing a well-trained and
    responsive work force through a network of local and corporate
    offices servicing more than 100 of the largest markets in the
    U.S.;

•

growing our client base, primarily through the efforts of our
    direct sales force;

•

continually improving client service to maximize client
    retention;

•

capitalizing on the growth opportunities within our existing
    client base and from new clients by increasing utilization of
    our payroll and human resource ancillary services and products;

•

capitalizing on and leveraging our highly developed
    technological and operating infrastructure;

•

investing in our business through expansion of our service and
    product offerings to continually add value for our
    clients; and

•

supplementing our growth through strategic acquisitions when
    appropriate opportunities arise.

Services
    and Products

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services and products that
    allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human
    resource needs. These include:

•

payroll processing;

•

payroll tax administration services;

•

employee payment services;

•

regulatory compliance services (new-hire reporting and
    garnishment processing);

•

Paychex HR Solutions;

•

retirement services administration;

•

insurance services;

•

eServices; and

•

other human resource services and products.

By offering ancillary services that leverage the information
    gathered in the base payroll processing service, we are able to
    provide comprehensive outsourcing services that allow employers
    to expand their employee benefits offerings at an affordable
    cost. We mainly earn our revenue through recurring fees for
    services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the
    number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay
    period, and utilization of ancillary services.

Payroll

Payroll processing is the foundation of our service portfolio.
    Our payroll service includes the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; preparation of
    federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
    and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations. Our payroll
    services are provided through either our core payroll or Major
    Market Services (“MMS”) and are made available to
    clients via traditional or Internet-based methods.

Paychex Online is our secure Internet site, which offers core
    payroll clients a suite of self-service, interactive services
    and products twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. These
    include Paychex Online
    Payroll

®

,

    Internet Time Sheet, Paychex Online Reports, and General Ledger
    Reporting Service. Using these services, clients can



communicate payroll information, access current and historical
    payroll information, and transfer payroll information calculated
    by us to their general ledger accounting software, eliminating
    manual entries and improving the accuracy of bookkeeping. More
    than one-half of our clients are currently utilizing some form
    of Paychex Online payroll service.

Major Market Services:

MMS primarily
    targets companies that have more sophisticated payroll and
    benefits needs. We currently offer this service in all of our
    significant markets. Our proprietary MMS software,
    Preview

®

,

    provides a powerful payroll solution and allows smooth
    integration with other Paychex service offerings. Preview can be
    used as an

on-site,

PC-based system or via a secure web-hosted environment.

We offer a software-as-a-service solution to meet the payroll
    and human resource administrative needs of our MMS clients. This
    allows Preview to be integrated with various Internet-based
    services offered to assist clients with their administrative
    human resource and payroll needs through every step of the
    employee life cycle. Ancillary services particularly beneficial
    to our MMS clients include the following:

•

Paychex HR Online, our Internet-based human resource management
    system, offers powerful tools for managing employee benefits,
    personnel information, and critical human resource compliance
    and reporting needs. In addition, its self-service features
    allow for better communication between management and employees.

•

BeneTrac, our employee benefits management and administration
    system, provides our MMS clients a simple, accurate, and
    cost-effective solution for streamlined benefits management.

•

Paychex Time and Labor Online makes the time and attendance
    process more efficient. This solution can reduce time spent on
    preparing timesheets, minimize redundant data entry, increase
    awareness of critical labor information, and aid in compliance
    with federal time recording requirements.

•

Paychex Expense Manager is an integrated payroll and expense
    management solution that allows clients to control discretionary
    spending while giving employees an easy-to-use, secure tool to
    prepare and submit expense reports online.

•

Applicant tracking, offered through our partnership with Taleo
    Corporation, provides our MMS clients with a tool to manage
    their recruiting process in order to better hire and retain
    talented employees.

MMS clients can select Paychex One-Source Solutions, which
    seamlessly integrates Preview, Paychex Time and Labor Online,
    and Paychex HR Online applications through a single, web-based
    client portal. MMS clients also have the option to select from a
    number of á la carte payroll and human resource ancillary
    services or opt for our comprehensive human resource and payroll
    outsourcing solution, Paychex HR Solutions. This flexibility
    allows our clients to define the solution that best meets their
    particular needs.

Payroll tax administration services:

As
    of May 31, 2010, 94% of our clients utilized our payroll
    tax administration services (including
    Taxpay

®

),

    which provide accurate preparation and timely filing of
    quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic
    transfer of funds to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies
    (federal, state, and local). Nearly all of our new clients
    purchase our payroll tax administration services. In connection
    with these services, we electronically collect payroll taxes
    from clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare
    and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due
    dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and
    30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with
    some items extending to 90 days. We handle regulatory
    correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes,
    and we are subject to cash penalties imposed by tax or
    regulatory agencies for late filings and late or under payment
    of taxes.

Employee payment services:

As of
    May 31, 2010, 77% of our clients utilized our employee
    payment services, which provide the employer the option of
    paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a
    check drawn on a Paychex account
    (Readychex

®

),

    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by us. More than 80% of new clients select
    some form of employee payment services. For the first three
    methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the
    clients’ bank account, typically one business day before
    payday, and provide payment to the employee on payday. Our
    flexible payment options provide a cost-effective solution that
    offers the benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account
    reconciliation for employers.



Regulatory compliance services:

We
    offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to
    comply with federal and state requirements to report information
    on newly hired employees. This information aids the government
    in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent
    unemployment and workers’ compensation insurance claims.
    Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from
    employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies,
    including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the
    obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to
    comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties.

Human
    Resource Services

Paychex HR Solutions:

We offer
    comprehensive human resource outsourcing solutions that provide
    businesses a full-service approach to the outsourcing of
    employer and employee administrative needs. Our Paychex HR
    Solutions offering is available as an administrative services
    organization (“ASO”), previously known as Paychex
    Premier

®

Human Resources, and a professional employer organization
    (“PEO”). Both options offer businesses a combined
    package of services that includes payroll, employer compliance,
    human resource and employee benefits administration, risk
    management outsourcing, and the

on-site

availability of a professionally trained human resource
    representative. These comprehensive bundles of services are
    designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
    payroll and related benefit costs while providing a benefits
    package equal to that of larger companies. Our PEO differs from
    the ASO in that we serve as a co-employer of the clients’
    employees, assume the risks and rewards of workers’
    compensation insurance, and provide more sophisticated health
    care offerings to PEO clients. PEO services continue to be sold
    through our registered and licensed subsidiary, Paychex Business
    Solutions, Inc. The integration of the sales and service models
    of the ASO and PEO under Paychex HR Solutions has reduced
    redundancies and created more flexible options for businesses
    owners to find the solution that best meets their needs. As of
    May 31, 2010, Paychex HR Solutions were utilized by 19,000
    clients with approximately 502,000 client employees.

Retirement services administration:

Our
    retirement services product line offers a variety of options to
    clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE, SIMPLE IRA,
    401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, profit sharing, and
    money purchase plans. These services provide plan
    implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations,
    employee and employer reporting, participant and employer online
    access, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative
    services. Auto enrollment is an optional plan feature allowing
    employers to automatically enroll employees in their
    company’s 401(k) plan and increase overall plan
    participation. Clients have the ability to choose from a group
    of pre-defined fund selections or to customize their investment
    options within their plan. Selling efforts for these services
    are focused primarily on our existing payroll client base, as
    the processed payroll information allows for data integration
    necessary to provide these services efficiently. We are one of
    the largest 401(k) recordkeepers for small businesses in the
    U.S. We earn a fee of approximately twenty-five basis
    points from the external fund managers based on the total asset
    value of client employee 401(k) funds. As of May 31, 2010,
    retirement services were utilized by approximately 51,000
    clients and the asset value of client employee 401(k) funds
    externally managed totaled approximately $11.3 billion.

Insurance services:

Our licensed
    insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., provides
    insurance through a variety of carriers. Insurance offerings
    include property and casualty coverage such as workers’
    compensation; business-owner policies; commercial auto; and
    health and benefits coverage including health, dental, vision,
    and life. Our insurance services simplify the insurance process
    to make it easy to find plans with the features and
    affordability to meet the client’s needs. With access to
    over 150 of the top national and regional carriers, our
    professional insurance agents enjoy a wide selection of plans
    from which to best match the insurance needs of small business.
    Clients also have the option to integrate with Paychex payroll
    processing for easy, accurate plan administration. Paychex
    Insurance Agency has a website,

www.paychexinsurance.com

,
    with information and interactive tools to help educate visitors
    on insurance and aid in making business insurance decisions. As
    of May 31, 2010, approximately 92,000 clients have
    appointed Paychex Insurance Agency as their agent for servicing
    their business insurance needs.

eServices:

We offer online human
    resource administration software products for employee benefits
    management and administration and time and attendance solutions.
    Paychex HR Online offers powerful tools for managing employee
    benefits, personnel information, and human resource compliance
    and reporting. Time and



Labor Online helps minimize the time spent compiling time sheet
    information. It allows the employer to handle multiple payroll
    scenarios and results in improved productivity, accuracy, and
    reliability in the payroll process.

Other human resource services and
    products:

We offer the outsourcing of plan
    administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for
    certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care
    expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation,
    administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement,
    and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer
    state unemployment insurance services, which provide clients
    with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations,
    change statements, and requests for separation documents. Other
    Human Resource Services products include employee handbooks,
    management manuals, and personnel and required regulatory forms.
    These products are designed to simplify clients’ office
    processes and enhance their employee benefits programs.

Sales and
    Marketing

We market our services primarily through our direct sales force
    based in the metropolitan markets we serve, with sales
    representatives specializing within our portfolio of services.
    For the year ending May 31, 2011 (“fiscal 2011”),
    our sales force is expected to total approximately 2,380
    representatives. Our sales representatives are also supported by
    marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and
    telemarketing programs. We have grown and expect to continue to
    grow our direct sales force. In recent years, we have increased
    our emphasis on the selling of ancillary services and products
    to both new clients and our existing client base.

In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we
    utilize relationships with existing clients, certified public
    accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client
    referrals. More than 60% of our new core payroll clients
    (excluding acquisitions) come from these referral sources. To
    further enhance our strong relationship with CPAs, we have
    partnered with the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll
    provider for its AICPA Business Solutions Partner Program since
    2003.

Our website at

www.paychex.com

, which includes online
    payroll sales presentations and service and product information,
    is a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of leads and
    new sales while complementing the efforts of our direct sales
    force. This online tool allows us to market to clients in more
    geographically remote areas. In addition, our insurance services
    website at

www.paychexinsurance.com

provides information
    to help small businesses navigate the insurance industry, and
    generates leads by allowing interested parties to get in contact
    with a one of our professional insurance agents.

In addition, Advantage Payroll Services Inc.
    (“Advantage”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex,
    Inc., has license agreements with independently owned associate
    offices (“Associates”), which are responsible for
    selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing
    certain operational functions, while Paychex and Advantage
    provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and
    payroll tax administration services. The marketing and selling
    by the Associates is conducted under their own logos.

Markets
    and Competition

Industry data indicates there are approximately ten million
    employers in the geographic markets that we currently serve
    within the U.S. Of those employers, approximately 99% have
    fewer than 100 employees and are our primary customers and
    target market. We remain focused on servicing small- to
    medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we
    believe exists in this market segment.

We serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients
    operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the
    U.S. As of May 31, 2010, we serviced approximately
    536,000 clients. We utilize service agreements and arrangements
    with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any
    time or upon relatively short notice. For the fiscal year ended
    May 31, 2010 (“fiscal 2010”), client retention
    was approximately 77% of our beginning of the fiscal year client
    base. While this is relatively consistent with the prior year,
    we have begun to see some signs of improvement, as clients lost
    in fiscal 2010 decreased 6% compared to the fiscal year ended
    May 31, 2009 (“fiscal 2009”). No single client
    has a material impact on total service revenue or results of
    operations.

Based on currently available market data from Dun &

The market for payroll processing and human resource services is
    highly competitive and fragmented. We believe our primary
    national competitor,
    ADP

®

(“Automatic Data Processing, Inc.”), is the largest
    U.S. third-party provider of payroll processing and human
    resource services in terms of revenue. We compete with other
    national, regional, local, and online service providers, all of
    which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us.

In addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource
    service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and human
    resource systems and departments. Payroll and human resource
    systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our Human
    Resource Services also compete with a variety of providers of
    human resource services, such as retirement services companies,
    insurance companies, and human resources and benefits consulting
    firms.

Competition in the payroll processing and human resource
    services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness,
    product quality and reputation, breadth of service and product
    offering, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of
    these areas.

Software
    Maintenance and Development

The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and
    regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the
    proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human
    resource services to our clients. We are continually engaged in
    developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various
    software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our
    clients and the marketplace.

In fiscal 2010, we completed implementation of an enhanced
    platform for our core processing capability, which allows us to
    leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide
    excellent customer service. Over the next few years, we expect
    to expand this platform to additional service offerings.

Employees

As of May 31, 2010, we employed approximately
    12,200 people. None of our employees were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements.

Intellectual
    Property

We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names,
    copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and
    software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a
    whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the
    conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be
    appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual
    property rights, including, but not limited to,
    confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with
    employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with
    licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and
    registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the
    “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material
    importance to us.

Seasonality

There is no significant seasonality to our business. However,
    during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the
    number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients,
    and new Paychex HR Solutions worksite employees tends to be
    higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily
    because a majority of new



clients begin using our services in the beginning of a calendar
    year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and
    client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third
    fiscal quarter due to clients paying year-end bonuses and
    requesting additional year-end services. Historically, as a
    result of these factors, our total revenue has been slightly
    higher in the third fiscal quarter, with greater sales
    commission expenses also reported in this quarter.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our future results of operations are subject to a number of
    risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could
    cause actual results to differ materially from historical and
    current results and from our projections. Important factors
    known to us that could cause such differences include, but are
    not limited to, those discussed below and those contained in the
    “Safe Harbor” statement at the beginning of
    Part I of this

Form 10-K.

We may be adversely impacted by volatility in the
    financial and economic environment:

During
    periods of weakening economic conditions, employment levels may
    decrease and interest rates may become more volatile. These
    conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction
    volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of
    business. Current or potential clients may decide to reduce
    their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services. In
    addition, new business starts may be affected by an inability to
    obtain credit. The interest we earn on funds held for clients
    may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to
    invest and lower interest rates. In addition, during periods of
    volatility in the credit markets, certain types of investments
    may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to
    invest in, further reducing the interest we may earn on client
    funds. Constriction in the credit markets may impact the
    availability of financing, even to borrowers with the highest
    credit ratings. We historically have not borrowed against
    available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs. However,
    should we require additional short-term liquidity during days of
    large outflows of client funds, a credit constriction may limit
    our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain
    them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us. If all of
    these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in
    effect for an extended period of time, there could be a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our interest earned on funds held for clients may be
    impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the
    amount of tax withheld or timing of
    remittance:

We receive interest income from
    investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. A
    change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to
    be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable
    tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest
    income.

Our services may be adversely impacted by changes in
    government regulations and policies:

Many of
    our services, particularly payroll tax administration services
    and employee benefit plan administration services, are designed
    according to government regulations that continually change.
    Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of
    benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide
    employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and
    employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or
    eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially
    decrease our revenue. Added requirements could also increase our
    cost of doing business. The recently enacted Hiring Incentives
    to Restore Employment (“HIRE”) Act provides temporary
    tax breaks to companies that hire the unemployed and will impact
    our payroll tax administration service clients. The recently
    enacted health care reform legislation will have a direct impact
    on insurance services clients. Failure to educate and assist our
    client regarding these legislations could have an adverse impact
    on our reputation. Failure by



us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to
    regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our
    business and results of operations.

We may not be able to keep pace with changes in
    technology:

To maintain our growth strategy,
    we must adapt and respond to technological advances and
    technological requirements of our clients. Our future success
    will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase
    the performance of our internal use systems, particularly our
    systems that meet our clients’ requirements. We continue to
    make significant investments related to the development of new
    technology. If our systems become outdated, we may be at a
    disadvantage when competing in our industry. There can be no
    assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will
    be successful. If we do not integrate and update our systems in
    a timely manner, or if our investments in technology fail to
    provide the expected results, there could be a material adverse
    effect to our business and results of operations.

In the event of a catastrophe, our business continuity
    plan may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and
    adversely interrupt operations:

Our
    operations are dependent on our ability to protect our
    infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural
    disaster, severe weather including events resulting from climate
    change, unauthorized security breach, power loss,
    telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, or other events
    that could have a significant disruptive effect on our
    operations. We have a business continuity plan in place in the
    event of system failure due to any of these events. Our business
    continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of
    severe weather, including floods and snowstorms, and has been
    successful. However, these past successes are not an indicator
    of success in the future. If the business continuity plan is
    unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could
    potentially lose client data or experience material adverse
    interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our
    clients.

We may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party
    service providers to perform their
    functions:

As part of providing services to
    clients, we rely on a number of third-party service providers.
    These service providers include, but are not limited to,
    couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to
    electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees.
    Failure by these service providers, for any reason, to deliver
    their services in a timely manner could result in material
    interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and
    result in significant penalties or liabilities to us.

Our business and reputation may be affected by our ability
    to keep clients’ information
    confidential:

Our business involves the use
    of significant amounts of private and confidential client
    information including employees’ identification numbers,
    bank accounts, and retirement account information. This
    information is critical to the accurate and timely provision of
    services to our clients, and certain information may be
    transmitted via the Internet. There is no guarantee that our
    systems and processes are adequate to protect against all
    security breaches. If our systems are disrupted or fail for any
    reason, or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized
    persons, our clients could experience data loss, financial loss,
    harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. Such
    events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation,
    regulation investigation and penalties, loss of clients’
    business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, and there
    could be a material adverse effect on our business and results
    of operations.

We may be exposed to additional risks related to our
    co-employment relationship within our PEO
    business:

Many federal and state laws that
    apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically
    address the obligations and responsibilities of the
    “co-employment” relationship. As a result, there is a
    possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations
    of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or
    omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our
    agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or
    violations. Although our agreements with the clients provide
    that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable
    to its own or its employees’ conduct, we may not be able to
    effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. In
    addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our
    employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the
    “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws.

We may have an adverse outcome of legal matters, which
    could harm our business:

We are subject to
    various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course
    of business. These include disputes or potential disputes
    related to breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty,
    employment-related claims, tax claims, and other matters. Refer
    to Item 3 of this

Form 10-K

for additional disclosure regarding legal proceedings. Legal
    matters are



subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the
    possibility that their ultimate resolution could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position and results of
    operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

    various locations throughout the U.S. and Germany and house
    our regional, branch, and sales offices and data processing
    centers. These locations are concentrated in metropolitan areas.
    We believe that adequate, suitable lease space will continue to
    be available for our needs.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in
    the normal course of our business. These include disputes or
    potential disputes related to breach of contract, breach of
    fiduciary duty, employment-related claims, tax claims, and other
    matters.

In August 2001, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,
    Rapid Payroll, Inc. (“Rapid Payroll”) informed
    76 licensees that it intended to stop supporting their
    payroll processing software in August of 2002. The communication
    was sent due to the licensee contract assumed by us during the
    acquisition of Rapid Payroll in 1996 being very unfavorable to
    us. Thereafter, lawsuits were commenced by licensees asserting
    various claims, including breach of contract and related tort
    and fraud causes of action.

On March 9, 2010, the Court of Appeal of the State of
    California upheld a jury verdict issued on June 27, 2007 in
    litigation brought by one of the licensees. In that case, the
    California Superior Court, Los Angeles County jury awarded to
    the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory damages and
    subsequently awarded an additional $11.0 million in
    punitive damages. We satisfied the judgment, including statutory
    interest, without further appeal. This was the final pending
    matter in the Rapid Payroll litigation.

During fiscal 2010, we increased our litigation reserve by
    $18.7 million for the Rapid Payroll litigation. Our
    management currently believes that resolution of outstanding
    legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position or results of operations. However, legal
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists
    the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters
    could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
    financial position and the results of operations in the period
    in which any such effect is recorded.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations reviews the operating results of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
    (“Paychex,” “we,” “our,” or
    “us”) for each of the three fiscal years ended
    May 31, 2010 (“fiscal 2010”), May 31, 2009
    (“fiscal 2009”), and May 31, 2008 (“fiscal
    2008”), and our financial condition as of May 31,
    2010. This review should be read in conjunction with the
    accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the related
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Form 10-K”)

and the “Risk Factors” discussed in Item 1A of
    this

Form 10-K.

Forward-looking statements in this review are qualified by the
    cautionary statement under the heading “Safe Harbor
    Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995” contained at the beginning of Part I of this

Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a leading provider of payroll, human resource, and
    benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized
    businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a
    portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to
    meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs. Our payroll
    services are the foundation of our service portfolio. They are
    provided through either our core payroll or Major Market
    Services (“MMS”), which is utilized by clients that
    have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs, and include:

•

payroll processing;

•

payroll tax administration services;

•

employee payment services; and

•

regulatory compliance services (new-hire reporting and
    garnishment processing).



In addition to the above, our software-as-a-service option
    through our MMS platform provides human resource management,
    employee benefits management, time and attendance systems,
    online expense reporting, and applicant tracking.

Our Human Resource Services primarily include:

•

Paychex HR Solutions, under which we offer our administrative
    services organization (“ASO”) and our professional
    employer organization (“PEO”);

•

retirement services administration;

•

insurance services;

•

eServices; and

•

other human resource services and products.

We mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services
    performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of
    clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and
    utilization of ancillary services. We also earn interest on
    funds held for clients between the time of collection from our
    clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. Our business strategy is focused
    on achieving strong long-term financial performance by providing
    high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services; growing
    our client base; increasing utilization of our ancillary
    services; leveraging our technological and operating
    infrastructure; and expanding our service offerings.

Our financial results for fiscal 2010 were impacted by the
    cumulative adverse effects of the economic recession in the
    United States (“U.S.”) and global financial crisis
    that began in 2008. Unemployment rates in the U.S. reached
    a high in October 2009, and have remained high. The equity
    markets hit a low in March 2009, with interest rates available
    on high quality instruments remaining low since then. The
    Federal Funds rate has been at a range of zero to 0.25% since
    December 2008. Our combined funds held for clients and corporate
    investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.5%
    for fiscal 2010, compared to 2.1% for fiscal 2009 and 3.7% for
    fiscal 2008.

The weak economy affects our ability to acquire and retain
    clients, reduces our transaction volumes related to fewer
    employees in our client base, and results in lower average
    invested balances in our funds held for clients portfolio. Our
    results, while reflecting a decline compared to fiscal 2009,
    were in line with our expectations. Although the economy has
    remained weak throughout fiscal 2010, our key indicators have
    reflected modest improvement as the fiscal year progressed.

Highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2010 compared to
    fiscal 2009 are as follows:

•

Payroll service revenue decreased 5% to $1.4 billion.

•

Human Resource Services revenue increased 3% to
    $540.9 million.

•

Interest on funds held for clients decreased 27% to
    $55.0 million.

•

Total revenue decreased 4% to $2.0 billion.

•

Operating income decreased 10% to $724.8 million, and
    operating income, net of certain items, decreased 6% to
    $688.5 million. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial
    Measure” discussion on page 14 for further information
    on operating income, net of certain items.

•

Operating income reflected an expense charge of
    $18.7 million to increase the litigation reserve for the
    Rapid Payroll court decision during the third quarter of fiscal
    2010, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 per
    share.

•

Net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 11% to
    $477.0 million and $1.32 per share, respectively.



•

Cash flow from operations decreased 11% to $610.9 million,
    primarily related to the decline in net income and fluctuations
    in operating assets and liabilities.

•

Dividends of $448.6 million were paid to stockholders,
    representing 94% of net income.

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measure

In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) measure, we
    present operating income, net of certain items, which is a
    non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain
    items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an
    indicator of our core business operations performance period
    over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally
    for establishing the following year’s targets and measuring
    management’s performance in connection with certain
    performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating
    income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held
    for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase
    the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an
    adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest
    rates, which are not within the control of management. The
    expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an
    adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent
    nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and
    obscures the comparability of performance period over period.
    Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated
    through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of
    disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”). As such, it should not be considered as a
    substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and,
    therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction
    with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may
    produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be
    comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other
    companies. Operating income, net of certain items, decreased 6%
    to $688.5 million for fiscal 2010 compared to
    $729.7 million for fiscal 2009 and $696.5 million for
    fiscal 2008.

Business
    Outlook

Our client base was approximately 536,000 clients as of
    May 31, 2010, compared to approximately 554,000 clients as
    of May 31, 2009, and approximately 572,000 clients as of
    May 31, 2008. Our client base declined 3.2% for fiscal
    2010, compared to a decline of 3.1% for fiscal 2009 and growth
    of 2.0% for fiscal 2008. The reduction in our client base for
    fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of weaker economic conditions on
    our ability to acquire and retain clients. The environment for
    new sales remained difficult and new sales units decreased 4.9%
    for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of low
    levels of new business formation and fewer companies moving to
    outsourcing.

For fiscal 2010, client retention was approximately 77% of our
    beginning of the fiscal year client base. While this was
    relatively consistent with the prior year, we have begun to see
    some signs of improvement, as clients lost in fiscal 2010
    decreased 6% compared to fiscal 2009. Clients lost due to
    companies going out of business or no longer having any
    employees decreased 11% for fiscal 2010, compared to an increase
    of 17% for fiscal 2009. We focus on satisfying customers to
    maximize client retention, and for fiscal 2010 we again received
    high client satisfaction results.

Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data
    and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. Although
    the growth rates for our ancillary services for fiscal 2010 were
    slower than we have seen



historically due to the impacts of the weak economy, we continue
    to see opportunities within these services. The following
    statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service

Continued investment in our business is critical to our success.
    In fiscal 2010, we made investments in our sales force and in
    our technological infrastructure. Our sales force increased 2%
    to 2,340 sales representatives for fiscal 2010, and is expected
    to grow 2% to 2,380 sales representatives for the fiscal year
    ending May 31, 2011 (“fiscal 2011”). This growth
    is driven primarily by increases in insurance services and other
    Human Resource Services offerings.

We have invested over $60 million in an enhanced platform
    for our core payroll processing capability, which was fully
    implemented in fiscal 2010. This new platform allows us to
    leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide
    excellent customer service to our clients. Over the next few
    years, we expect to expand our enhanced platform to additional
    service offerings.

We continued expansion of our insurance services nationwide,
    simplifying the process for our clients to obtain coverage
    through our network of national and regional insurers. We see
    our insurance services as an area that continues to offer
    significant opportunities for future growth.

We also strengthened our position as an expert in our industry
    by serving as a source of education and information to clients
    and other interested parties. The new Paychex Insurance Agency
    website,

www.paychexinsurance.com

, helps small business
    owners navigate the area of insurance coverage. In addition, we
    provide information for existing and prospective clients on the
    impacts of regulatory changes, such as the Hiring Incentives to
    Restore Employment (“HIRE”) Act and the recently
    passed federal health care reform bill.

Our ASO and PEO are now being offered under Paychex HR
    Solutions. We integrated the sales and service model to support
    and expand our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services
    nationwide. This allowed us to eliminate redundancies, and
    create more flexible options for potential clients. PEO services
    will continue to be sold by the registered and licensed Paychex
    Business Solutions, Inc. and its affiliates.

Looking to the future, we continue to focus on investing in our
    products, people, and service capabilities. This will position
    us to capitalize on opportunities for long term growth.

Financial
    position and liquidity

The current credit crisis has resulted in unprecedented
    volatility in the global financial markets, which has curtailed
    available liquidity and limited investment choices. Despite this
    macroeconomic environment, as of May 31, 2010, our
    financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate
    investments of $656.9 million and no debt.

We continue to follow our conservative investment strategy of
    optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. In the past
    twenty months, this has translated to significantly lower yields
    on high quality instruments, negatively impacting our income
    earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments.
    Since September 2008, our primary short-term investment vehicle
    has been U.S. agency discount notes. Since then, we have
    seen gradual improvement in liquidity in certain money market
    sectors, and starting in November 2009 we began to invest in
    select

A-1/P-1-rated

variable rate demand notes (“VRDNs”). During fiscal
    2010, we earned an after-tax rate of approximately 0.21% for
    VRDNs compared to approximately 0.07% for U.S. agency
    discount notes. We invest primarily in high credit quality
    securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities
    with

A-1/P-1

ratings.



We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer.
    As of May 31, 2010, we had no exposure to British Petroleum
    (BP) or any of its subsidiaries. We believe that our investments
    as of May 31, 2010 were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date
    that would indicate any

other-than-temporary

impairment. All investments held as of May 31, 2010 are
    traded in active markets.

Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow
    from operations was $610.9 million for fiscal 2010.
    Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases,
    and dividend payments from our operating activities. Our
    positive cash flows in fiscal 2010 allowed us to support our
    business and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders.
    During fiscal 2010, dividends paid to stockholders were 94% of
    net income. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate
    investments as of May 31, 2010, along with projected
    operating cash flows, will support our normal business
    operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the
    foreseeable future.

For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal
    years 2010, 2009, and 2008, and our financial position as of
    May 31, 2010, refer to the tables and analysis in the
    “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and
    Capital Resources” sections of this Item 7 and the
    discussion in the “Critical Accounting Policies”
    section of this Item 7.

Outlook

Our outlook for fiscal 2011 is based upon current economic and
    interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes.
    Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections
    do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest
    rates. We project that payroll service revenue for fiscal 2011
    will be flat compared to fiscal 2010. Human Resource Services
    revenue is anticipated to increase in the range of 10% to 13%.
    Interest on funds held for clients is expected to decrease in
    the range of 12% to 17%, while investment income, net is
    expected to increase in the range of 24% to 27%.

Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of
    service revenue is expected to range from 34% to 35% for fiscal
    2011. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate
    35% for fiscal 2011. Net income is expected to improve slightly
    over fiscal 2010. However, when the impact of the expense charge
    to increase the litigation reserve is excluded from fiscal 2010,
    net income growth for fiscal 2011 is expected to be flat.

Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for
    fiscal 2011 are expected to be impacted by the low-interest-rate
    environment. The average rate of return on our combined funds
    held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected
    to be 1.3% for fiscal 2011. As of May 31, 2010, the
    long-term investment portfolio had an average

yield-to-maturity

of 2.9% and an average duration of 2.5 years. In the next
    twelve months, slightly over 15% of this portfolio will mature,
    and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be
    reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately
    1.0%. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing
    investment of cash generated from operations.

Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to our
    earnings from a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in
    short-term interest rates would be approximately
    $3.5 million, after taxes, for a twelve-month period. Such
    a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the
    Federal Funds rate.

Purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2011 are expected
    to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million, as
    we continue to invest in our technological infrastructure.
    Fiscal 2011 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range
    of $65 million to $70 million, and we project
    amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2011 to be
    approximately $20 million.

Payroll service revenue:

Payroll
    service revenue decreased 5% to $1.4 billion for fiscal
    2010 as a result of the cumulative adverse effects of weak
    economic conditions on our client base and check volume. Our
    client base decreased 3.2% during fiscal 2010 and checks per
    client decreased 2.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    Checks per client has shown modest improvement in each
    sequential quarter of fiscal 2010, reflecting

year-over-year

declines of 5.0%, 3.7%, and 2.2% for the first through third
    fiscal quarters, and an increase of 1.1% for the three months
    ended May 31, 2010 (the “fourth quarter”). At the
    end of fiscal 2010, checks per client were slightly higher than
    at the end of fiscal 2009. Payroll service revenue increased 1%
    to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2009 due to our annual price
    increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll
    services, offset by impacts of weak economic conditions. During
    fiscal 2009, our client base declined 3.1%, affected by a
    decline in new client sales from new business starts and clients
    lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having
    any employees. Checks per client declined 2.9% for fiscal 2009.

Our payroll tax administration services were utilized by 94% of
    all our clients as of May 31, 2010, compared with 93% as of
    May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008. Our employee payment
    services were utilized by 77% of our clients as of May 31,
    2010, compared with 75% as of May 31, 2009 and 73% as of
    May 31, 2008. Nearly all new clients purchase our payroll
    tax administration services and more than 80% of new clients
    select a form of our employee payment services.

Human Resource Services revenue:

Human
    Resource Services revenue increased 3% for fiscal 2010 and 11%
    for fiscal 2009 to $540.9 million and $523.6 million,
    respectively. The following factors contributed to Human
    Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009:

Includes workers’ compensation insurance clients and health

In addition, growth in products that are primarily beneficial to
    our MMS clients contributed positively to Human Resource
    Services revenue growth for fiscal 2010. Health and benefits
    service revenue increased 49% to $31.0 million for fiscal
    2010 and increased 70% to $20.9 million for fiscal 2009.



While the above factors contributed to the revenue growth in
    both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 as compared to the respective
    prior year periods, the rates of growth have been adversely
    affected by the cumulative impact of weak economic conditions on
    our client base growth. This particularly affected retirement
    services, although we have seen client growth for retirement
    services rebound somewhat late in fiscal 2010 as client losses
    have improved compared to the prior year.

Retirement services revenue growth was impacted in both fiscal
    2010 and fiscal 2009 by billings in fiscal 2009 related to
    restatements of clients’ retirement plans required by
    statute, which are not expected to recur for approximately six
    years. This favorably impacted retirement services revenue
    growth for fiscal 2009 by $12.4 million and did not recur
    in fiscal 2010.

In fiscal 2010, Human Resource Services revenue was also
    impacted by the sale of Stromberg time and attendance
    (“Stromberg”), an immaterial component of Paychex. Our
    Human Resource Services revenue growth, excluding Stromberg
    revenue and the retirement plan restatement billings, would have
    been as follows:

In fiscal 2010, the 33% increase in the asset value of
    retirement services client employees’ funds was driven by
    recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger
    plans converting to Paychex. For fiscal 2009, the volatility in
    the financial markets caused the asset value of retirement
    services client employees’ funds to decline 12%. The
    S&P 500 declined 34% during the same period. For both
    fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, retirement services revenue growth
    was adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of assets in the
    retirement services client employees’ funds to investments
    earning lower fees from external fund managers.

For fiscal 2009, the decline in asset value and the shift in
    client employees’ retirement portfolios to investments
    earning lower fees from external fund managers reduced
    retirement services revenue growth by $8.9 million. Also
    for fiscal 2009, Paychex HR Solutions revenue growth was
    adversely impacted by fewer employees per client, decreasing
    revenue by $8.7 million.

Total service revenue:

Total service
    revenue declined 3% for fiscal 2010 and increased 4% for fiscal
    2009. The cumulative effect of the weak economy had a negative
    impact on service revenue growth as previously described.

Interest on funds held for clients:

The
    decrease of 27% in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal
    2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average
    interest rates earned and lower average investment balances,
    offset somewhat by higher net realized gains on sales of

available-for-sale

securities. The decrease of 43% in interest on funds held for
    clients for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was the result
    of lower average interest rates earned, lower average investment
    balances, and lower net realized gains on sales of

available-for-sale

securities.

Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased
    5% for fiscal 2010 and 3% for fiscal 2009. These declines were
    the result of the cumulative adverse effect of weak economic
    conditions on our client base and lower tax withholdings for
    client employees resulting from the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “economic stimulus
    package”). In the second half of fiscal 2010, the impact of
    these factors was partially offset by increases in state
    unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year. The
    economic stimulus package went into effect in April 2009, and
    its impact on

year-over-year

comparisons of average invested balances has abated in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. This factor, along with the
    increases in state unemployment insurance rates, resulted in
    average invested balances for funds held for clients growing 3%
    for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the same
    period in fiscal 2009.

    in Item 7A of this

During fiscal 2010, we recorded an expense charge of
    $18.7 million to increase our litigation reserve. Refer to
    Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for additional information on legal matters.

Excluding the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve,
    combined operating and SG&A expenses decreased 2% for
    fiscal 2010 and increased 3% for fiscal 2009. The decline for
    fiscal 2010 was generated from cost control measures and lower
    headcount, offset slightly by costs related to continued
    investment in our sales force, customer service, and
    technological infrastructure. In fiscal 2010, we had a freeze on
    salary increases and made no matching contributions to our
    401(k) plan. We reinstituted salary increases beginning
    March 1, 2010, but the freeze saved us approximately
    $15.0 million for fiscal 2010. As of May 31, 2010, no
    decision had been made on the reinstatement of the 401(k) match,
    although we saved approximately $15.0 million for fiscal
    2010 from its suspension. The increase for fiscal 2009 was
    primarily due to increases in personnel, though at a slower pace
    than prior years, and other costs related to selling and
    retaining clients and promoting new services. As of May 31,
    2010, we had approximately 12,200 employees compared with
    approximately 12,500 employees as of May 31, 2009 and
    12,200 employees as of May 31, 2008.

Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings,
    furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software.
    Increases in depreciation expense were due to capital
    expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow
    our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily
    related to client list acquisitions, which are amortized using
    either straight-line or accelerated methods. The increase in
    amortization in fiscal 2009 was a result of intangibles from
    acquisitions and client list acquisitions. Other expenses
    include items such as delivery, forms and supplies,
    communications, travel and entertainment, professional services,
    and other costs incurred to support our business.

Operating income:

Operating income
    declined 10% and 3% for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009,
    respectively. The fluctuations in operating income were
    attributable to the factors previously discussed.

Investment income, net:

Investment
    income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and
    cash equivalents and investments in

available-for-sale

securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds
    held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The
    decrease of 34% in investment income for fiscal 2010 compared to
    fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates
    earned offset somewhat by higher average investment balances
    resulting from investment of cash generated from operations. The
    decrease of 74% in investment income for fiscal 2009 compared
    with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower average interest
    rates earned and lower average investment balances attributed to
    funding the stock repurchase program, which was completed in
    December 2007.

Income taxes:

Our effective income tax
    rate was 34.6% for fiscal 2010, compared with 34.3% for fiscal
    2009, and 32.6% for fiscal 2008. The increase in our effective
    income tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of
    higher state income tax rates from state legislative changes.
    The increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009
    was primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income
    derived from municipal debt securities in the funds held for
    clients and corporate investment portfolios. Refer to
    Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for additional disclosures on income taxes.

Net income and earnings per share:

Net
    income decreased 11% for fiscal 2010 and 7% for fiscal 2009 to
    $477.0 million and $533.5 million, respectively.
    Diluted earnings per share decreased 11% for fiscal 2010 and 5%
    for fiscal 2009 to $1.32 per share and $1.48 per share,
    respectively. These fluctuations were attributable to the
    factors previously discussed. In particular, the
    $18.7 million expense charge to increase the litigation
    reserve reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 per share
    for fiscal 2010. Combined interest on funds held for clients and
    corporate investment income for fiscal 2010 decreased 28% or
    $22.8 million, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.04
    per share. For fiscal 2009, combined interest on funds held for
    clients and corporate investment income decreased 48% or
    $76.0 million, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.14
    per share. For fiscal 2009, diluted earnings per share decreased
    at a lower rate than net income due to a lower number of
    weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from the stock
    repurchase program completed in December 2007.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The volatility in the global financial markets that began in
    September 2008 curtailed available liquidity and limited
    investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic environment, our
    financial position as of May 31, 2010 remained strong with
    cash and total corporate investments of $656.9 million and
    no debt. We also believe that our investments as of May 31,
    2010 were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date
    that would indicate any

other-than-temporary

impairment. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate
    investments as of May 31, 2010, along with projected
    operating cash flows, are expected to support our normal
    business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments
    for the foreseeable future.

Commitments
    and Contractual Obligations

Lines of credit:

As of May 31,
    2010, we had unused borrowing capacity available under four
    uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market rates
    of interest with financial institutions as follows:

Financial institution

Our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are
    secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between
    Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the
    “Lenders”), pursuant to which we have granted each of
    the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment
    securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
    custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and
    is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the
    Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may
    require that



collateral be transferred from the pooled account into
    segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
    short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
    overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic
    payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary
    course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding
    against these lines of credit during fiscal 2010 or as of
    May 31, 2010.

JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. are also
    parties to our irrevocable standby letters of credit, which
    arrangements are discussed below.

Letters of credit:

As of May 31,
    2010, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding
    totaling $50.3 million, required to secure commitments for
    certain of our insurance policies. The letters of credit expire
    at various dates between July 2010 and May 2011, and are
    collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios.
    No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during
    fiscal 2010 or as of May 31, 2010. Subsequent to
    May 31, 2010, the letter of credit expiring in
    July 2010 was renewed and will expire in July 2011.

Other commitments:

We have entered into
    various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under
    GAAP, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    May 31, 2010. The table below summarizes our estimated
    annual payment obligations under these commitments as of
    May 31, 2010:

    used in our branch operations.

(2)

Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum
    outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and
    services and legally binding contractual arrangements with
    future payment obligations. Included in the total purchase
    obligations is $8.9 million of commitments to purchase
    capital assets. Amounts actually paid under certain of these
    arrangements may be higher due to variable components of these
    agreements.

The liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately
    $27.5 million as of May 31, 2010. Refer to Note H
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for more information on income taxes. We are not able to
    reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to
    this liability and have excluded it from the table above. We are
    currently under a state income tax audit for the years ended
    May 31, 2004 through 2007. The examination phase of the
    audit is ongoing and we have received a summary of proposed
    audit adjustments. It is not possible for us to reasonably
    estimate the impact, if any, if resolution of these proposed
    adjustments is ultimately unfavorable to us.

Certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other
    long-term liabilities amounting to $46.9 million are
    excluded from the table above because the timing of actual
    payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to
    the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of
    future payments.

Advantage Payroll Services Inc. (“Advantage”) has
    license agreements with independently owned associate offices
    (“Associates”), which are responsible for selling and
    marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain
    operational functions, while Paychex and Advantage provide all
    centralized back-office payroll processing and payroll tax
    administration services. Under these arrangements, Advantage
    pays the Associates commissions based on processing activity for
    the related clients. When we acquired Advantage, there were
    fifteen Associates. Over the past few years, some arrangements
    with various Associates have been discontinued, and there are
    currently fewer than ten Associates. Since the actual amounts of
    future payments are uncertain, obligations under these
    arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission
    expense for the Associates for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008
    was $9.9 million, $12.3 million, and
    $15.3 million, respectively.



We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance
    contracts for clients who financed their service contracts
    through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make
    representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of
    services under service arrangements with clients. Historically,
    there have been no material losses related to such guarantees.
    In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements
    with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and,
    if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or
    future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to
    us.

We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various
    insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. Our
    estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is
    recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been
    material. We also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our
    purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for
    employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty
    liability, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles
    and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance
    company.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in
    transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special
    purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would
    have been established for the purpose of facilitating
    off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do
    maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing
    projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations.
    These investments are accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting and are less than 1% of our total assets as of
    May 31, 2010.

The decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 related
    primarily to lower net income adjusted for non-cash items and
    changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in
    non-cash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2010 is primarily
    due to the $18.7 million expense charge to increase the
    litigation reserve, partially offset by the related increase in
    deferred tax benefit. The decrease in our operating cash flows
    for fiscal 2009 was attributable to lower net income. The
    increase in non-cash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2009 is
    primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization on
    property and equipment and intangible assets. The fluctuations
    in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both
    fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were primarily related to the timing
    of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO
    payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.

Funds held for clients and corporate
    investments:

Funds held for clients consist
    of short-term funds and

available-for-sale

securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of

available-for-sale

securities. The



portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is
    detailed in Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

The fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and
    corporate investment activities reflect the changing mix of
    investments. As a result of volatility in the financial markets,
    in September 2008 we divested of any VRDN securities held and
    began to utilize U.S. agency discount notes as our primary
    short-term investment vehicle. U.S. agency discount notes
    are cash equivalents. VRDNs, although priced and traded as
    short-term securities, are classified as

available-for-sale

securities and the cash paid and proceeds received for these
    securities are included in investing activities. As a result of
    the divestiture, the proceeds from sales of

available-for-sale

securities exceeded the purchases of

available-for-sale

securities in fiscal 2009. Much of these proceeds were held as
    cash equivalents in the funds held for clients portfolio. In
    November 2009, we began to again invest in select

A-1/P-1-rated

VRDNs, although at considerably lower levels than in the prior
    year. We utilized some of our cash equivalents to purchase these
    VRDNs, and in fiscal 2010 these purchases of

available-for-sale

securities were in excess of funds received from any sales of

available-for-sale

securities. Also in fiscal 2010, more corporate funds have been
    invested in longer-term municipal bonds. There is a significant
    decline in net cash received from changes in funds held for
    clients and corporate investment activities in fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008 related to proceeds from sales of

available-for-sale

securities in fiscal 2008 that were not reinvested as part of
    the funding of the $1.0 billion stock repurchase program
    completed in December 2007.

In general, fluctuations in net funds held for clients and
    corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of
    purchases, sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of
    funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of
    collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax
    administration services and to employees of clients utilizing
    employee payment services. Additional discussion of interest
    rates and related risks is included in the “Market Risk
    Factors” section, contained in Item 7A of this

Form 10-K.

Purchases of long-lived assets:

To
    support our continued client and ancillary product growth,
    purchases of property and equipment were made for data
    processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and
    upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal 2010,
    fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately
    $3.2 million, $4.5 million, and $4.4 million,
    respectively, of data processing equipment and software from
    EMC Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief
    Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board of
    Directors (the “Board”).

During fiscal 2010, we received $13.1 million from the sale
    of Stromberg, an immaterial component of the Company. During
    fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, we paid $6.4 million and
    $32.9 million, respectively, related to acquisitions of
    businesses. The acquisitions in fiscal 2008 related mainly to
    employee benefits products. The purchases of other assets were
    for customer lists.

Net change in client fund
    obligations:

The client fund obligations
    liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client
    funds, and the related required remittance of funds to
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax
    administration services and to employees of clients utilizing
    employee payment services. Collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days. As a



result of May 31, 2010 being a Federal holiday, client fund
    obligations were higher as collections were made on Friday,
    May 28, 2010 that were not remitted to client employees and
    tax or regulatory agencies until June 2010. Also, in fiscal 2010
    we have seen an increase in client fund obligations as a result
    of higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related
    to rate increases for the 2010 calendar year.

Repurchases of common stock:

We
    repurchased 23.7 million shares of common stock for a total
    of $1.0 billion under our stock repurchase program
    completed in December 2007.

Dividends paid:

A quarterly dividend of
    $0.31 per share was paid to stockholders of record during fiscal
    2010 and fiscal 2009. In July 2008, our Board approved a 3%
    increase in our quarterly dividend payment to $0.31 per share
    from $0.30 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net
    income totaled 94%, 84%, and 77% for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009,
    and fiscal 2008, respectively. The payment of future dividends
    is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject
    to the discretion of our Board.

Exercise of stock options:

Proceeds
    from and excess tax benefit related to exercise of stock options
    decreased for fiscal 2010 and for fiscal 2009 as compared to the
    respective prior years. Common shares acquired through exercise
    of stock options were 0.4 million shares for each of fiscal
    2010 and fiscal 2009 and 2.0 million shares for fiscal
    2008. Refer to Note B to the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

    incentive plans.

    Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently
    issued accounting pronouncements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex, Inc.
    Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that
    affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and
    expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting
    policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical
    experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be
    reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts
    and results could differ from these estimates. Certain
    accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of
    operations or financial position are discussed below.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenue is
    recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
    service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
    or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Certain processing services are provided under annual service
    arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
    service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to
    payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a
    fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per
    processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction
    processed. The revenue earned from delivery service for the
    distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is
    included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are
    included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
    Income.

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net
    of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes,
    benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct
    costs billed and incurred were $3.1 billion for fiscal
    2010, and $2.6 billion for both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.

Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized
    when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence that
    an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order;
    delivery is complete for the



software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free
    of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in
    conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance
    solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is
    recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

In certain situations we allow a client a right of return or
    refund. We maintain an allowance for returns, which is based on
    historical data. The allowance is reviewed periodically for
    adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in our results
    of operations for the period in which the adjustment is
    identified.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
    that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
    administration services and for employee payment services, and
    invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on
    these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and
    remitting of these funds are critical components of providing
    these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
    net realized gains and losses from the sales of

available-for-sale

securities.

PEO workers’ compensation
    insurance:

Workers’ compensation
    insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated
    costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves
    include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those
    claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain
    expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In
    establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves,
    we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future
    cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
    and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
    actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
    multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal
    liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially
    impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from
    our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not
    occur until well into the future.

We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’
    compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously
    established reserves are reflected in our results of operations
    for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such
    adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
    variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

Our maximum individual claims liability was $1.0 million
    under both the fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 policies. As of
    May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009, we had recorded current
    liabilities of $5.8 million and $7.9 million,
    respectively, and long-term liabilities of $20.1 million
    and $17.9 million, respectively, for workers’
    compensation claims.

Goodwill and other intangible
    assets:

We have $421.6 million and
    $433.3 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009,
    respectively, resulting from acquisitions of businesses. The
    decrease in goodwill was due to the divestiture in fiscal 2010
    of Stromberg, an immaterial component of the Company.

Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment on
    an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
    circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a
    potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.
    Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including
    goodwill. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result,
    substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one
    reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment testing in our
    fiscal fourth quarter. Based on the results of our reviews, no
    impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for
    fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. Subsequent to this review, there
    have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential
    impairment of our goodwill balance.

We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable.

Stock-based compensation costs:

All
    stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock
    options, are recognized as compensation costs in our
    Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values
    measured



as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock
    option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This
    model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected
    volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life.
    We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical
    volatility using weekly stock prices over a period equal to the
    expected option life and implied market volatility. Expected
    option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior.

We are required to estimate forfeitures and only record
    compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest.
    Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of
    award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are
    adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified
    with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the
    final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to
    equal actual forfeitures.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in our results of operations.

We have determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
    as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application,
    is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option
    grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our
    choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model
    if additional information becomes available in the future
    indicating that another model would provide a more accurate
    estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants
    would warrant such a change.

Income taxes:

We account for deferred
    taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
    included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax
    returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are determined based on the difference between the financial
    statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
    tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to
    the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain
    stock-based awards. At the time of exercise of non-qualified
    stock options or vesting of stock awards, we account for the
    resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax
    liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any
    excess tax benefit increasing additional paid-in capital. We
    currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in
    additional paid-in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits
    related to stock-based awards.

We maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate
    tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for
    recognition in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to
    recording the related tax benefit in our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, we must conclude that tax positions must be
    “more likely than not” to be sustained, assuming those
    positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full
    knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in
    our Consolidated Financial Statements is the amount we expect to
    realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax
    position drops below the “more likely than not”
    standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions,
    judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining
    if the “more likely than not” standard has been met
    when developing the provision for income taxes and in
    determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of
    the “more likely than not” standard could materially
    impact our results of operations or financial position. Our
    reserve for uncertain tax positions was $27.5 million as of
    May 31, 2010 and $25.7 million as of May 31,
    2009. Refer to Note H of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further discussion of our reserve for
    uncertain tax positions.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk Factors

Changes in interest rates and interest rate
    risk:

Funds held for clients are primarily
    comprised of short-term funds and

available-for-sale

securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of

available-for-sale

securities. As a result of our operating and investing
    activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may
    materially affect our results of operations and financial
    position. Changes in interest rates will impact the



earnings potential of future investments and will cause
    fluctuations in the fair value of our longer-term

available-for-sale

securities. We follow a conservative investment strategy of
    optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. We invest
    primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA
    ratings and short-term securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single
    issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments
    whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We
    manage the

available-for-sale

securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three
    years. All investments held as of May 31, 2010 are traded
    in active markets.

Since September 2008, our primary short-term investment vehicle
    has been U.S. agency discount notes. In September 2008, we
    sold all of our holdings of VRDNs and prime money market funds
    as a result of turmoil in the related markets. No losses were
    recognized on those sales. The proceeds from the sales of these
    investments were reinvested in U.S. agency discount notes.
    Since then, we have seen gradual improvement in liquidity in
    certain money market sectors, and starting in November 2009 we
    began to invest in select

A-1/P-1-rated

VRDNs. During fiscal 2010, we earned an after-tax rate of
    approximately 0.21% for VRDNs compared to approximately 0.07%
    for U.S. agency discount notes. We have no exposure to
    high-risk or illiquid investments such as auction rate
    securities,

sub-prime

mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed
    commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash
    or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles
    (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial
    instruments to manage our interest rate risk.

During fiscal 2010, the average interest rate earned on our
    combined funds held for clients and corporate investment
    portfolios was 1.5%, compared with 2.1% for fiscal 2009 and 3.7%
    for fiscal 2008. With the turmoil in the financial markets, our
    conservative investment strategy has translated to significantly
    lower yields on high quality instruments. When interest rates
    are falling, the full impact of lower interest rates will not
    immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of
    short- and long-term interest rate changes. During a falling
    interest rate environment, the decreases in interest rates
    decrease earnings from our short-term investments, and over time
    decrease earnings from our longer-term

available-for-sale

securities. Earnings from the

available-for-sale

securities, which as of May 31, 2010 had an average
    duration of 2.5 years, would not reflect decreases in
    interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the
    proceeds are reinvested at lower rates. In the next twelve
    months, slightly over 15% of our

available-for-sale

portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that
    these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest
    rate of approximately 1.0%.

The amortized cost and fair value of

available-for-sale

securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2010
    are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can
    differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have
    the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

VRDNs are primarily categorized as due after five years in the
    table above as the contractual maturities on these securities
    are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are
    issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as
    short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through
    the tender feature.

The Federal Funds rate was a range of zero to 0.25% as of
    May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009.

Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates
    involves many factors. These factors include, but are not
    limited to:

•

daily interest rate changes;

•

seasonal variations in investment balances;

•

actual duration of short-term and

available-for-sale

securities;

•

the proportional mix of taxable and tax-exempt investments;

•

changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment
    rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous; and

•

financial market volatility and the resulting effect on
    benchmark and other indexing interest rates.

Subject to these factors and under normal financial market
    conditions, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates
    generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately
    17 basis points.

Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and
    corporate investments) averaged approximately $3.8 billion
    for fiscal 2010. Our anticipated allocation is approximately 50%
    invested in short-term securities and

available-for-sale

securities with an average duration of less than 30 days,
    and 50% invested in

available-for-sale

securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three
    years.

The combined funds held for clients and corporate

available-for-sale

securities reflected a net unrealized gain of $66.6 million
    as of May 31, 2010, compared with a net unrealized gain of
    $66.7 million as of May 31, 2009. During fiscal 2010,
    the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from
    $55.1 million to $82.4 million. During fiscal 2009,
    the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of
    $15.2 million to a net unrealized gain of
    $86.6 million. The net unrealized gain of our investment
    portfolios was approximately $71.9 million as of
    July 12, 2010.

As of May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009, we had
    $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, invested
    in

available-for-sale

securities at fair value. The weighted-average

yield-to-maturity

was 2.9% and 3.3% as of May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009,
    respectively. The weighted-average

yield-to-maturity

excludes

available-for-sale

securities tied to short-term interest rates such as the VRDNs
    held as of May 31, 2010. We held no VRDNs as of
    May 31, 2009. Assuming a hypothetical decrease in both
    short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis
    points, the resulting potential increase in fair value for our
    portfolio of

available-for-sale

securities as of May 31, 2010, would be approximately
    $12.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding increase in
    interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair
    value. This hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value
    of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the
    portfolio’s recorded value, with an offsetting amount
    recorded in stockholders’ equity. These fluctuations in
    fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the
    results of operations, unless any declines in fair value were
    considered to be

other-than-temporary

and an impairment loss recognized.



Credit risk:

We are exposed to credit
    risk in connection with these investments through the possible
    inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We
    regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any
    investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential
    valuation concerns. We believe that the investments we held as
    of May 31, 2010 were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired. While $73.6 million of our

available-for-sale

securities had fair values that were below amortized cost, we
    believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will
    be collected in accordance with the contractual terms, and that
    the decline in the fair value to $0.4 million below
    amortized cost was due to changes in interest rates and was not
    due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns. All of
    the securities in an unrealized loss position as of May 31,
    2010 and the majority of the securities in an unrealized loss
    position as of May 31, 2009 held an AA rating or better. We
    intend to hold these investments until the recovery of their
    amortized cost basis or maturity, and further believe that it is
    more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these
    investments prior to that time. Our assessment that an
    investment is not

other-than-temporarily

impaired could change in the future due to new developments or
    changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any
    particular investment.

REPORT ON
    MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Paychex, Inc. (the “Company”) is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system
    of internal control over financial reporting as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Our internal control over
    financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits
    and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
    guidelines, and careful selection and training of qualified
    personnel.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
    even when determined to be effective, can only provide
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

The Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors
    meets with the independent registered public accounting firm
    (the “independent accountants”), management, and
    internal auditors periodically to discuss internal control over
    financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting
    matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent
    accountants the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit
    Committee also meets periodically with the independent
    accountants and the chief internal auditor without management
    present to ensure that the independent accountants and the chief
    internal auditor have free access to the Audit Committee. The
    Audit Committee’s Report can be found in the Definitive
    Proxy Statement to be issued in connection with the
    Company’s 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
    2010. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
    set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission in “Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework.” Based on our assessment, management
    believes that the Company maintained effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of May 31, 2010.

The Company’s independent accountants, Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, are
    appointed by its Audit Committee. Ernst & Young LLP
    has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial
    Statements of Paychex, Inc. and the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The
    reports of the independent accountants are contained in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors

and the Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited Paychex Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    Paychex Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on
    Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Paychex, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of May 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended May 31, 2010 of Paychex, Inc.,
    and our report dated July 16, 2010, expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors

and the Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Paychex, Inc. as of May 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(1). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
    Paychex, Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Paychex, Inc. at May 31, 2010 and
    2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Paychex, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of May 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated July 16, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A —

Description
    of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of business:

Paychex, Inc.
    and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company” or
    “Paychex”) is a leading provider of payroll, human
    resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to
    medium-sized businesses in the United States (“U.S.”).
    The Company also has a subsidiary in Germany.

Paychex, a Delaware corporation formed in 1979, reports as one
    segment. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is
    generated within the U.S. The Company also generates
    revenue within Germany, which was less than one percent of its
    total revenue for each of the years ended May 31, 2010
    (“fiscal 2010”), 2009 (“fiscal 2009”), and
    2008 (“fiscal 2008”). Long-lived assets in Germany are
    insignificant in relation to total long-lived assets of the
    Company as of May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009.

Total revenue is comprised of service revenue and interest on
    funds held for clients. Service revenue is comprised of the
    Payroll and Human Resource Services portfolios of services and
    products. Payroll service revenue is earned primarily from
    payroll processing, payroll tax administration services,
    employee payment services, and other ancillary services. Payroll
    processing services include the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; preparation of
    federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
    and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations.

In connection with the automated payroll tax administration
    services, the Company electronically collects payroll taxes from
    clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepares and
    files the applicable tax returns, and remits taxes to the
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due
    dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and
    30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The Company handles
    regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest
    disputes, and is subject to cash penalties imposed by tax or
    regulatory agencies for late filings and late or under payment
    of taxes. With employee payment services, employers are offered
    the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll
    debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account
    (Readychex

®

),

    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by Paychex. For the first three methods,
    Paychex electronically collects net payroll from the
    clients’ bank account, typically one business day before
    payday, and provides payment to the employee on payday.

In addition to service fees paid by clients, the Company earns
    interest on funds held for clients that are collected before due
    dates and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or
    regulatory agencies or client employees. The funds held for
    clients and related client fund obligations are included in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as current assets and current
    liabilities. The amount of funds held for clients and related
    client fund obligations varies significantly during the year.

The Human Resource Services portfolio of services and products
    provides small- to medium-sized businesses with retirement
    services administration, insurance services, eServices, and
    other human resource services and products. Paychex HR Solutions
    is available as an administrative services organization
    (“ASO”) and a professional employer organization
    (“PEO”). Both options provide a combined package of
    services that include payroll, employer compliance, human
    resource and employee benefits administration, risk management
    outsourcing, and the

on-site

availability of a professionally trained human resource services
    representative. These comprehensive bundles of services are
    designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
    payroll and related benefits costs while providing a benefits
    package equal to that of larger companies. The PEO differs from
    the ASO in that Paychex serves as a co-employer of the
    clients’ employees, assumes the risks and rewards of
    workers’ compensation insurance, and provides more
    sophisticated health care offerings to PEO clients. PEO services
    are sold through the Company’s registered and licensed
    subsidiary, Paychex Business Solutions, Inc.

Basis of presentation:

The Consolidated
    Financial Statements include the accounts of Paychex, Inc. and
    its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company
    has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition

and/or

disclosure through the date of issuance of these financial
    statements.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash and
    cash equivalents consist of available cash, money market
    securities, U.S. agency discount notes, and other
    investments with a maturity of three months or less as of the
    balance sheet date.

Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful
    accounts:

Accounts receivable balances are
    shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts of $1.9 million as of May 31,
    2010 and $4.0 million as of May 31, 2009. The decrease
    in allowance for doubtful accounts from May 31, 2009 was
    the result of the sale of Paychex Time and Attendance Inc.
    (“Stromberg”), an immaterial component of the Company.
    No single client had a material impact on total accounts
    receivable, service revenue, or results of operations.

Funds held for clients and corporate
    investments:

Marketable securities included
    in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist
    primarily of securities classified as

available-for-sale

and are recorded at fair value obtained from an independent
    pricing service. The funds held for clients portfolio also
    includes cash, money market securities, and short-term
    investments. Unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable
    income taxes, are reported as comprehensive income in the
    Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Realized
    gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities
    are determined by specific identification of the cost basis of
    each security. On the Consolidated Statements of Income,
    realized gains and losses from their respective portfolios are
    included in interest on funds held for clients and investment
    income, net.

Concentrations:

Substantially all of
    the Company’s deposited cash is maintained at two large
    credit-worthy financial institutions. These deposits may exceed
    the amount of any insurance provided. All of the Company’s
    deliverable securities are held in custody with one of the two
    aforementioned financial institutions, for which that
    institution bears the risk of custodial loss. Non-deliverable
    securities, primarily time deposits and money market mutual
    funds, are restricted to credit-worthy financial institutions.

Property and equipment, net of accumulated
    depreciation:

Property and equipment is
    stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
    Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of property
    and equipment using the straight-line method. The estimated
    useful lives of depreciable assets are generally ten to
    35 years or the remaining life, whichever is shorter, for
    buildings and improvements; two to seven years for data
    processing equipment; seven years for furniture and fixtures;
    and ten years or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter,
    for leasehold improvements. Normal and recurring repair and
    maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. The
    Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for
    impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.

Software development and
    enhancements:

Expenditures for software
    purchases and software developed for internal use are
    capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives, which are generally three to five years,
    except for substantial changes in the functionality of
    processing applications, for which the estimated useful life may
    be longer. For software developed for internal use certain costs
    are capitalized including external direct costs of materials and
    services associated with developing or obtaining the software,
    and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are
    directly associated with internal-use software projects.
    Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at
    which the project is substantially complete and ready for its
    intended use. Costs associated with preliminary project stage
    activities, training, maintenance, and other post-implementation
    stage activities are expensed as incurred. The carrying value of
    software and development costs is reviewed for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of such assets may not be recoverable.

Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated
    amortization:

The Company has recorded
    goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of businesses.
    Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment on
    an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
    circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a
    potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.
    Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including
    goodwill. The Company’s business is largely homogeneous
    and, as a result, substantially all the goodwill is associated
    with one reporting unit.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company performs its annual impairment testing in its fiscal
    fourth quarter. Based on the results of the Company’s
    reviews, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of
    operations for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, or fiscal 2008.
    Subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or
    circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the
    Company’s goodwill balance.

Intangible assets are comprised of client list acquisitions and
    are reported net of accumulated amortization on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Intangible assets are amortized over periods
    generally ranging from five to twelve years using either the
    straight-line method, an accelerated method, or based on client
    attrition. The Company tests intangible assets for potential
    impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.

Other long-term assets:

Included in
    other long-term assets is the Company’s investment as a
    limited partner in various low-income housing partnerships.
    These partnerships were determined to be variable interest
    entities (“VIEs”). The Company is not the primary
    beneficiary of these VIEs and, therefore, does not consolidate
    them in its results of operations or financial position. The
    investments in these partnerships are accounted for under the
    equity method of accounting, with the Company’s share of
    partnership losses recorded in investment income, net on the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. The net investment in these
    entities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was
    $0.6 million as of May 31, 2010 and $1.5 million
    as of May 31, 2009.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenue is
    recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
    service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
    or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Certain processing services are provided under annual service
    arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
    service period. The Company’s service revenue is largely
    attributable to payroll-related processing services where the
    fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed
    amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or
    transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service
    for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and
    reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the
    delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net
    of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes,
    benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct
    costs billed and incurred were $3.1 billion for fiscal
    2010, and $2.6 billion for both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.

Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized
    when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence that
    an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order;
    delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is
    fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and
    collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are
    generally purchased by the Company’s clients in conjunction
    with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions.
    Revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably
    over the term of the contract.

In certain situations the Company allows a client a right of
    return or refund. The Company maintains an allowance for
    returns, which is based on historical data. The allowance is
    reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to
    revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in
    which the adjustment is identified.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
    that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
    administration services and for employee payment services, and
    invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on
    these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and
    remitting of these funds are critical components of providing
    these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
    net realized gains and losses from the sales of

available-for-sale

securities.

Advantage Payroll Services Inc. (“Advantage”), a
    subsidiary of the Company, has license agreements with
    independently owned associate offices (“Associates”).
    The Associates are responsible for selling and marketing



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational
    functions. Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized
    back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration
    services for the Associates, including the billing and
    collection of processing fees and the collection and remittance
    of payroll and payroll tax funds pursuant to Advantage’s
    service arrangement with Associate customers. The marketing and
    selling by the Associates is conducted under their respective
    logos. Commissions earned by the Associates are based on the
    processing activity for the related clients. Revenue generated
    from customers as a result of these relationships and
    commissions paid to Associates are included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income as service revenue and selling, general and
    administrative expense, respectively.

PEO workers’ compensation
    insurance:

Workers’ compensation
    insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated
    costs of paying claims underwritten by the Company. These
    reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for
    those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain
    expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In
    establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves,
    the Company uses an independent actuarial estimate of
    undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle
    the claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
    and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
    actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
    multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal
    liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially
    impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from
    the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not
    occur until well into the future.

The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated
    workers’ compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to
    previously established reserves are reflected in the results of
    operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified.
    Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
    variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

The Company’s maximum individual claims liability was
    $1.0 million under both its fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009
    policies. As of May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009, the
    Company had recorded current liabilities of $5.8 million
    and $7.9 million, respectively, and long-term liabilities
    of $20.1 million and $17.9 million, respectively, on
    its Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation
    claims.

Stock-based compensation costs:

All
    stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock
    options, are recognized as compensation costs in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values
    measured as of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair
    value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs
    including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and
    expected option life. Volatility is estimated based on a
    combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices
    over a period equal to the expected option life and implied
    market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on
    historical exercise behavior.

The Company is required to estimate forfeitures and only record
    compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest.
    The assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of
    award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are
    adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified
    with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the
    final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to
    equal actual forfeitures.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in the Company’s results of operations.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its
    application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of
    stock option grants. The Company periodically reassesses its
    assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will
    reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes
    available in the future indicating that another model would
    provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if
    characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.

Refer to Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion of the Company’s
    stock-based compensation plans.

Income taxes:

The Company accounts for
    deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and
    liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
    that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
    or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
    financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities
    using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a
    deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs
    recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of the
    exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of stock
    awards, the Company accounts for the resulting tax deduction by
    reducing its accrued income tax liability with an offset to the
    deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing
    additional paid-in capital. The Company currently has a
    sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in
    capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to
    stock-based awards.

The Company maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions. The
    Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
    a tax return for recognition in its Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company must conclude
    that tax positions must be “more likely than not” to
    be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by
    taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant
    information. The benefit recognized in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements is the amount the Company expects to
    realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax
    position drops below the “more likely than not”
    standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions,
    judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining
    if the “more likely than not” standard has been met
    when developing the provision for income taxes and in
    determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of
    the “more likely than not” standard could materially
    impact the Company’s results of operations or financial
    position. The Company’s reserve for uncertain tax positions
    was $27.5 million as of May 31, 2010 and
    $25.7 million as of May 31, 2009. Refer to Note H
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    discussion of the Company’s reserve for uncertain tax
    positions.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires
    management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that
    affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts and results
    could differ from these estimates.

Recently adopted accounting
    pronouncements:

Effective June 1, 2009,
    the Company adopted the following Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) authoritative guidance, none of which
    had a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements:

•

Revised guidance on business combinations that establishes
    principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring the
    identifiable assets acquired (including goodwill), liabilities
    assumed, and noncontrolling interests, if any, acquired in a
    business combination. This guidance also requires that
    acquisition-related costs and costs associated with
    restructuring or exiting activities of an acquired entity be
    expensed as incurred;

•

Guidance on subsequent events that establishes standards related
    to accounting for and disclosure of events that happen after the
    date of the balance sheet but before the release of the
    financial statements;



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Guidance on determination of the useful life of intangible
    assets that amends the factors that should be considered in
    developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine
    the useful life of a recognized intangible asset; and

•

Updates to authoritative standards that provide additional
    application guidance and enhance disclosures regarding fair
    value measurements and impairment of debt securities. Refer to
    Notes D and E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for disclosures related to the Company’s
    investments in debt securities and fair value measurements.

Effective September 1, 2009, the Company adopted the
    following FASB authoritative guidance, which did not have a
    material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements:

•

Guidance that establishes the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (the “Codification”). The Codification,
    released on July 1, 2009, became the single source of
    authoritative non-governmental U.S. GAAP and supercedes all
    previously existing accounting standards. The adoption changed
    certain disclosure references to U.S. GAAP; and

•

Guidance providing acceptable valuation techniques for measuring
    the fair value of a liability in circumstances in which a quoted
    price in an active market for an identical liability may not be
    available.

Effective December 1, 2009, the Company adopted the
    following FASB authoritative guidance, which did not have a
    material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements:

•

Guidance that clarifies that the stock portion of a dividend
    payment that is part cash and part stock be considered a share
    issuance in calculating earnings per share; and

•

Guidance that clarifies the scope of the

decrease-in-ownership

provisions in the Codification and expands the information an
    entity is required to disclose upon the consolidation or
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary.

Effective March 1, 2010, the Company adopted FASB
    authoritative guidance aimed at improving disclosures about fair
    value measurements. This guidance adds new disclosure
    requirements for transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy
    Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases,
    sales, issuances, and settlements relating to Level 3
    measurements. It also clarifies existing disclosure requirements
    regarding the level of disaggregation for classes of assets and
    liabilities, and about inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure fair value. The adoption of this guidance did not have a
    material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Recently issued accounting
    pronouncements:

In June 2009, the FASB issued
    the following authoritative guidance, which was incorporated
    into the Codification in December 2009:

•

Guidance amending the accounting and reporting standards for
    transfers and servicing of financial assets, including the
    removal of the concept of a qualifying special purpose
    entity; and

•

Guidance to require a qualitative analysis rather than a
    quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation to determine
    the primary beneficiary of a VIE for consolidation purposes.
    This qualitative approach focuses on identifying which entity
    has the power to direct the activities of a VIE with the most
    significant impact on the VIE’s economic performance.

Both of these items are effective for annual periods beginning
    after November 15, 2009, and are applicable to the
    Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2010. The
    Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a
    material effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related
    to revenue recognition as follows:

•

Guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables that are
    outside the scope of the software revenue recognition
    guidance; and



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Guidance eliminating tangible products containing both software
    and non-software components that operate together to deliver a
    product’s functionality from the scope of current GAAP for
    software.

Both of these items are effective prospectively for revenue
    arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years
    beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption
    permitted, and are applicable to the Company’s fiscal year
    beginning June 1, 2011. The Company does not expect the
    adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other recent authoritative guidance issued by the FASB
    (including technical corrections to the Codification), the
    American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the
    Securities and Exchange Commission did not, or are not expected
    to have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Note B —

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

The Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and
    restated (the “2002 Plan”), effective on
    October 12, 2005 upon its approval by the Company’s
    stockholders, authorizes grants of up to 29.1 million
    shares of the Company’s common stock. As of May 31,
    2010, there were 14.1 million shares available for future
    grants under the 2002 Plan. No future grants will be made
    pursuant to the Paychex, Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, which
    expired in August 2002; however, options to purchase an
    aggregate of 1.5 million shares under the plan remain
    outstanding as of May 31, 2010.

All stock-based awards to employees are recognized as
    compensation costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements
    based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant.
    These costs are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period and increase additional paid-in capital. For
    grants prior to June 1, 2006, costs were recognized on an
    accelerated basis over the requisite service period.

Stock-based compensation expense was $25.6 million,
    $25.7 million, and $25.4 million for fiscal 2010,
    fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008, respectively. Related income tax
    benefits recognized were $7.9 million, $8.0 million,
    and $7.4 million for the respective fiscal years.
    Capitalized stock-based compensation costs related to the
    development of internal use software for these same fiscal years
    were not significant.

As of May 31, 2010, the total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to all unvested stock-based awards was
    $52.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Stock option grants:

Stock option
    grants entitle the holder to purchase, at the end of the vesting
    term, a specified number of shares of Paychex common stock at an
    exercise price per share set equal to the closing market price
    of the common stock on the date of grant. All stock option
    grants have a contractual life of ten years from the date of the
    grant and a vesting schedule as established by the Board of
    Directors (the “Board”). The Company issues new shares
    of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises. Non-qualified
    stock option grants to officers, outside directors, and
    management are typically approved by the Board in July.
    Non-qualified stock option grants to officers and management
    vest 20% per annum while grants to the Board vest one-third per
    annum.

The Company has granted stock options to virtually all
    non-management employees with at least 90 days of service,
    and shares remain outstanding for the following broad-based

The fair value of stock option grants was estimated at the date

PAYCHEX,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Risk-free interest rates are yields for zero coupon
    U.S. Treasury notes maturing approximately at the end of
    the expected option life. The estimated volatility factor is
    based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly
    stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and
    implied market volatility. The expected option life is based on
    historical exercise behavior.

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its
    application, are appropriate in estimating the fair value of its
    stock option grants. The Company periodically assesses its
    assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will
    reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes
    available in the future indicating that another model would
    provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if
    characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.

Restricted stock awards:

The Board has
    approved grants of restricted stock awards to the Company’s
    officers and outside directors in accordance with the 2002 Plan.
    All shares underlying awards of restricted stock are restricted
    in that they are not transferable until they vest. The
    recipients of the restricted stock have voting rights and earn
    dividends, which are paid to the recipient at the time of
    vesting of the awards. If the recipient leaves Paychex prior to
    the vesting date for any reason, the shares of restricted stock
    and the dividends accrued on those shares will be forfeited and
    returned to Paychex.

For restricted stock awards granted to officers, the shares vest
    upon the fifth anniversary of the grant date provided the
    recipient is still an employee of the Company on that date.
    These awards have a provision for the acceleration of vesting
    based on achievement of performance targets established by the
    Board. If the established targets are met for a fiscal year, up
    to one-third of the award may vest. If all the targets are met
    for three consecutive years, the award will be fully vested. For
    outside directors, the shares vest on the third anniversary of
    the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock awards is
    equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock
    as of the date of grant and is expensed over the requisite
    service period on a straight-line basis.

Restricted stock units:

Beginning in

    (“RSUs”) to non-officer management as a replacement of
    non-qualified stock options. RSUs do not have voting rights or
    earn dividend equivalents during the vesting period. These
    awards vest 20% per annum over five years with a small
    population of awards vesting on the fourth anniversary of the
    grant date. The fair value of RSUs is equal to the

Non-compensatory employee benefit
    plan:

The Company offers an Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan to all employees under which the Company’s
    common stock can be purchased through a payroll deduction with
    no discount to the market price and no look-back provision. All
    transactions occur directly through the Company’s transfer
    agent and no brokerage fees are charged to employees, except for
    when stock is sold. The plan has been deemed non-compensatory
    and therefore, no stock-based compensation costs have been
    recognized for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, or fiscal 2008 related
    to this plan.

The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these
    investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet
    the terms of their bonds. In addition, the Company is exposed to
    interest rate risk, as rate volatility will cause fluctuations
    in the fair value of held investments and in the earnings
    potential of future investments. The Company follows a
    conservative investment strategy of optimizing liquidity and
    protecting principal. The Company invests primarily in high
    credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term
    securities with

The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolios to
    determine if any investment is

other-than-

temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other
    potential valuation concerns. The Company believes that the
    investments held as of May 31, 2010 were not
    other-than-temporarily impaired. While $73.6 million of

available-for-sale

securities had fair values that were below amortized cost, the
    Company believes that it is probable that the principal and
    interest will be collected in accordance with contractual terms,
    and that the decline in the fair value to $0.4 million
    below amortized cost was due to changes in interest rates and
    was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation
    concerns. All of the securities in an unrealized loss position
    as of May 31, 2010 and the majority of the securities in an
    unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2009 held an AA
    rating or better. The Company intends to hold these investments
    until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity,
    and further believes that it is more likely than not that it
    will not be required to sell these investments prior to that
    time. The Company’s assessment that an investment is not

other-than-temporarily

impaired could change in the future due to new developments or
    changes in the Company’s strategies or assumptions related
    to any particular investment.

VRDNs are primarily categorized as due after five years in the
    table above as the contractual maturities on these securities
    are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are
    issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as
    short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through
    the tender feature.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and accounts
    payable approximate fair value due to the short maturities of
    these instruments. Marketable securities included in funds held
    for clients and corporate investments consist primarily of
    securities classified as

available-for-sale

and are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.

The accounting standards related to fair value measurements
    include a hierarchy for information and valuations used in
    measuring fair value that is broken down into three levels based
    on reliability, as follows:

•

Level 1 valuations are based on quoted prices in active
    markets for identical instruments that the Company has the
    ability to access.

•

Level 2 valuations are based on quoted prices for similar,
    but not identical, instruments in active markets; quoted prices
    for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
    active; or other than quoted prices observable inputs.

•

Level 3 valuations are based on information that is
    unobservable and significant to the overall fair value
    measurement.

In determining the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the
    Company predominately uses the market approach. In determining
    the fair value of its

available-for-sale

securities, the Company utilizes the Interactive Data Pricing
    service. Other securities are comprised of mutual fund
    investments, which are valued based on quoted market prices.
    Other long-term liabilities include the liability for the
    Company’s non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation
    plans, and are valued based on the quoted market prices for
    various mutual fund investment choices.

The preceding methods described may produce a fair value
    calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value
    or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the
    Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
    consistent with other market participants, the use of different
    methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
    certain financial instruments could result in a different fair
    value measurement at the reporting date.

On June 1, 2007, the Company adopted authoritative
    accounting guidance on uncertain tax positions. This guidance
    prescribes minimum recognition thresholds for evaluating
    uncertain income tax positions, and provides information on
    derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and
    transition. The impact of the adoption mainly affected the state
    income tax rate, net of federal benefit.

Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect
    adjustment by increasing its reserve for uncertain tax positions
    by $8.4 million, with an offsetting decrease to opening
    retained earnings. As of May 31, 2010 and May 31,
    2009, the total reserve for uncertain tax positions was

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well
    as income tax in one foreign and numerous state jurisdictions.
    Uncertain tax positions relate primarily to state income tax
    matters. The Company believes it is probable that the reserve
    for uncertain tax positions will increase in the next twelve
    months, resulting from the settlement of open periods and the
    effect of operations on anticipated tax benefits. It is
    anticipated that this increase will impact the tax provision in
    the range of $1.0 million to $3.0 million. The Company
    is currently under a state income tax audit for fiscal years
    2004 through 2007. The examination phase of the audit is
    ongoing. On July 14, 2010, the Company received a summary
    of proposed tax audit adjustments from the New York State
    Department of Taxation and Finance, which are in excess of the
    reserve recorded as of May 31, 2010. The Company is
    currently evaluating the proposed tax audit adjustments and
    preparing a response to those proposed adjustments. The Company
    expects to vigorously defend its positions. While the Company
    believes its reserve for uncertain tax positions is adequate, it
    is not possible to reasonably estimate the impact, if any, if
    resolution is ultimately unfavorable to the Company. An
    unfavorable outcome of this matter could have a material adverse
    impact on the Company’s financial position and results of
    operations in the period in which the matter is concluded.

The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax
    matters through its fiscal year ended May 31, 2007. Fiscal
    2008 is currently under examination and fiscal 2009 and fiscal
    2010 are still subject to potential audit. With limited
    exception, state income tax audits by taxing authorities are
    closed through fiscal 2005, primarily due to expiration of the
    statute of limitations. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit
    settlements are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. As of
    May 31, 2010, substantially all of the $27.5 million
    reserve for uncertain tax positions, if recognized, would
    favorably affect the Company’s effective income tax rate.

The Company continues to follow its policy of recognizing
    interest and penalties accrued on tax positions as a component
    of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
    amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with the
    Company’s tax positions is immaterial to the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The amount of interest and penalties recognized
    for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was immaterial to the
    Company’s results of operations.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

401(k) plan:

The Company maintains a
    contributory savings plan that qualifies under
    section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Paychex,
    Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan (the “Plan”)
    allows all employees to immediately participate in the salary
    deferral portion of the Plan, contributing up to a maximum of
    50% of their salary. Employees who have completed one year of
    service are eligible to receive a company matching contribution,
    when such contribution is in effect. Prior to April 2009, the
    Company matched up to 100% of the first 3% of eligible pay and
    up to 50% of the next 2% of eligible pay that an employee
    contributed to the Plan. Prior to September 2007, the Company
    matched 50% of an employee’s voluntary contribution up to
    6% of eligible pay. Effective April 3, 2009, the Company
    suspended the employer matching contribution and as of
    May 31, 2010, had not yet made a decision related to its
    reinstatement.

The Plan is 100% participant-directed. Plan participants can
    fully diversify their portfolios by choosing from any or all
    investment fund choices in the Plan. Transfers in and out of
    investment funds, including the Paychex, Inc. Employee Stock
    Ownership Plan (ESOP) Stock Fund, are not restricted in any
    manner. The Company match contribution, when in effect, follows
    the same fund elections as the employee compensation deferrals.

Company contributions to the Plan for fiscal 2009 and fiscal
    2008 were $14.3 million and $15.1 million,
    respectively.

Deferred compensation plans:

The
    Company offers non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation
    plans to a select group of key employees, executive officers,
    and outside directors. Eligible employees are provided with the
    opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and
    bonus and outside directors to defer 100% of their Board cash
    compensation. Gains and losses are credited based on the
    participant’s election of a variety of investment choices.
    The Company does not match any participant deferral or guarantee
    its return. Distributions are paid at one of the following dates
    selected by the participant: the participant’s termination
    date, the date the participant retires from any active
    employment, or a designated specific date. In fiscal 2009,
    participants were allowed to make a one-time election for a
    distribution under the Internal Revenue Service
    Section 409A transition rules. The amounts accrued under
    these plans were $7.3 million and $6.2 million as of
    May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009, respectively, and are
    reflected in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Lines of credit:

As of May 31,

The credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are
    secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between
    Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the
    “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Company has granted
    each of the Lenders a security interest in certain investment
    securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
    custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and
    is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the
    Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may
    require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account
    into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual
    Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
    short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
    overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic
    payment transactions on behalf of clients in

the ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were
    outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2010 or
    as of May 31, 2010.

JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. are also
    parties to the Company’s irrevocable standby letters of
    credit, which arrangements are discussed below.

Letters of credit:

The Company had
    irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling
    $50.3 million and $65.8 million as of May 31,
    2010 and May 31, 2009, respectively, required to secure
    commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of
    credit expire at various dates between July 2010 and May 2011,
    and are collateralized by securities held in the Company’s
    investment portfolios. No amounts were outstanding on these
    letters of credit during fiscal 2010 or as of May 31, 2010.
    Subsequent to May 31, 2010, the letter of credit expiring
    in July 2010 was renewed and will expire in July 2011.

Contingencies:

The Company is subject
    to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal
    course of its business. These include disputes or potential
    disputes related to breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
    duty, employment-related claims, tax claims, and other matters.

In August 2001, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,
    Rapid Payroll, Inc. (“Rapid Payroll”) informed
    76 licensees that it intended to stop supporting their
    payroll processing software in August of 2002. The communication
    was sent due to the licensee contract assumed by Paychex during
    the acquisition of Rapid Payroll in 1996 being very unfavorable
    to the Company. Thereafter, lawsuits were commenced by licensees
    asserting various claims, including breach of contract and
    related tort and fraud causes of action.

On March 9, 2010, the Court of Appeal of the State of
    California upheld a jury verdict issued on June 27, 2007 in
    litigation brought by one of the licensees. In that case, the
    California Superior Court, Los Angeles County jury awarded to
    the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory damages and
    subsequently awarded an additional $11.0 million in
    punitive damages. The Company satisfied the judgment, including
    statutory interest, without further appeal. This was the final
    pending matter in the Rapid Payroll litigation.

During fiscal 2010, the Company increased its litigation reserve
    by $18.7 million for the Rapid Payroll litigation. The
    Company’s management currently believes that resolution of
    outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent
    uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate
    resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact
    on the Company’s financial position and the results of
    operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

Lease commitments:

The Company leases
    office space and data processing equipment under terms of
    various operating leases. Rent expense for fiscal years 2010,
    2009, and 2008 was $46.9 million, $46.6 million, and
    $44.5 million, respectively. As of May 31, 2010,
    future minimum lease payments under various non-cancelable
    operating leases with terms of more than one year are as follows:

    orders and legally binding contractual arrangements with minimum
    future payment obligations of approximately $73.0 million,

    assets. These minimum future payment obligations relate to the

The Company guarantees performance of service on annual
    maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service
    contracts through a third party. In the normal course of
    business, the Company makes representations and warranties that
    guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements
    with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses
    related to such guarantees. In addition, the Company has entered
    into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors,
    which require the Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify
    these individuals for certain pending or future claims as they
    relate to their services provided to the Company.

Paychex currently self-insures the deductible portion of various
    insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. The
    Company’s estimated loss exposure under these insurance
    arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued
    have not been material. The Company also maintains insurance
    coverage in addition to its purchased primary insurance policies
    for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and
    omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism; and
    capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through its
    captive insurance company.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting:

Disclosure controls
    and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that
    information required to be disclosed in the Company’s
    reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”), such as this report, is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure
    controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of
    ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated
    to the Company’s management, including the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures:

As of the end of the
    period covered by this report, the Company carried out an
    evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
    the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and
    procedures as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this
    report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective.

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
    Reporting:

We also carried out an evaluation
    of the internal control over financial reporting to determine
    whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this
    report. Based on such evaluation, there has been no changes in
    the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting
    that occurred during the Company’s most recently completed
    fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2010, that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

The Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm on Effectiveness of Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting are incorporated herein by
