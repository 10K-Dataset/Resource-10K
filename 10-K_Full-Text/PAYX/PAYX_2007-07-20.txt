PART I

“SAFE
    HARBOR” STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION
    REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain written and oral statements made by management of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“we,”
    “our,” “us,” or the “Company”) may
    constitute “forward-looking statements” as defined in
    the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the
    “Reform Act”). Forward-looking statements are
    identified by such words and phrases as “we expect,”
    “expected to,” “estimates,”
    “estimated,” “current outlook,” “we
    look forward to,” “would equate to,”
    “projects,” “projections,” “projected
    to be,” “anticipates,” “anticipated,”
    “we believe,” “could be,” and other similar
    phrases. All statements addressing operating performance,
    events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur
    in the future, including statements relating to revenue growth,
    earnings, earnings per share growth, or similar projections, are
    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act.
    Because they are forward-looking, they should be evaluated in
    light of important risk factors. These risk factors include, but
    are not limited to, the following as well as those described in
    “Risk Factors” under Item 1A and elsewhere in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Form 10-K”):

•

General market and economic conditions, including, among others,
    changes in United States (“U.S.”) employment and wage
    levels, changes in new hiring trends, changes in short- and
    long-term interest rates, and changes in the market value and
    the credit rating of securities held by us;

•

Changes in demand for our services and products, ability to
    develop and market new services and products effectively,
    pricing changes and the impact of competition, and the
    availability of skilled workers;

•

Changes in the laws regulating collection and payment of payroll
    taxes, professional employer organizations, and employee
    benefits, including retirement plans, workers’
    compensation, state unemployment, and section 125 plans;

•

Changes in our Professional Employer Organization
    (“PEO”) direct costs, including, but not limited to,
    workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends;

•

The possibility of failure to keep pace with technological
    changes and provide timely enhancements to services and products;

•

The possibility of failure of our operating facilities, computer
    systems, and communication systems during a catastrophic event;

•

The possibility of third-party service providers failing to
    perform their functions;

•

The possibility of penalties and losses resulting from errors
    and omissions in performing services;

•

The possible inability of our clients to meet their payroll
    obligations;

•

The possible failure of internal controls or our inability to
    implement business processing improvements; and

•

Potentially unfavorable outcomes related to pending legal
    matters.

Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from our anticipated results. The information
    provided in this document is based upon the facts and
    circumstances known at this time. We undertake no obligation to
    update these forward-looking statements after the date of filing
    of this

Form 10-K

with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
    “Commission”) to reflect events or circumstances after
    such date, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Item 1.

Business

We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and
    integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing
    solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses in the
    U.S. As of May 31, 2007, we serviced approximately
    561,000 clients and had approximately 11,700 employees. We
    maintain our corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and
    have more than 100 offices nationwide.



As of May 31, 2007, we also serviced approximately 900
    clients in Germany through offices in Hamburg, Berlin, Munich,
    and Dusseldorf.

Our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in 1979. We
    report our results of operations and financial condition as one
    business segment. Our fiscal year ends May 31.

Company
    Strategy

We are focused on achieving strong, long-term financial
    performance by:

•

Providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable
    comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource services.

•

Delivering these services utilizing a well-trained and
    responsive work force through a network of local and corporate
    offices servicing more than 100 of the largest markets in the
    U.S. and in Germany.

•

Growing our client base, primarily through the efforts of our
    direct sales force.

•

Continually improving client service and maximizing client
    retention.

•

Capitalizing on the growth opportunities within our current
    client base and from new clients by increasing utilization of
    our payroll and human resource ancillary services and products.

•

Capitalizing on and leveraging our highly developed
    technological and operating infrastructure.

•

Supplementing our growth through strategic acquisition or
    expansion of service offerings when appropriate opportunities
    arise.

Market
    Opportunities

The outsourcing of business processes continues to be a trend
    within the U.S. Outsourcing of the payroll and human
    resource functions allows small- to medium-sized businesses to
    minimize the administrative burden and compliance risks
    associated with increasingly complex and changing administrative
    requirements and federal, state, and local tax regulations. By
    utilizing the expertise of outsourcing service providers,
    businesses are better able to efficiently meet their compliance
    requirements and administrative burdens while, at the same time,
    providing competitive benefits for their employees. The
    technical capabilities, knowledge, and operational expertise
    that we have built, along with the broad portfolio of ancillary
    services and products we offer our clients, have enabled us to
    capitalize on the outsourcing popularity.

We believe there are approximately 7.6 million employers in
    the geographic markets that we currently serve within the
    U.S. Of those employers, 99% have fewer than
    100 employees and are our primary customers and target
    market. Based on publicly available industry data, we estimate
    that all payroll processors combined serve between 15% to 20% of
    the potential businesses in the target market, with much of the
    unpenetrated market being composed of businesses with ten or
    fewer employees. We remain focused on servicing small- to
    medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we
    believe exists in this market segment.

Clients

We serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients
    operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the
    U.S. As of May 31, 2007, we serviced approximately
    561,000 clients. We utilize service agreements and arrangements
    with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any
    time or upon relatively short notice. For the year ended
    May 31, 2007 (“fiscal 2007”), client retention
    was at a record level of slightly more than 80% of our beginning
    client base. The most significant factor contributing to client
    losses is companies going out of business. No single client has
    a material impact on total service revenue or results of
    operations.

    the U.S.) by employee size is as follows:

Services
    and Products

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services and products that
    allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human
    resource needs. These include:

•

payroll processing;

•

payroll tax administration services;

•

employee payment services;

•

regulatory compliance services (new-hire reporting and
    garnishment processing);

•

comprehensive human resource outsourcing services;

•

retirement services administration;

•

workers’ compensation insurance services;

•

health and benefits services;

•

employee benefits administration;

•

time and attendance solutions; and

•

other human resource services and products.

By offering ancillary services that leverage the information
    gathered in the base payroll processing service, we are able to
    provide comprehensive outsourcing services that allow employers
    to expand their employee benefits offerings at an affordable
    cost. We mainly earn our revenue through recurring fees for
    services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the
    number of clients, utilization of ancillary services, and checks
    or transactions per client per pay period.

Payroll
    Processing

Payroll processing is the foundation of our service portfolio.
    Our payroll service includes the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; and the preparation
    of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns. Payroll
    processing clients are charged a base fee each period that
    payroll is processed, plus a fee per employee check processed.
    Our payroll services are provided through either our Core
    Payroll or Major Market Services (“MMS”).

Core Payroll clients may communicate their payroll information,
    including hours worked by each employee and any personnel or
    compensation changes, by telephone, fax, use of the Paychex
    Paylink

®

software, or the Internet. Each client is assigned a payroll
    specialist who is trained extensively and continuously in all
    facets of payroll preparation and applicable tax regulations.
    Clients receive payroll checks and reports from either a
    delivery service, the U.S. Postal Service, or by picking
    them up at one of our local branches.

We also offer Core Payroll services to our clients and their
    accountants through Paychex Online. This secure Internet site
    offers clients a suite of interactive, self-service services and
    products twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. These
    include Paychex Online
    Payroll

sm

,
    Internet Time Sheet, Paychex Online Reports, and General Ledger
    Reporting Service. Clients can communicate payroll information
    through the Internet Time Sheet or use the



Online Payroll service, and can access current and historical
    payroll information using Paychex Online Reports. The General
    Ledger Reporting Service transfers payroll information
    calculated by us to the clients’ general ledger accounting
    software, eliminating manual entries and improving the accuracy
    of bookkeeping. Approximately 257,000 clients are currently
    utilizing some form of Paychex Online service.

MMS primarily targets companies that have more complex payroll
    and benefits needs or have outgrown our Core Payroll service. We
    currently offer this service in all of our significant markets.
    Approximately one-third of new MMS clients are conversions from
    our Core Payroll service.

Most MMS clients communicate their payroll information to us
    using our
    Preview

®

software. Preview provides clients with in-house control of
    payroll and human resource information because the software and
    the payroll and human resource database reside on the
    clients’ personal computer or personal computer network.
    Clients can produce reports and checks at their convenience. We
    handle the software maintenance and provide the client ancillary
    services and products as requested. Our Internet-based human
    resource management system, HR Online, provides an interface for
    our MMS clients to Preview. HR Online is a tool for managing
    payroll, reports, and employee records and benefits.

Ancillary
    Services and Products

We provide our clients with a portfolio of ancillary services
    and products that have been developed and refined over many
    years. Ancillary services and products provide us with
    additional recurring revenue streams and increased service
    efficiencies as these services and products are integrated with
    our payroll processing services. We offer the following
    ancillary services and products:

Payroll Tax Administration Services:

As
    of May 31, 2007, 93% of our clients utilized our payroll
    tax administration services (including
    Taxpay

®

),
    which provide accurate preparation and timely filing of
    quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic
    transfer of funds to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies
    (federal, state, and local). Nearly all of our new clients
    purchase our payroll tax administration services. We believe
    that the client utilization percentage of these services is near
    maturity. In connection with these services, we electronically
    collect payroll taxes from clients’ bank accounts,
    typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable tax
    returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically
    paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections
    from clients, with some items extending to 90 days. We
    handle all regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty
    and interest disputes, and we are subject to cash penalties
    imposed by tax or regulatory agencies for late filings and late
    or under payment of taxes. Clients utilizing the payroll tax
    administration services are charged a base fee and a fee per
    transaction for each period that payroll is processed. In
    addition to fees paid by clients, we earn interest on client
    funds that are collected before due dates and invested until
    remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies.

Employee Payment Services:

As of
    May 31, 2007, 71% of our clients utilized our employee
    payment services, which provide the employer the option of
    paying their employees by direct deposit, Paychex Access
    Visa

®

Card, a check drawn on a Paychex, Inc. account
    (Readychex

®

),
    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by us. More than 80% of new clients select
    some form of employee payment services. For the first three
    methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the
    clients’ bank account, typically one day before payday, and
    provide payment to the employee on payday. Our flexible payment
    options provide a cost-effective solution that offers the
    benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation
    for employers. Clients utilizing employee payment services are
    charged a base fee for each period that payroll is processed and
    a fee per transaction or per employee depending on the service
    provided. In addition to fees paid by clients, we earn interest
    on client funds that are collected before pay dates and invested
    until remittance to clients’ employees.

The payroll tax administration services and employee payment
    services are integrated with our payroll processing service.
    Interest earned on funds held for clients is included in total
    revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the
    collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical
    components of providing these services.

Regulatory Compliance Services:

We
    offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to
    comply with federal and state requirements to report information
    on newly hired employees, to aid the government in



enforcing child support orders, and to minimize fraudulent
    unemployment and workers’ compensation insurance claims.
    Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from
    employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies,
    including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the
    obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to
    comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties.

Comprehensive Human Resource Outsourcing
    Services:

Paychex
    Premier

sm

Human Resource Services (“Paychex Premier”) provides
    businesses a full-service approach to the outsourcing of
    employer and employee administrative needs. Paychex Premier
    offers businesses a combined package of services that includes
    payroll, employer compliance, human resource and employee
    benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and the

on-site

availability of a professionally trained human resource
    representative. This comprehensive bundle of services is
    designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
    payroll and related benefit costs while providing a benefits
    package equal to that of larger companies. Our PEO provides
    businesses with primarily the same services as Paychex Premier,
    except we serve as a co-employer of the clients’ employees,
    assume the risks and rewards of workers’ compensation
    insurance, and provide more sophisticated health care offerings
    to PEO clients. Our PEO service is available primarily for
    clients domiciled in select U.S. states where the
    utilization of PEOs is more prevalent. We offer our PEO service
    through our subsidiary, Paychex Business Solutions, Inc. For
    these two services, the client pays a fee per employee per
    processing period. As of May 31, 2007, our comprehensive
    human resource outsourcing serviced approximately 373,000 client
    employees.

Retirement Services Administration:

Our
    retirement services product line offers a variety of options to
    clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE, SIMPLE IRA,
    401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, profit sharing, and
    money purchase plans. These services provide plan
    implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations,
    employee and employer reporting, participant and employer access
    online, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative
    services. Clients have the ability to choose from a group of
    pre-defined fund selections or to customize their investment
    options within their plan. Selling efforts for these services
    are focused primarily on our existing payroll client base, as
    the processed payroll information allows for data integration
    necessary to provide these services efficiently. Retirement
    services were utilized by approximately 44,000 clients as of
    May 31, 2007. This demonstrates the continuing interest of
    small- to medium-sized businesses in providing retirement
    savings benefits to their employees. We are one of the largest
    401(k) recordkeepers for small businesses in the
    U.S. Clients utilizing this service are charged a one-time
    set up fee, a monthly recurring fee, and a fee per employee. The
    asset value of client employee 401(k) funds externally managed
    totaled approximately $8.5 billion as of May 31, 2007.
    We earn a fee approximating forty basis points from the external
    managers based on the total asset value of client employee
    401(k) funds.

Workers’ Compensation Insurance
    Services:

Most employers are required to
    carry workers’ compensation insurance, which provides
    payments to employees who are unable to work because of
    job-related injuries. We provide workers’ compensation
    insurance services through our licensed insurance agency, acting
    as general agent to provide insurance through a variety of
    insurance carriers who are underwriters. Our Workers’
    Compensation Payment Service uses rate and job classification
    information to enable clients to pay workers’ compensation
    premiums in regular monthly amounts rather than with large
    up-front payments, which stabilizes their cash flow and
    minimizes year-end adjustments. Our Workers’ Compensation
    Report Service provides our clients with comprehensive
    information to allow them to better manage workers’
    compensation insurance costs. As of May 31, 2007,
    approximately 62,000 clients utilized our workers’
    compensation insurance services.

Health and Benefits Services:

We offer
    health and benefits services through our licensed insurance
    agency, acting as general agent to provide insurance through a
    variety of carriers who are underwriters. Our services include
    shopping for the best plans, providing comparisons of national
    and regional insurers to match features and affordability to the
    client’s needs, informing and enrolling employees, tracking
    additions and terminations, calculating and initiating payroll
    deductions, communicating with the insurance carrier, and
    assisting with renewal of policies. These services simplify the
    insurance process while allowing access to group rates, which
    allow our clients to offer valuable benefits to their employees
    at an affordable cost.

Employee Benefits Administration:

We
    offer the outsourcing of plan administration under
    section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Premium Only
    Plan allows employees to pay for certain health insurance
    benefits with pretax dollars, which can result in a reduction in
    payroll taxes for employers and employees. The Flexible



Spending Account Plan allows our clients’ employees to pay,
    with pretax dollars, health and dependent care expenses not
    covered by insurance. All required implementation,
    administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement,
    and coverage tests are provided with these services. The Health
    Savings Account product serves as a tax savings tool for
    employers and employees, allowing individuals to save money
    tax-free to pay for qualified medical expenses now and in the
    future. It also provides the means to manage rising health
    insurance premiums.

Time and Attendance Solutions:

We offer
    Time In A
    Box

®

and other time and attendance solutions, which help employers
    minimize the time spent compiling time sheet information. These
    computer-based systems allow the employer flexibility to handle
    multiple payroll scenarios and result in improved productivity,
    accuracy, and reliability in the payroll process. Certain
    clients are charged a monthly fee for use of hardware, software,
    and support. Clients also have the option to purchase the
    hardware and software with annual maintenance contracts. Time In
    A Box is marketed to our small- to medium-sized clients, while
    other time and attendance solutions are marketed to larger
    clients.

Other Human Resource Services and
    Products:

Group and individual health
    benefits are offered in select geographic areas, as are state
    unemployment insurance services, which provide clients with
    prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations,
    change statements, and requests for separation documents. Other
    Human Resource Services products include employee handbooks,
    management manuals, and personnel and required regulatory forms.
    These products are designed to simplify clients’ office
    processes and enhance their employee benefits programs.

Sales and
    Marketing

We market our services primarily through our direct sales force
    based in the metropolitan markets we serve. Our sales
    representatives specialize in Core Payroll, MMS, or Human
    Resource Services. For our year ending May 31, 2008, our
    sales force is expected to total approximately 2,220 with 1,245
    for Core Payroll (including international), 260 for MMS payroll,
    and 715 for various Human Resource Services. The Human Resource
    Services sales force includes 320 human resources and retirement
    services sales representatives, 205 Paychex Premier and PEO
    sales representatives, 60 licensed agents selling workers’
    compensation insurance, 95 licensed agents selling health and
    benefits services, and 35 time and attendance solution sales
    representatives. Growth in the direct sales force results from
    the offering of new services and products, particularly as it
    relates to licensed agents for health and benefits.

In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we
    utilize relationships with existing clients, certified public
    accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client
    referrals. Approximately two-thirds of our new clients
    (excluding acquisitions) come from these referral sources. To
    further enhance our strong relationship with CPAs, we have
    partnered with the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll
    provider for its AICPA Business Solutions Partner Program. This
    program includes our Core Payroll, MMS, and retirement services.

Our website at

www.paychex.com

, which includes online
    payroll sales presentations and service and product information,
    is a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of leads and
    new sales while complementing the efforts of our direct sales
    force. This online tool allows us to market to clients in more
    geographically remote areas. Our sales representatives are also
    supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade
    shows, and telemarketing programs. We have grown and expect to
    continue to grow our direct sales force. In recent years, we
    have increased our emphasis on the selling of ancillary services
    and products to both new clients and our existing client base.

In addition, Advantage Payroll Services Inc.
    (“Advantage”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex,
    Inc., has license agreements with independently owned associate
    offices (“Associates”), which are responsible for
    selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing
    certain operational functions, while Paychex, Inc. and Advantage
    provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and
    payroll tax administration services. The marketing and selling
    by the Associates is conducted under their own logos.



Competition

The market for payroll processing and human resource services is
    highly competitive and fragmented. We believe our primary
    national competitor,
    ADP

®

(“Automatic Data Processing, Inc.”), is the largest
    U.S. third-party provider of payroll processing and human
    resource services in terms of revenue. We compete with other
    national, regional, local, and online service providers, all of
    which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us.

In addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource
    service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and human
    resource systems and departments. Payroll and human resource
    systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our Human
    Resource Services products also compete with a variety of
    providers of human resource services, such as retirement
    services companies, insurance companies, and human resources and
    benefits consulting firms.

Competition in the payroll processing and human resource
    services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness,
    product quality and reputation, breadth of service and product
    offering, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of
    these areas.

Software
    Maintenance and Development

The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and
    regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the
    proprietary software we utilize to provide Payroll and Human
    Resource Services to our clients. We are continually engaged in
    developing enhancements to and maintenance of our various
    software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our
    clients and the marketplace.

Employees

As of May 31, 2007, we employed approximately
    11,700 people. None of our employees were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements.

Intellectual
    Property

We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names,
    copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and
    software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a
    whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the
    conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be
    appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual
    property rights, including, but not limited to,
    confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with
    employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with
    licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and
    registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the
    “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material
    importance to us.

Seasonality

There is no significant seasonality to our business. However,
    during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the
    number of new Payroll clients, new Retirement Services clients,
    and new Paychex Premier and PEO worksite employees tends to be
    higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily
    because a majority of new clients begin using our services in
    the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end
    transaction processing and client funds activity are
    traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to
    clients paying year-end bonuses and requesting additional
    year-end services. Historically, as a result of these factors,
    our total revenue has been slightly higher in the third fiscal
    quarter, with greater sales commission expenses also reported in
    this quarter.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our future results of operations are subject to a number of
    risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could
    cause actual results to differ materially from historical and
    current results and from our projections. Important factors
    known to us that could cause such differences include, but are
    not limited to, those discussed below and those contained in the
    “Safe Harbor” statement at the beginning of
    Part I of this

Form 10-K.

We may make errors and omissions in providing services,
    which could result in significant penalties and liabilities for
    us:

Processing, tracking, collecting, and
    remitting client funds to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies, client employees, and other third parties are complex
    operations. These tasks could be subject to error and these
    errors could include, but are not limited to, late filing with
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies, underpayment of taxes,
    and failure to comply with applicable banking regulations and
    laws relating to employee benefits administration, which could
    result in significant penalties and liabilities that would
    adversely affect our results of operations. We could also
    transfer funds in error to an incorrect party or for the wrong
    amount, and may be unable to correct the error or recover the
    funds, resulting in a loss to us.

Our business and reputation may be affected by our ability
    to keep clients’ information
    confidential:

Our business involves the use
    of significant amounts of private and confidential client
    information including employees’ identification numbers,
    bank accounts, and retirement account information. This
    information is critical to the accurate and timely provision of
    services to our clients, and certain information may be
    transmitted via the Internet. There is no guarantee that our
    systems and processes are adequate to protect against all
    security breaches. If our systems are disrupted or fail for any
    reason, or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized
    persons, our clients could experience data loss, financial loss,
    harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. Such
    events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation,
    regulation investigation and penalties, loss of clients’
    business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, and there
    could be a material adverse effect on our business and results
    of operations.

Our services may be adversely impacted by changes in
    government regulations and policies:

Many of
    our services, particularly payroll tax administration services
    and employee benefit plan administration services, are designed
    according to government regulations that continue to change.
    Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of
    benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide
    employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and
    employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or
    eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially
    decrease our revenue. Added requirements could also increase our
    cost of doing business. Failure by us to modify our services in
    a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

We may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party
    service providers to perform their
    functions:

As part of providing services to
    clients, we rely on a number of third-party service providers.
    These providers include, but are not limited to, couriers used
    to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to
    electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees.
    Failure by these providers, for any reason, to deliver their
    services in a timely manner could result in material
    interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and
    result in significant penalties or liabilities to us.

In the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan
    may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and
    adversely interrupt operations:

Our
    operations are dependent on our ability to protect our
    infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural
    disaster, unauthorized security breach, power loss,
    telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, or other events
    that could have a significant disruptive effect on our
    operations. We have a business continuity plan in place in the
    event of system failure due to any of these events. If the
    business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery
    scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience
    material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of
    services to our clients.



We may not be able to keep pace with changes in
    technology:

To maintain our growth strategy,
    we must adapt and respond to technological advances and
    technological requirements of our clients. Our future success
    will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase
    the performance of our internal use systems, particularly our
    systems that meet our clients’ requirements. We continue to
    make significant investments related to the development of new
    technology. If our systems become outdated, we may be at a
    disadvantage when competing in our industry. There can be no
    assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will
    be successful. If we do integrate and update our systems in a
    timely manner, or if our investments in technology fail to
    provide the expected results, there could be a material adverse
    effect to our business and results of operations.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits from
    acquisitions:

From time to time we acquire
    other companies. The effective integration of acquired companies
    may be difficult to achieve. It is also possible that we may not
    realize any or all expected benefits from acquisitions or
    achieve benefits from acquisitions in a timely manner. In
    addition, we may incur significant costs and management’s
    time and attention may be diverted from other parts of our
    business in connection with the integration of acquisitions.
    Failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could have
    a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We
    currently have no definitive agreements with respect to any
    material prospective acquisition.

We may have an adverse outcome of legal matters, which
    could harm our business:

We are subject to
    various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course
    of business. These include disputes or potential disputes
    related to breach of contract, employment-related claims, tax
    claims, and other matters. As of May 31, 2007, we have a
    reserve of $32.5 million for pending litigation. See
    Item 3 of this

Form 10-K

for additional disclosure. In light of the litigation reserve
    recorded, our management currently believes that resolution of
    outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on our financial position or results of our operations.
    However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
    there exists the possibility that their ultimate resolution
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial position
    and results of operations in the period in which any such effect
    is recorded.

We may experience a loss as the result of our clients
    having insufficient funds to cover payments we have made on
    their behalf to applicable tax or regulatory agencies and
    employees:

As part of the payroll processing
    service, we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from
    their bank accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies. It is possible that we
    would be held liable for such amounts in the event the client
    has insufficient funds to cover them. We have in the past, and
    may in the future, make payments on our clients’ behalf for
    which we are not reimbursed, resulting in a loss to us.

Our interest earned on funds held for clients may be
    impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the
    amount of tax withheld or timing of
    remittance:

We receive interest income from
    investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. A
    change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to
    be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable
    tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest
    income.

We may be exposed to additional risks related to our
    co-employment relationship within our PEO
    business:

Many federal and state laws that
    apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically
    address the obligations and responsibilities of the
    “co-employment” relationship. As a result, there is a
    possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations
    of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or
    omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our
    agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or
    violations. Although our agreements with the clients provide
    that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable
    to its own or its employees’ conduct, we may not be able to
    effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. In
    addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our
    employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the
    “employer” under any of the state or federal laws.

We may be exposed to additional risks related to foreign
    operations as a result of our business in
    Germany:

As of May 31, 2007, we serviced
    approximately 900 clients in Germany. As a result, our business
    is subject to political and economic instability unrelated to
    our operations in the U.S. Additionally, our business in
    Germany exposes us to currency fluctuations, and we must operate
    under legal and tax regulations that differ from those of the
    U.S. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency
    transactions due to the relatively insignificant amounts. Our
    entry into foreign operations requires a significant investment
    and management’s attention. There can be no



assurance that our investment in Germany will produce expected
    levels of revenue or that other factors noted previously will
    not harm our business.

    our regional, branch, and sales offices and data processing
    centers. These locations are concentrated in metropolitan areas.
    We believe that adequate, suitable lease space will continue to
    be available for our needs.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in
    the normal course of our business. These include disputes or
    potential disputes related to breach of contract,
    employment-related claims, tax claims, and other matters.

In August 2001, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,
    Rapid Payroll, Inc. (“Rapid Payroll”) informed
    76 licensees that it intended to stop supporting their
    payroll processing software in August of 2002. Thereafter,
    lawsuits were commenced by licensees asserting various claims,
    including breach of contract and related tort and fraud causes
    of action. As previously reported in the prior periodic reports,
    these lawsuits sought compensatory damages, punitive damages,
    and injunctive relief against Rapid Payroll, the Company, its
    former Chief Executive Officer, and its Senior Vice President of
    Sales and Marketing. In accordance with our indemnification
    agreements with our senior executives, the Company has agreed to
    defend and, if necessary, indemnify them in connection with
    these pending matters.

At the present time, the Company has fully resolved its
    licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with 74 of
    the 76 licensees who were provided services by Rapid Payroll. A
    decision favorable to Paychex, Inc. was issued by the United
    States District Court for the Central District of California
    with respect to the Company’s dispute with one of the
    remaining two licensees. That licensee is currently appealing
    the case. A verdict was issued on June 27, 2007 in
    litigation brought by the other remaining licensee. In that
    case, the California Superior Court, Los Angeles



County jury awarded to the plaintiff $15.0 million in
    compensatory damages and subsequently awarded an additional
    $11.0 million in punitive damages. The Company will seek to
    have the verdict reduced or reversed through post-trial motions
    and, if necessary, an appeal.

We have recorded a reserve for pending litigation matters. The
    litigation reserve has been adjusted in fiscal 2007 to account
    for settlements, increases in reserves, and incurred litigation
    expenditures. During fiscal 2007, we increased the litigation
    reserve by $38.0 million to account for settlements and for
    anticipated costs relating to pending litigation matters. Our
    reserve for all pending litigation totaled $32.5 million as
    of May 31, 2007, and is included in current liabilities on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In light of the reserve for all pending litigation matters, our
    management currently believes that resolution of outstanding
    legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position or results of operations. However, legal
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists
    the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters
    could have a material adverse impact on our financial position
    and the results of operations in the period in which any such
    effect is recorded.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders, through
    the solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the three

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under
    the symbol “PAYX.” Dividends have historically been
    paid on our common stock in August, November, February, and May.
    The level and continuation of future dividends are dependent on
    our future earnings and cash flows, and are subject to the
    discretion of the Board of Directors.

As of June 30, 2007, there were 17,268 holders of record of
    our common stock, which includes registered holders and
    participants in the Paychex, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and
    Stock Purchase Plan. There were also 9,134 participants in the

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations reviews the operating results of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“we,”
    “our,” or “us”) for each of the three fiscal
    years ended May 31, 2007 (“fiscal 2007”),
    May 31, 2006 (“fiscal 2006”), and May 31,
    2005 (“fiscal 2005”), and our financial condition as
    of May 31, 2007. This review should be read in conjunction
    with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the
    related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Form 10-K”)

and the “Risk Factors” discussed in Item 1A of
    this

Form 10-K.

Forward-looking statements in this review are qualified by the
    cautionary statement under the heading “Safe Harbor
    Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995” contained at the beginning of Part I of this

Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and
    integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing
    solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our Payroll and
    Human Resource Services offer a portfolio of services and
    products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll
    and human resource needs.

Our Payroll services are provided through either our Core
    Payroll or Major Market Services (“MMS”), which is
    utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and
    benefits needs, and include:

•

payroll processing;

•

payroll tax administration services;

•

employee payment services; and

•

other payroll-related services including regulatory compliance
    (new-hire reporting and garnishment processing).



Our Human Resource Services primarily include:

•

comprehensive human resource outsourcing services, which include
    Paychex
    Premier

SM

Human Resources (“Paychex Premier”) and our
    Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”);

•

retirement services administration;

•

workers’ compensation insurance services;

•

health and benefits services;

•

time and attendance solutions; and

•

other human resource services and products.

We mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services
    performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of
    clients, utilization of ancillary services, and checks or
    transactions per client per pay period. We also earn interest on
    funds held for clients between the time of collection from our
    clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. Our strategy is focused on
    achieving strong long-term financial performance while providing
    high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services, growing
    our client base, increasing utilization of our ancillary
    services, leveraging our technological and operating
    infrastructure, and expanding our service offerings.

Fiscal 2007 was our seventeenth consecutive year of record total
    revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Our
    financial results for fiscal 2007 included the following
    highlights:

•

Total revenue increased 13% to $1.9 billion.

•

Payroll service revenue increased 9% to $1.4 billion.

•

Human Resource Services revenue increased 22% to
    $396.2 million.

•

Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 11% to
    $515.4 million and $1.35 per share, respectively.

•

Cash flow from operations increased 11% to $631.2 million.

•

Dividends of $301.3 million were paid to stockholders,
    representing 58% of net income.

During fiscal 2007, we recorded an expense charge of
    $38.0 million to increase our litigation reserve, which
    reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.06 per share.
    Disputes involving Rapid Payroll, Inc. (“Rapid
    Payroll”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex, Inc.,
    arose in August 2001. These disputes resulted in litigation, as
    has been previously disclosed. At the present time, we have
    fully resolved our licensing responsibility and settled all
    litigation with 74 of the 76 licensees who were provided
    services by Rapid Payroll. A decision favorable to Paychex, Inc.
    was issued by the United States District Court for the Central
    District of California with respect to our dispute with one of
    the remaining two licensees. That licensee is currently
    appealing the case. A verdict was issued on June 27, 2007
    in litigation brought by the other remaining licensee. In that
    case, a California Superior Court, Los Angeles County jury
    awarded to the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory
    damages and subsequently awarded an additional
    $11.0 million in punitive damages. Refer to Note L of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for additional information on pending legal matters.

On June 1, 2006, we adopted the new accounting standard for
    stock-based compensation and recognized $25.7 million of
    related expense for fiscal 2007. Refer to the “Stock-Based
    Compensation Costs” section following this
    “Overview” section for additional information on
    stock-based compensation plans.

In managing and evaluating the results of our day-to-day
    operations, we believe that operating income excluding certain
    items is an appropriate measure. We also use this measure in
    evaluating management’s performance in generating those
    results. Operating income increased 8% to $701.5 million
    for fiscal 2007. Operating income excluding interest on funds
    held for clients, stock-based compensation costs, and the
    expense charge to increase the litigation reserve increased 15%
    to $631.1 million for fiscal 2007. Refer to the
    reconciliation of operating income to operating income excluding
    certain items included in “Operating Income” under the
    “Results of Operations” section of this review.



Our financial performance for fiscal 2007 was largely due to
    strong service revenue growth of 11% over the prior fiscal year.
    This growth in service revenue was attributable to client base
    growth, higher check volume, price increases, and growth in the
    utilization of our ancillary services.

Our financial performance was also positively impacted by the
    effects of increases in interest rates earned on funds held for
    clients and corporate investment portfolios. Our combined
    interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment
    income increased 40% for fiscal 2007 and earned an average rate
    of return of 4.0%, an increase from 3.2% for fiscal 2006 and
    2.2% for fiscal 2005. The Federal Funds rate was raised
    25 basis points in fiscal 2007 and was 5.25% as of
    May 31, 2007. The impact of changing interest rates and
    related risks is discussed in more detail in the “Market
    Risk Factors” section, contained in Item 7A of this

Form 10-K.

We continue to make investments in our business as part of our
    growth strategy. Some of these investments include the following:

Growing the client base and increasing utilization of
    ancillary services:

Our client base increased
    to approximately 561,000 clients as of May 31, 2007. This
    compares with approximately 543,000 clients as of May 31,
    2006, and approximately 522,000 clients as of May 31, 2005.
    Client growth was approximately 3.4% for fiscal 2007, compared
    with approximately 4.0% for fiscal 2006 and approximately 3.5%
    for fiscal 2005.

We have continued to invest in our direct sales force, as we
    believe there is opportunity for growth within our target market
    of small- to medium-sized businesses. The following table
    summarizes the approximate composition of our direct sales force:

We believe there are opportunities for growth within our current
    client base, as well as with new clients, through increased
    penetration of our payroll and human resource ancillary services
    and products. Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll
    processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating
    margin. The following statistics demonstrate the growth in our

Service and product initiatives:

During
    fiscal 2007, we made investments to broaden our portfolio of
    services and products and:

•

Enhanced our 401(k) recordkeeping service, allowing for greater
    flexibility in investment options. In addition, a Roth 401(k)
    investment option was introduced as part of our retirement
    services offering.

•

Continued with the expansion of our health insurance services
    nationwide, simplifying the process for our clients in obtaining
    coverage through our network of national and regional insurers.



•

Expanded our HR Online product and introduced our Paychex
    Premier service to MMS clients, both of which allow us to better
    serve these clients.

•

Expanded our employee benefit administration service offerings
    with the introduction of COBRA administration services and state
    continuation services, which meet federal and state mandates for
    temporary continuation of health care coverage for employees and
    their families.

Business acquisitions:

We may
    supplement our growth from time to time through strategic
    acquisitions when opportunities arise. We currently have no
    definitive agreements with respect to any material prospective
    acquisition.

Focus on customer service:

We have
    always focused on customer service and the maximization of
    client retention. For fiscal 2007, customer survey results were
    at an all-time high, and client retention was at a record level
    of slightly more than 80% of our beginning client base.

Financial position:

As of May 31,
    2007, we maintained a strong financial position with cash and
    total corporate investments of $1.2 billion. Our primary
    source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from
    operations increased 11% to $631.2 million for fiscal 2007.
    Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases,
    and dividend payments from our operating activities. It is
    anticipated that cash and current corporate investment balances
    of $591.1 million as of May 31, 2007, along with
    projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business
    operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the
    foreseeable future.

For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal
    years 2007, 2006, and 2005, and our financial position as of
    May 31, 2007, refer to the tables and analysis in the
    “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and
    Capital Resources” sections of this Item 7 and the
    discussion in the “Critical Accounting Policies”
    section of this Item 7.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Costs

Effective June 1, 2006 (the “adoption date”), we
    adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
    (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004)
    (“SFAS No. 123 (R)”), “Share-Based
    Payment.” This statement requires that all stock-based
    awards to employees, including grants of stock options, be
    recognized as compensation costs in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of
    grant. These costs are recognized as expense in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income over the requisite service period. We
    adopted this standard using the modified-prospective transition
    method, and accordingly, results for the prior periods have not
    been restated. Comparisons between the results of operations for
    fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 are impacted by this method of
    adoption. Refer to Note B of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for additional information regarding stock-based compensation
    arrangements.

Prior to the adoption date, we accounted for stock-based
    compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method
    described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
    related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”
    Accordingly, no compensation costs were recognized for stock
    option grants because the exercise price of the stock options
    granted was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on
    the date of the grant.



The impacts to the results of operations from recognition of
    stock-based compensation costs under SFAS No. 123 (R)
    are as follows:

As of May 31, 2007, the total unrecognized compensation
    cost for all unvested stock-based awards was $60.7 million
    and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
    of 2.7 years. The impact on future periods may change based
    on the issuance of additional stock-based awards as allowed
    under the Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended
    and restated effective October 12, 2005.

For grants of stock options, we estimate the fair value at the
    date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For
    grants of restricted stock, which were first granted in July
    2006, the fair value is equal to the closing market price of the
    underlying common stock as of the date of grant. Stock-based
    compensation costs for any awards granted subsequent to the
    adoption date are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
    requisite service period to better align the costs with the
    employee services provided. Compensation costs for stock-based
    awards granted prior to the adoption date will continue to be
    recognized on an accelerated amortization schedule related to
    the graded vesting terms of the grant.

As part of the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), we
    did an in-depth review of all of our assumptions used in
    calculating the fair value under a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. For grants subsequent to the adoption date, we calculated
    the estimated volatility factor based on a combination of
    historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied
    market volatility. We incorporated implied volatility as it is
    generally more reflective of both historical volatility and
    expectations of how future volatility will differ from
    historical volatility. Prior to the adoption date, we used
    historical volatility based on monthly stock prices. The
    expected option life of our stock option grants is determined
    from historical exercise behavior.

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), we are
    required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation
    costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Previously, in
    our pro-forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, we
    accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Our assumptions for
    forfeitures were determined based on type of award and
    historical experience.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to types or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions can have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in our results of operations.



Outlook

Our current outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2008
    (“fiscal 2008”) is based upon current economic and
    interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes.
    Projected revenue and net income growth is as follows:

The effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately

    expected to be in the range of $80 million to
    $85 million. Fiscal 2008 depreciation expense is projected
    to be approximately $65 million, and we project
    amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2008 to be
    approximately $17 million. We estimate that the earnings
    effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates
    (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at the
    beginning of fiscal 2008 would be in the range of
    $5.0 million to $5.5 million for fiscal 2008.

Revenue:

Payroll service revenue
    increased 9% for fiscal 2007 and 10% for fiscal 2006 to
    $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The
    increases in Payroll service revenue were primarily attributable
    to client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and
    growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services.

As of May 31, 2007, 93% of all clients utilized our payroll
    tax administration services, compared with 92% as of
    May 31, 2006 and 90% as of May 31, 2005. We believe
    our client utilization percentage of these services is near
    maturity. Our employee payment services were utilized by 71% of
    our clients as of May 31, 2007, compared with 68% as of
    May 31, 2006 and 65% as of May 31, 2005. Nearly all
    new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and
    more than 80% of new clients select a form of our employee
    payment services.

Human Resource Services revenue increased 22% for fiscal 2007
    and 29% for fiscal 2006 to $396.2 million and
    $324.9 million, respectively. Revenue from time and
    attendance products, included in Human Resource Services,
    increased 15% for fiscal 2007 and 144% for fiscal 2006 to
    $17.2 million and $15.0 million, respectively.
    Additionally, growth was generated from the following:

•

Retirement services client base increased 16% to 44,000 clients
    for fiscal 2007 and 15% to 38,000 clients for fiscal 2006;

•

Comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client
    employees increased 26% to 373,000 client employees served for
    fiscal 2007 and 31% to 295,000 client employees served for
    fiscal 2006;



•

Workers’ compensation insurance client base increased 19%
    to 62,000 clients for fiscal 2007 and 18% to 52,000 clients for
    fiscal 2006;

•

The asset value of the retirement services client
    employees’ funds increased 34% to $8.5 billion for
    fiscal 2007 and 25% to $6.3 billion for fiscal 2006.

The increase in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal
    2007 compared to fiscal 2006, and for fiscal 2006 compared to
    fiscal 2005 was the result of higher average interest rates
    earned and higher average portfolio balances. The higher average
    portfolio balances in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were
    driven by client base growth, wage inflation, check volume
    growth within our current client base, and increased utilization
    of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment
    services. See the “Market Risk Factors” section,
    contained in Item 7A of this

Form 10-K,

Stock-based compensation costs from the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123 (R), included in
    compensation-related expenses, were $25.7 million for
    fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we recorded an expense charge
    of $38.0 million to increase our litigation reserve to
    account for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to
    pending legal matters. Refer to Note L of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K,

for additional information on pending legal matters.

The stock-based compensation costs and the expense charge to
    increase the litigation reserve accounted for 7% of the 16%
    increase in total expenses for fiscal 2007. Most of the
    remaining increase for fiscal 2007 and the increase for fiscal
    2006 were accounted for by increases in personnel and other
    costs related to retaining clients, promoting new services, and
    creating more efficient systems for selling and servicing
    through new and enhanced technology. In addition, for fiscal
    2006, total expenses were affected by a strong sales year as our
    sales force exceeded its targets resulting in higher than normal
    levels of sales expense. As of May 31, 2007, we had
    approximately 11,700 employees compared with
    approximately 10,900 as of May 31, 2006 and 10,000 as
    of May 31, 2005.

Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings,
    furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software.
    Increases in depreciation expense were due to higher levels of
    capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued
    to grow our business. Amortization of intangible assets is
    primarily related to client lists obtained from previous
    acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or
    accelerated methods. Amortization increased in fiscal 2007
    mainly due to the termination of our client-servicing
    arrangement with New England Business Services, Inc.
    (“NEBS

®

”)
    and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients.
    Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and
    supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional
    services, and other costs incurred to support our business.

Operating Income:

Operating income
    growth was 8% for fiscal 2007 and 22% for fiscal 2006. The
    increases in operating income for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006
    were attributable to the factors previously discussed.

In managing and evaluating the results of our day-to-day
    operations, we believe that operating income excluding certain
    items is an appropriate measure. We also use this measure in
    evaluating management’s performance in generating those
    results. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for
    clients, stock-



based compensation costs, and the expense charge to increase the
    litigation reserve is as follows for the year ended May 31:

Investment Income, Net:

Investment
    income, net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash
    equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities.
    Investment income does not include interest on funds held for
    clients, which is included in total revenue. The increase in
    investment income for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, and
    for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005, is mainly due to
    higher average interest rates earned and higher average
    portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated
    from ongoing operations.

Income Taxes:

Our effective income tax
    rate was 30.7% for fiscal 2007, compared with 31.1% for fiscal
    2006, and 32.5% for fiscal 2005. The decreases in our effective
    income tax rate were primarily the result of higher levels of
    tax-exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal
    debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate
    investment portfolios, and a lower effective state income tax
    rate. For fiscal 2007, the effective tax rate was impacted by
    non-deductible compensation related to incentive stock option
    grants. See Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for additional disclosures on income taxes.

Net Income:

Net income growth was 11%
    for fiscal 2007 and 26% for fiscal 2006 to $515.4 million
    and $464.9 million, respectively. These increases were
    attributable to the factors previously discussed, including, in
    fiscal 2007, the increase to the litigation reserve of
    $38.0 million and the $25.7 million of stock-based
    compensation costs due to the June 1, 2006 accounting
    standard adoption.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

As of May 31, 2007, we had $1.2 billion in cash and
    total corporate investments. Cash and current corporate
    investments of $591.1 million and projected operating cash
    flows are expected to support our normal business operations,
    capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable
    future.

In July 2007, we declared our regular quarterly dividend of
    $0.30 per share, an increase of 43% from $0.21 per share. At the
    same time, we announced our intention to repurchase up to
    $1.0 billion of Paychex, Inc. common stock.

Commitments
    and Contractual Obligations

We have unused borrowing capacity available under four
    uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market rates
    of interest with financial institutions as follows:

Financial institution

Expiration date

JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.

$250 million

February 2008

PNC Bank, National Association

$150 million

February 2008

Wells Fargo Bank, National
    Association

$150 million

February 2008

Our credit facilities are evidenced by Promissory Notes and are
    secured by separate Pledge Security Agreements by and between
    Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the
    “Lenders”), pursuant to which we have granted each of
    the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment
    securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
    custody account pursuant to the terms of a Control Agreement and
    is to be



administered under an Intercreditor Agreement among the Lenders.
    Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that
    collateral be transferred from the pooled account into
    segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
    short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
    overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from
    electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the
    ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were
    outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2007 or
    as of May 31, 2007.

As of May 31, 2007, we had irrevocable standby letters of
    credit outstanding totaling $62.4 million, required to
    secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies. These
    letters of credit expire at various dates between December 2007
    and July 2008. The letters are secured by securities held in our
    corporate investment portfolio, including a $53.5 million
    letter of credit for which funds have been segregated into a
    separate account. No amounts were outstanding on these letters
    of credit during fiscal 2007 or as of May 31, 2007.

We have entered into various operating leases and purchase
    obligations that, under United States generally accepted
    accounting principles (“GAAP”), are not reflected on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2007. The
    table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations
    under these commitments, as well as other contractual
    obligations shown as other liabilities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2007:

Advantage has license agreements with independently owned
    associate offices (“Associates”), which are
    responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services
    and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex,
    Inc. and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll
    processing and payroll tax administration services. Under these
    arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates commissions based on
    processing activity for the related clients. Since the actual
    amounts of future payments are uncertain, obligations under
    these arrangements are not included in the table above.
    Commission expense for the Associates for fiscal 2007 and fiscal
    2006 was $15.2 million and $14.5 million, respectively.

We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance
    contracts for clients who financed their service contracts
    through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make
    representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of
    services under service arrangements with clients.  In addition,
    we have entered into indemnification agreements with our
    officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if
    necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or
    future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to
    us. Historically, there have been no material losses related to
    such guarantees and indemnifications.



We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various
    insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans.
    Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements
    is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been
    material. We have insurance coverage in addition to our
    purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for
    employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty
    liability, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles
    and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance
    company.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in
    transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special
    purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would
    have been established for the purpose of facilitating
    off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do
    maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing
    projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations.
    These investments are accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting.

The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 and
    fiscal 2006 reflects higher net income adjusted for non-cash
    items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The
    increase in non-cash adjustments to net income for fiscal 2007
    was primarily attributable to stock-based compensation costs of
    $25.7 million and the expense charge of $38.0 million
    to increase the litigation reserve. The fluctuations in our
    operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily
    related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and
    collection, and timing of payments for compensation, PEO
    payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.

Funds held for clients and corporate
    investments:

Funds held for clients are
    primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale
    securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of
    available-for-sale securities. The portfolio of funds held for
    clients and corporate investments is detailed in Note D of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the
    timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of
    funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax
    administration services and to employees of clients utilizing
    employee payment services. Fluctuations in net funds held for
    clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to
    timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of corporate
    investments. Additional discussion of interest rates and related
    risks is included in the “Market Risk Factors”
    section, contained in Item 7A of this

Form 10-K.



Purchases of long-lived assets:

To
    support our continued client and ancillary product growth,
    purchases of property and equipment were made for data
    processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and
    upgrade of various operating facilities. Construction in
    progress totaled $46.5 million and $36.3 million as of
    May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of these costs,
    $39.5 million and $29.4 million represent software
    being developed for internal use as of May 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Capitalization of costs ceases when the
    software is ready for its intended use, at which time we will
    begin amortization of the costs.

During fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005, we purchased
    approximately $2.8 million, $4.6 million, and
    $2.5 million, respectively, of data processing equipment
    and software from EMC Corporation. The Chairman, President, and
    Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our
    Board of Directors (the “Board.”) Other assets
    increased for fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our
    client-servicing arrangement with NEBS and the purchasing of the
    right to service the related clients.

In October 2006, our
    Board approved an increase of 31% in the quarterly dividend
    payment to $0.21 per share from $0.16 per share. In October
    2005, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend
    payment to $0.16 per share from $0.13 per share. The dividends
    paid as a percentage of net income totaled 58%, 50%, and 52% for
    fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005, respectively. The
    payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings
    and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board.

Exercise of stock options:

The increase
    in proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2007
    compared with fiscal 2006, and for fiscal 2006 compared with
    fiscal 2005, was primarily due to an increase in the number of
    stock options exercised and an increase in the average exercise
    price per share. Common shares acquired through exercise of
    stock options for fiscal 2007 were 1.8 million shares
    compared with 1.7 million shares for fiscal 2006 and
    0.7 million shares for fiscal 2005. We have recognized an
    excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of
    $9.7 million for fiscal 2007 that is reflected in cash
    flows from financing activities in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123 (R), as adopted on June 1, 2006. For
    fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, we recognized tax benefits related
    to exercise of stock options of $11.6 million and
    $4.5 million, respectively, that are reflected in cash
    flows from operating activities. See Note B to the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K,

for additional disclosures on our stock incentive plans.

Other

New accounting pronouncements:

In June
    2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 48
    (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109,” to create a single model to address
    accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48
    clarifies the accounting for income tax by prescribing a minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before
    being recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
    FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
    in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2006. We will adopt FIN 48 as of June 1, 2007, as
    required. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this
    interpretation and its guidance on application, we currently
    estimate the adoption of FIN 48 will increase the reserve
    for unrecognized tax positions by approximately
    $8.0 million, primarily related to state income tax
    matters. This increase will be recorded as a decrease to opening
    retained earnings as of June 1, 2007. The adoption of
    FIN 48 is also expected to impact our effective income tax
    rate for fiscal 2008, increasing it by approximately
    50 basis points.



In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. FIN 48-1,

“Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48.” This FSP amends FIN 48 to provide
    guidance that a company may recognize a previously unrecognized
    tax benefit if the tax position is effectively (as opposed to
    “ultimately”) settled through examination,
    negotiation, or litigation. We will apply the guidance in this
    FSP upon adoption of FIN 48 in June 2007.

In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP FIN 46(R)-6,
    “Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying
    FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).” This FSP provides
    additional guidance on the determination of and accounting for
    variable interests under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).
    This FSP was effective for reporting periods beginning after
    June 15, 2006, and we implemented its guidance beginning in
    the second quarter of fiscal 2007 relative to our limited
    partner investments in low-income housing projects. The adoption
    of this FSP did not have a material effect on our results of
    operations or financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” This statement clarifies
    the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have not yet
    determined the effect, if any, the adoption of this statement
    will have on our results of operations or financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Post-Retirement Plans.” This statement requires an
    employer to recognize the over-funded or under-funded status of
    a defined benefit post-retirement plan and to recognize changes
    in the funded status in the year of change through comprehensive
    income. The statement is effective as of the end of the fiscal
    year ending after December 15, 2006. We currently do not
    have any benefit plans subject to this new statement and,
    therefore, expect no impact on our results of operations or
    financial position.

In October 2006, the FASB issued FSPs related to
    SFAS No. 123 (R) as follows:

•

FAS 123 (R)-5, “Amendment of FASB Staff Position 123
    (R)-1;” and

•

FAS 123 (R)-6, “Technical Corrections of FASB
    Statement No. 123 (R).”

Both FSPs are effective in the first reporting period beginning
    after the date the FSP is posted to the FASB website, which for
    us was the three months ended February 28, 2007. The
    adoption of these FSPs did not have a material effect on our
    results of operations or financial position.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment to FASB Statement
    No. 115.” This statement allows a company to
    irrevocably elect fair value as a measurement attribute for
    certain financial assets and financial liabilities with changes
    in fair value recognized in the results of operations. The
    statement also establishes presentation and disclosure
    requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between
    companies that choose different measurement attributes for
    similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. We currently do not expect this statement to have a
    material effect on our results of operations or financial
    position.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained
    in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex, Inc.
    Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
    The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
    make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an
    ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates
    used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base
    our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and
    assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and
    circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from
    these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed
    critical to our results of operations or financial position are
    discussed below.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenue is
    recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
    service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
    or determinable and collectibility is reasonably



assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual
    service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the
    annual service period. Our service revenue is largely
    attributable to payroll-related processing services where the
    fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed
    amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or
    transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service
    for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and
    reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for
    delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net
    of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes,
    benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct
    costs billed and incurred were $2.6 billion,
    $2.4 billion, and $2.2 billion for fiscal 2007, 2006,
    and 2005, respectively.

Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized
    using the residual method when all of the following are present:
    persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, typically a
    non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the
    software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free
    of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in
    conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance
    solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is
    recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

In certain situations we allow a client a right of return or
    refund. We maintain an allowance for returns, which is based on
    historical data. The allowance is reviewed periodically for
    adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in the results
    of operations for the period in which the adjustment is
    identified.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
    that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
    administration services and for employee payment services, and
    invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are
    typically remitted up to 30 days after receipt, with some
    items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these
    funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and
    remittance of these funds are critical components of providing
    these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
    net realized gains and losses from the sales of
    available-for-sale securities.

PEO workers’ compensation
    insurance:

Workers’ compensation
    insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated
    costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves
    include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those
    claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain
    expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In
    establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves,
    we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future
    cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
    and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
    actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
    multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes
    in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could
    materially impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may
    vary from our present estimates, particularly when those
    payments may not occur until well into the future.

We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’
    compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously
    established reserves are reflected in the results of operations
    for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such
    adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
    variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

In fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, workers’ compensation
    insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on
    claims paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims liability
    was $750,000 under both the fiscal 2007 policy and the fiscal
    2006 policy.



We had recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation claims as of:

Valuation of investments:

Our
    investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at
    market value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the
    market value of investments and unrealized losses related to
    decreases in the market value are included in comprehensive
    income, net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements
    of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the market
    value of investments impact our net income only when such
    investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains
    and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific
    identification of the security’s cost basis. On our
    Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses
    from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds
    held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from
    corporate investments are included in investment income, net.

We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our
    available-for-sale securities from the possible inability of
    borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to
    mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality
    securities with AAA and AA ratings, and short-term securities
    with an

A-1

rating, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any
    single issuer. We periodically review our investment portfolio
    to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily
    impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential
    valuation concerns, which would require us to record an
    impairment charge in the period any such determination is made.
    In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the
    duration and extent to which the market value of an investment
    is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in
    credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to
    hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery
    or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not
    other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due
    to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption
    related to any particular investment.

Goodwill and intangible assets:

For
    business combinations, we assign estimated fair values to all
    assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets,
    such as customer lists, certain license agreements, trade names,
    and non-compete agreements. The assignment of fair values to
    acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful
    lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires
    significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions. For certain
    fixed assets, including software and intangible assets, we use
    the assistance of independent valuation consultants. The
    remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned
    to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

We have $407.7 million of goodwill recorded on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2007, resulting
    from acquisitions during the fiscal years ended May 31,
    2003, 2004, and 2007. SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,” requires that goodwill not be
    amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis
    and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances
    change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential
    decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is
    determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We
    perform our annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter. Our
    business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially
    all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. Based
    on the results of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment
    loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2007
    or fiscal 2006. Subsequent to this review, there have been no
    events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment
    of our goodwill balance.

We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable.

Accrual for client fund losses:

We
    maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our
    clients’ inability to meet their payroll obligations. As
    part of providing payroll, payroll tax administration services,
    and employee payment services, we are authorized by the client
    to initiate money transfers from the client’s account for
    the amount of tax obligations and employees’ direct
    deposits. Electronic money fund transfers from client bank



accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from
    clients’ insufficient funds to cover such transfers. We
    evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and
    analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically
    reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the
    clients.

Contingent liabilities:

We are subject
    to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal
    course of business. As of May 31, 2007, we had
    approximately $32.5 million of reserves for pending
    litigation. Based on the application of SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies,” which requires us to
    record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is
    probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably
    estimated, we deem this amount adequate. The determination of
    whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the
    amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires
    considerable judgment. This reserve may change in the future due
    to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions
    related to any particular matter. In light of the litigation
    reserve recorded, we currently believe that resolution of these
    matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position or results of operations. However, these matters are
    subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the
    possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could
    have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our
    results of operations in the period in which any such effect is
    recorded. For additional information regarding pending legal
    matters, refer to Note L in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Stock-based compensation
    costs:

Effective June 1, 2006, we
    adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), which requires that all
    stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock
    options, be recognized as compensation costs in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of
    the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option
    grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model
    requires various assumptions as inputs including expected
    volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life.
    We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical
    volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market
    volatility, both over a period equal to the expected option
    life. We estimate expected option life based on historical
    exercise behavior.

Under SFAS No. 123 (R), we are required to
    estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for
    those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for
    forfeitures were determined based on type of award and
    historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at
    the point in time a significant change is identified with any

catch-up

adjustment recorded in the period of change, with the final
    adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal
    actual forfeitures.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in our results of operations.

We have determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
    as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application,
    is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option
    grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our
    choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model
    if additional information becomes available in the future
    indicating that another model would provide a more accurate
    estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants
    would warrant such a change.

Income taxes:

We account for deferred
    taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
    included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax
    returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are determined based on the difference between the financial
    statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
    tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123
    (R) in fiscal 2007, we record a deferred tax asset related to
    the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain
    stock-based awards. At the time of exercise of non-qualified
    stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards, we account
    for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income
    tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any
    excess tax benefit increasing additional paid-in capital. We
    currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in
    additional paid-in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefit
    related to stock-based awards.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk Factors

Changes in interest rates and interest rate
    risk:

Funds held for clients are primarily
    comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities.
    Corporate investments are primarily comprised of
    available-for-sale securities. As a result of our operating and
    investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest
    rates that may materially effect our results of operations and
    financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the
    earnings potential of future investments and will cause
    fluctuations in the market value of our longer-term
    available-for-sale securities. In seeking to minimize the risks

and/or

costs
    associated with such activities, we generally direct investments
    towards high credit quality, fixed-rate municipal and government
    securities and manage the available-for-sale securities to a
    benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years. We do not
    utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest
    rate risk.

Our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios
    have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates. During
    fiscal 2007, the average interest rate earned on our combined
    funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was
    4.0% compared with 3.2% for fiscal 2006 and 2.2% for fiscal
    2005. Short-term rates rose steadily throughout fiscal 2006,
    with the Federal Funds rate increasing 200 basis points to
    5.00% as of May 31, 2006. The Federal Funds rate increased
    25 basis points in fiscal 2007 and was 5.25% as of
    May 31, 2007. While interest rates are rising, the full
    benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be
    reflected in net income due to the interaction of long- and
    short-term interest rate changes as discussed below.

During a rising interest rate environment, the increases in
    interest rates increase earnings from our short-term
    investments, and over time will increase earnings from our
    longer-term available-for-sale securities. Earnings from the
    available-for-sale securities, which as of May 31, 2007 had
    an average duration of 2.5 years, excluding the impact of
    auction rate securities and VRDNs that are tied to short-term
    interest rates, would not reflect increases in interest rates
    until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are
    reinvested at higher rates.

The cost and market value of available-for-sale securities that
    have stated maturities as of May 31, 2007 are shown below
    by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from
    contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to
    prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

VRDNs and auction rate securities are primarily categorized as
    due after five years in the table above as the contractual
    maturities on these securities are typically 20 to
    30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-
    term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term
    instruments because of the liquidity provided through the
    auction or tender feature.

Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates
    involves many factors. These factors include, but are not
    limited to:

•

daily interest rate changes;

•

seasonal variations in investment balances;

•

actual duration of short-term and available-for-sale securities;

•

the proportional mix of taxable and tax-exempt
    investments; and

•

changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment
    rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous.

Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change in taxable
    interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates
    by approximately 17 basis points.

Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and
    corporate investments) averaged approximately $4.4 billion
    for fiscal 2007. Our normal and anticipated allocation is
    approximately 60% invested in short-term securities and
    available-for-sale securities with an average duration of
    35 days, and 40% invested in available-for-sale securities
    with an average duration of two and one-half to three years.

The combined funds held for clients and corporate
    available-for-sale securities reflected a net unrealized loss
    position of $14.9 million as of May 31, 2007, compared
    with a net unrealized loss position of $22.0 million as of
    May 31, 2006. During fiscal 2007, the net unrealized loss
    position ranged from $29.5 million to $1.1 million.
    During fiscal 2006, the net unrealized loss position ranged from
    $25.2 million to $6.1 million. The net unrealized loss
    position of our investment portfolios was approximately
    $19.2 million as of July 13, 2007.

As of May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, we had
    $5.0 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, invested
    in available-for-sale securities at market value. Excluding
    auction rate securities and VRDNs classified as
    available-for-sale securities which are tied to short-term
    interest rates, the weighted-average yields to maturity were
    3.7% and 3.0%, as of May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006,
    respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both
    short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis
    points, the resulting potential decrease in market value for our
    portfolio of securities as of May 31, 2007, would be
    approximately $12.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding
    decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase
    in market value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the
    market value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment
    to the portfolio’s recorded value, with an offsetting
    amount recorded in stockholders’ equity. These fluctuations
    in market value would have no related or immediate impact on the
    results of operations, unless any declines in market value were
    considered to be other-than-temporary.

Credit risk:

We are exposed to credit
    risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities from
    the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their
    bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily
    in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and
    short-term securities with an

A-1

rating,
    and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single
    issuer.

REPORT ON
    MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Paychex, Inc. (the “Company”) is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system
    of internal control over financial reporting as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Our internal control over
    financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits
    and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
    guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified
    personnel, and a written Code of Business Conduct adopted by our
    Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to all Company
    Directors and all officers and employees of our Company.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
    even when determined to be effective, can only provide
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

The Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors
    meets with the independent public accountants, management, and
    internal auditors periodically to discuss internal control over
    financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting
    matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent public
    accountants the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit
    Committee also meets periodically with the independent public
    accountants and the chief internal auditor without management
    present to ensure that the independent public accountants and
    the chief internal auditor have free access to the Audit
    Committee. The Audit Committee’s Report can be found in the
    Definitive Proxy Statement to be issued in connection with the
    Company’s 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
    2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
    set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission in “Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework.” Based on our assessment, management
    believes that the Company maintained effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of May 31, 2007.

The Company’s independent public accountants,
    Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting
    firm, are appointed by its Audit Committee. Ernst &
    Young LLP has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial
    Statements of Paychex, Inc., management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting and the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the
    independent public accountants are contained in this Annual
    Report on

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Audit Committee of the Board of Directors

and the Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Paychex, Inc. as of May 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
    Paychex, Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Paychex, Inc. at May 31, 2007 and
    2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial
    statements, on June 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based
    Payment.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Paychex, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    July 12, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Audit Committee of the Board of Directors

and the Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting, that Paychex, Inc. (the
    Company) maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of May 31, 2007, based on criteria established
    in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Paychex Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment about
    the effectiveness over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Paychex, Inc.
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of May 31, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
    Paychex, Inc. maintained in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
    2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Paychex, Inc. as of May 31,
    2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, stockholders’ equity, and the cash flows for each
    of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2007, and
    our report dated July 12, 2007, expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A —

Description
    of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Paychex, Inc.
    and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company” or
    “Paychex”) is a leading provider of comprehensive
    payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits
    outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses in
    the United States (“U.S.”). The Company also has a
    subsidiary in Germany.

Paychex, a Delaware corporation formed in 1979, reports one
    segment based upon the provision of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 131,
    “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information.” Substantially all of the Company’s
    revenue is generated within the U.S. The Company also
    generates revenue within Germany, which was less than one
    percent of its total revenue for the years ended May 31,
    2007 (“fiscal 2007”) and 2006 (“fiscal
    2006”). Long-lived assets in Germany are insignificant in
    relation to total long-lived assets of the Company as of
    May 31, 2007.

Total revenue is comprised of service revenue and interest on
    funds held for clients. Service revenue is comprised of the
    Payroll and Human Resource Services portfolios of services and
    products. Payroll service revenue is earned primarily from
    payroll processing, payroll tax administration services,
    employee payment services, and other ancillary services. Payroll
    processing services include the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; preparation of
    federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
    and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations.

In connection with the automated payroll tax administration
    services, the Company collects payroll taxes electronically from
    clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepares and
    files the applicable tax returns, and remits taxes to the
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due
    dates. These collections from clients are typically paid between
    one and 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to
    90 days. The Company handles all regulatory correspondence,
    amendments, and penalty and interest disputes, and is subject to
    cash penalties imposed by tax or regulatory agencies for late
    filings and late or under payment of taxes. With employee
    payment services, employers are offered the option of paying
    their employees by direct deposit, Paychex Access
    Visa

®

Card, a check drawn on a Paychex account
    (Readychex

®

),
    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by Paychex. For the first three methods,
    net payroll is collected electronically from the clients’
    bank account, typically one day before payday, and provides
    payment to the employee on payday.

In addition to service fees paid by clients, the Company earns
    interest on funds held for clients that are collected before due
    dates and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or
    regulatory agencies or client employees. The funds held for
    clients and related client deposit liability are included in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as current assets and current
    liabilities. The amount of funds held for clients and related
    client deposit liability varies significantly during the year.

The Human Resource Services service and product line provides
    small- to medium-sized businesses with retirement services
    administration, workers’ compensation insurance services,
    health and benefit services, time and attendance solutions,
    employee benefits administration, and other human resource
    services and products. The Company’s Paychex
    Premier

SM

Human Resource Services (“Paychex Premier”) provides a
    combined package of services that include payroll, employer
    compliance, human resource and employee benefits administration,
    risk management outsourcing, and the

on-site

availability of a professionally trained human resource services
    representative. This comprehensive bundle of services is
    designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
    payroll and related benefits costs while providing a benefits
    package equal to that of larger companies. The Company also
    operates a Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”),
    which provides primarily the same services as Paychex Premier,
    except Paychex serves as a co-employer of the clients’
    employees, assumes the risks and rewards of workers’
    compensation insurance, and provides more sophisticated health
    care offerings to PEO clients.

Principles of consolidation:

The
    Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash and
    cash equivalents consist of available cash, money market
    securities, and other investments with a maturity of three
    months or less as of the balance sheet date. Amounts reported in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value.

Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful
    accounts:

Accounts receivable balances are
    shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts of $3.3 million as of May 31,
    2007 and $2.5 million as of May 31, 2006. Amounts
    reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair
    value. No single client had a material impact on total accounts
    receivable, service revenue, or results of operations.

Funds held for clients and corporate
    investments:

Marketable securities included
    in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist
    primarily of securities classified as available-for-sale and are
    recorded at market value obtained from an independent pricing
    service. Funds held for clients also includes cash, money market
    securities, and short-term investments. Unrealized gains and
    losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported as
    comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Realized gains and losses on the
    sales of securities are determined by specific identification of
    the cost basis of each security. On the Consolidated Statements
    of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients
    are included in interest on funds held for clients and realized
    gains and losses from corporate investments are included in
    investment income, net.

Concentrations:

Substantially all of
    the Company’s deposited cash is maintained at two large
    credit-worthy financial institutions. These deposits may exceed
    the amount of any insurance provided. All of the Company’s
    deliverable securities are held in custody with one of the two
    aforementioned financial institutions, for which that
    institution bears the risk of custodial loss. Non-deliverable
    securities, primarily time deposits and money market securities,
    are restricted to credit-worthy broker-dealers and financial
    institutions.

Property and equipment, net of accumulated
    depreciation:

Property and equipment is
    stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
    Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of property
    and equipment using the straight-line method. The estimated
    useful lives of depreciable assets are generally ten to
    35 years, or the remaining life, whichever is shorter, for
    buildings and improvements; two to seven years for data
    processing equipment; three to five years for software; seven
    years for furniture and fixtures; and ten years or the life of
    the lease, whichever is shorter, for leasehold improvements.
    Normal and recurring repair and maintenance costs are charged to
    expense as incurred. The Company reviews the carrying value of
    property and equipment, including capitalized software, for
    impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.

Software development and
    enhancements:

Expenditures for software
    purchases and software developed for internal use are
    capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives, which are generally three to five years,
    except for substantial changes in the functionality of
    processing applications, for which the estimated useful life may
    be longer. For software developed for internal use, costs are
    capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use.” Capitalized internal use
    software costs include external direct costs of materials and
    services associated with developing or obtaining the software,
    and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are
    directly associated with internal-use software projects.
    Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at
    which the project is substantially complete and ready for its
    intended use. Costs associated with preliminary project stage
    activities, training, maintenance, and other post-implementation
    stage activities are expensed as incurred. The carrying value of
    software and development costs, along with other long-lived
    assets, is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets
    may not be recoverable.

Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated
    amortization:

The Company has recorded
    goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of businesses
    during the years ended May 31, 2003 (“fiscal
    2003”), May 31, 2004 (“fiscal 2004”), and
    during fiscal 2007. Under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,” goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual
    basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
    circumstances change in a way to indicate a potential decline in
    the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The
    Company’s business is largely homogeneous and, as a result,
    substantially all the goodwill is associated with one reporting
    unit. The Company performs its annual impairment testing in its
    fiscal fourth quarter. Based on the Company’s review, no
    impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for
    fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006.

Intangible assets are primarily comprised of client list
    acquisitions and license agreements with independently owned
    associate offices and are reported net of accumulated
    amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Intangible
    assets are amortized over periods generally ranging from five to
    twelve years using either straight-line, an accelerated method,
    or based on client attrition. The Company tests intangible
    assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be
    recoverable.

Other long-term assets:

Other long-term
    assets are primarily related to the Company’s investment as
    a limited partner in various low-income housing partnerships.
    These partnerships were determined to be variable interest
    entities as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46(R),
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” The
    Company is not the primary beneficiary of these variable
    interest entities and, therefore, does not consolidate them in
    its results of operations and financial position. The
    investments in these partnerships are accounted for under the
    equity method, with the Company’s share of partnership
    losses recorded in investment income, net on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. The net investment in these entities
    recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was
    $3.5 million as of May 31, 2007 and $4.5 million
    as of May 31, 2006.

Accrual for client fund losses:

The
    Company maintains an accrual for estimated losses associated
    with its clients’ inability to meet their payroll
    obligations. As part of providing payroll, payroll tax
    administration services, and employee payment services, the
    Company is authorized by the client to initiate money transfers
    from the client’s account for the amount of tax obligations
    and employees’ direct deposits. Electronic money fund
    transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential
    risk of loss resulting from clients’ insufficient funds to
    cover such transfers. The Company evaluates certain uncollected
    amounts on a specific basis and analyzes historical experience
    for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the
    likelihood of recovery from the clients.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenue is
    recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
    service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
    or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Certain processing services are provided under annual service
    arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
    service period. The Company’s service revenue is largely
    attributable to payroll-related processing services where the
    fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed
    amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or
    transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service
    for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and
    reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the
    delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net
    of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes,
    benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct
    costs billed and incurred were $2.6 billion,
    $2.4 billion, and $2.2 billion for fiscal 2007, fiscal
    2006, and the year ended May 31, 2005
    (“fiscal 2005”), respectively.

Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized
    using the residual method when all of the following are present:
    persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, typically a
    non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the
    software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free
    of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by the
    Company’s clients in conjunction with their purchase of
    certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these
    maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the
    contract.

In certain situations the Company allows a client a right of
    return or refund. The Company maintains an allowance for
    returns, which is based on historical data. The allowance is
    reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to
    revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in
    which the adjustment is identified.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
    that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
    administration services and for employee payment services, and
    invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are
    typically remitted up to 30 days after receipt, with some
    items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these
    funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and
    remittance of these funds are critical components of providing
    these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
    net realized gains and losses from the sales of
    available-for-sale securities.

Advantage Payroll Services Inc. (“Advantage”), a
    subsidiary of the Company, has license agreements with
    independently owned associate offices (“Associates”).
    The Associates are responsible for selling and marketing
    Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational
    functions. Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized
    back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration
    services for the Associates, including the billing and
    collection of processing fees and the collection and remittance
    of payroll and payroll tax funds pursuant to Advantage’s
    service arrangement with Associate customers. The marketing and
    selling by the Associates is conducted under their respective
    logos. Commissions earned by the Associates are based on the
    processing activity for the related clients. Revenue generated
    from customers as a result of these relationships and
    commissions paid to Associates are included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income as service revenue and selling, general and
    administrative expense, respectively.

PEO workers’ compensation
    insurance:

Workers’ compensation
    insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated
    costs of paying claims underwritten by the Company. These
    reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for
    those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain
    expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In
    establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves,
    the Company uses an independent actuarial estimate of
    undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle
    the claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
    and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
    actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
    multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes
    in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could
    materially impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may
    vary from the present estimates, particularly when those
    payments may not occur until well into the future.

The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated
    workers’ compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to
    previously established reserves are reflected in the results of
    operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified.
    Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
    variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

In fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, workers’ compensation
    insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on
    claims paid as incurred. The Company’s maximum individual
    claims liability was $750,000 under both its fiscal 2007 policy
    and its fiscal 2006 policy.

The Company had recorded the following amounts on its
    Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation
    claims as of:

Stock-based compensation
    costs:

Effective June 1, 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004)
    (“SFAS No. 123 (R)”), “Share-Based
    Payment,” which replaces SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and
    supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
    (“APB 25”), “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees.” This statement requires that all stock-based
    awards to employees, including grants of stock options, be
    recognized as compensation costs in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of
    grant. These costs are recognized as expense in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income over the requisite service period and
    increase additional paid-in capital. The Company adopted this
    standard using the modified-prospective transition method, and
    accordingly, results for the prior periods have not been
    restated.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires
    various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of
    the Paychex stock price and expected option life. Volatility is
    estimated based on a combination of historical volatility using
    weekly stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a
    period equal to the expected option life. Expected option life
    is estimated based on historical exercise behavior.

Under SFAS No. 123 (R), the Company is required to
    estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for
    those awards that are expected to vest. The assumptions for
    forfeitures were determined based on type of award and
    historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at
    the point in time a significant change is identified with any

catch-up

adjustment recorded in the period of change, with the final
    adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal
    actual forfeitures.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in the Company’s results of operations.

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its
    application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of
    stock option grants. The Company periodically reassesses its
    assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will
    reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes
    available in the future indicating that another model would
    provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if
    characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.

Refer to Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion of the Company’s
    stock-based compensation plans.

Income taxes:

The Company accounts for
    deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and
    liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
    that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
    or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
    financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities
    using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. With the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123 (R) in fiscal 2007, the Company records a
    deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs
    recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of the
    exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of restricted
    stock awards, the Company accounts for the resulting tax
    deduction by reducing its accrued income tax liability with an
    offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit
    increasing additional paid-in capital. The Company currently has
    a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in
    capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to
    stock-based awards.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles requires management to make
    estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual amounts and results could differ from
    these estimates.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

New accounting pronouncements:

In June
    2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109,” to create a single model to address
    accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48
    clarifies the accounting for income tax by prescribing a minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before
    being recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
    FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
    in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2006. The Company will adopt FIN 48 as of June 1,
    2007, as required. While Paychex continues to evaluate the
    impact of this interpretation and its guidance on application,
    the Company currently estimates the adoption of FIN 48 will
    increase the reserve for unrecognized tax positions by
    approximately $8.0 million, primarily related to state
    income tax matters. This increase will be recorded as a decrease
    to opening retained earnings as of June 1, 2007. The
    adoption of FIN 48 is also expected to impact the
    Company’s effective income tax rate for the fiscal year
    ending May 31, 2008, increasing it by approximately
    50 basis points.

In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. 48-1,

“Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48.” This FSP amends FIN 48 to provide
    guidance that a Company may recognize a previously unrecognized
    tax benefit if the tax position is effectively (as opposed to
    “ultimately”) settled through examination,
    negotiation, or litigation. The Company will apply the guidance
    in this FSP upon adoption of FIN 48 in June 2007.

In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP FIN 46(R)-6,
    “Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying
    FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).” This FSP provides
    additional guidance on the determination of and accounting for
    variable interests under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).
    This FSP was effective for reporting periods beginning after
    June 15, 2006, and the Company implemented its guidance
    beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 relative to its
    limited partner investments in low-income housing projects. The
    adoption of this FSP did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s results of operations or financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” This statement clarifies
    the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company has
    not yet determined the effect, if any, the adoption of this
    statement will have on its results of operations or financial
    position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Post-Retirement Plans.” This statement requires an
    employer to recognize the over-funded or under-funded status of
    a defined benefit post-retirement plan and to recognize changes
    in the funded status in the year of change through comprehensive
    income. The statement is effective as of the end of the fiscal
    year ending after December 15, 2006. The Company currently
    does not have any benefit plans subject to this new statement
    and, therefore, expects no impact on its results of operations
    or financial position.

In October 2006, the FASB issued FSPs related to
    SFAS No. 123 (R) as follows:

•

FAS 123 (R)-5, “Amendment of FASB Staff Position 123
    (R)-1;” and

•

FAS 123 (R)-6, “Technical Corrections of FASB
    Statement No. 123 (R).”

Both FSPs are effective in the first reporting period beginning
    after the date the FSP is posted to the FASB website, which for
    Paychex was the three months ended February 28, 2007. The
    adoption of these FSPs did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s results of operations or financial position.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment to FASB Statement
    No. 115.” This statement allows a company to
    irrevocably elect fair value as a measurement attribute for
    certain financial assets and financial liabilities with changes
    in fair value recognized in the results of operations. The
    statement also establishes presentation and disclosure
    requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between
    companies that choose different measurement attributes for
    similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after

Note B —

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

The Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and
    restated (the “2002 Plan”), became effective on
    October 12, 2005 upon its approval by the Company’s
    stockholders. The 2002 Plan authorizes the granting of options
    to purchase up to 29.1 million shares of the Company’s
    common stock. As of May 31, 2007, there were
    15.7 million shares available for future grants under the
    2002 Plan.

No future grants will be made pursuant to the Paychex, Inc. 1998
    or 1995 Stock Incentive Plans, which expired in August 2002 and
    1998, respectively. However, options to purchase an aggregate of
    3.2 million shares under these two plans remain outstanding
    as of May 31, 2007.

As discussed in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, effective June 1, 2006 (the
    “adoption date”), the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (R). This statement requires that all
    stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock
    options, be recognized as compensation costs in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of
    the date of grant. These costs are recognized as an expense in
    the Consolidated Statements of Income over the requisite service
    period and increase additional paid-in capital.

The Company adopted this standard using the modified-prospective
    transition method, and accordingly, results for prior periods
    have not been restated. Under this transition method, the
    Company recognized for fiscal 2007 compensation costs for:
    (1) stock-based awards granted after the adoption date
    based on grant date fair value in accordance with the provisions
    of SFAS No. 123 (R); and (2) the unvested portion
    of any grants issued prior to the adoption date based on the
    grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
    provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Prior to the adoption date, the Company accounted for
    stock-based compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value
    method described in APB 25 and related interpretations, as
    permitted by SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, no
    compensation costs were recognized for stock option grants
    because the exercise price of the stock options granted was
    equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
    the grant.

Prior to the adoption date, the Company presented all tax
    benefits from the exercise of stock options as cash flows from
    operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. SFAS No. 123 (R) requires tax benefits in
    excess of compensation costs recognized in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements (“excess tax benefits”) to be
    presented as cash flows from financing activities. In accordance
    with SFAS No. 123 (R), excess tax benefits recognized
    in periods after the adoption date have been properly classified
    as cash flows from financing activities. Total tax benefits
    recognized in periods prior to the adoption date remain
    classified as cash flows from operating activities.

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123 (R), the Company
    recognized $25.7 million in stock-based compensation costs
    and $7.6 million in income tax benefits in its Consolidated
    Statements of Income for fiscal 2007. Capitalized stock-based
    compensation costs related to the development of internal use
    software for fiscal 2007 were not significant.

Stock-based compensation costs for any awards granted subsequent
    to the adoption date are recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the requisite service period to better align the costs with
    the employee services provided. Compensation costs for
    stock-based awards granted prior to the adoption date will
    continue to be recognized according to an accelerated
    amortization schedule related to the graded vesting terms of the
    grant, as they were for the pro-forma disclosures above.

As of May 31, 2007, the total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to all unvested stock-based awards was
    $60.7 million and is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 2.7 years.

Stock option grants:

Stock option
    grants entitle the holder to purchase, at the end of the vesting
    term, a specified number of shares of Paychex common stock at an
    exercise price per share set equal to the closing market price
    of the common stock on the date of grant. All stock option
    grants have a contractual life of ten years from the date of the
    grant and a vesting schedule as established by the Board of
    Directors (the “Board”). The Company issues new shares
    of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises. Non-qualified
    stock option grants since July 2005 vest 20% per annum, with
    previously granted stock options vesting at 33.3% after two
    years of service from the date of the grant, with annual vesting
    at 33.3% thereafter.

The fair value of stock option grants was estimated at the date

    prior to and subsequent to the adoption date. The
    weighted-average assumptions used for valuation under the
    Black-Scholes model for fiscal 2007 (under
    SFAS No. 123 (R)) and for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005
    (pro-forma impact under SFAS No. 123) are as

Risk-free interest rates are yields for zero coupon
    U.S. Treasury notes maturing approximately at the end of
    the expected option life. The estimated volatility factor is
    based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly
    stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a period
    equal to the expected option life. Prior to the adoption date,
    the Company had used historical volatility based on monthly
    stock prices. The expected option life is based on historical
    exercise behavior.

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its
    application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of its
    stock option grants. The Company periodically assesses its
    assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will
    reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes
    available in the future indicating that another model would
    provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if
    characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.

Restricted stock awards:

In July 2006,
    the Board approved a grant of restricted stock awards to the
    Company’s officers and outside directors in accordance with
    the 2002 Plan. All shares underlying awards of restricted stock
    are restricted in that they are not transferable until they
    vest. The recipients of the restricted stock have voting rights
    and earn dividends, which are paid to the recipient at the time
    of vesting of the awards. If the recipient leaves Paychex prior
    to the vesting date for any reason, the shares of restricted
    stock and the dividends accrued on those shares will be
    forfeited and returned to Paychex.

For restricted stock awards granted to officers, the shares vest
    upon the fifth anniversary of the grant date provided the
    recipient is still an employee of the Company on that date.
    These awards have a provision for the acceleration of vesting
    based on achievement of performance targets established by the
    Board. If the established targets are met for a fiscal year,
    one-third of the award will vest. For outside directors, the
    shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. The fair
    value of restricted stock awards is equal to the closing market
    price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant and
    is expensed over the requisite service period on a straight-line
    basis.

The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these
    investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to
    meet the terms of the bonds. In addition, the Company is exposed
    to interest rate risk, as rate volatility will cause
    fluctuations in the market value of held investments and in the
    earnings potential of future investments. The Company attempts
    to mitigate these risks by investing primarily in high credit
    quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and short-term
    securities with an

A-1

rating,
    limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer, and
    by investing in short-to intermediate-term instruments whose
    market value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. The
    Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to
    manage interest rate risk.

The Company’s available-for-sale securities reflected a net
    unrealized loss position of $14.9 million as of
    May 31, 2007 compared with $22.0 million as of
    May 31, 2006. The gross unrealized losses as of
    May 31, 2007 were comprised of 447 available-for-sale
    securities, which had a total market value of $1.6 billion.
    The gross unrealized losses as of May 31, 2006 were
    comprised of 441 available-for-sale securities with a total
    market value of $1.6 billion. The securities in an
    unrealized loss position were in a loss position as follows as

The Company periodically reviews its investment portfolio to
    determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired
    due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation
    concerns. The Company believes that the investments it held as
    of May 31, 2007 were not other-than-temporarily impaired.
    While certain available-for-sale securities had market values
    that were below cost, the Company believes that it was probable
    that the principal and interest would be collected in accordance
    with contractual terms, and that the decline in the market value
    was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to
    increased credit risk. As of May 31, 2007 and May 31,
    2006, substantially all of the securities in an unrealized loss
    position held an AA rating or better. The Company currently
    believes that it has the ability and intent to hold these
    investments until the earlier of market price recovery or
    maturity. The Company’s assessment that an investment is
    not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future
    due to new developments or changes in the Company’s
    strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

401(k) Plans:

The Company maintains a
    contributory savings plan that qualifies under
    section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Paychex,
    Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan (the “Plan”)
    allows all employees to immediately participate in the salary
    deferral portion of the Plan, contributing up to a maximum of
    50% of their salary. Employees who have completed one year of
    service are eligible to receive a company matching contribution.
    The Company currently matches 50% of an employee’s
    voluntary contribution up to 6% of a participant’s gross
    wages.

This Plan is 100% participant-directed. Plan participants can
    fully diversify their portfolios by choosing from any or all
    investment fund choices in the Plan. Transfers in and out of
    investment funds, including the Paychex, Inc. Employee Stock
    Ownership Plan (ESOP) Stock Fund, are not restricted in any
    manner. The Company match contribution follows the same fund
    elections as the employee compensation deferrals.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company contributions to the Plan for fiscal 2007, 2006, and
    2005 were $10.2 million, $9.1 million, and
    $7.9 million, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans:

The
    Company offers a non-qualified and unfunded Deferred
    Compensation Plan to a select group of key employees, executive
    officers, and outside directors. Eligible employees are provided
    with the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual base
    salary and bonus and outside directors to defer 100% of their
    Board cash compensation. Gains and losses are credited based on
    the participant’s election of a variety of investment
    choices. The Company does not match any participant deferral or
    guarantee its return. The amounts accrued under this plan were
    $9.3 million and $6.6 million as of May 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively, and are reflected in other long-term
    liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Prior to the April 1, 2003 acquisition, InterPay, Inc.
    (“InterPay”) entered into various salary continuation
    agreements with certain former employees. These agreements
    provide for benefits to these retired employees, and in certain
    cases to their beneficiaries, for life or other designated
    periods through 2015. The amounts accrued under these agreements
    were $1.3 million and $1.6 million as of May 31,
    2007 and May 31, 2006, respectively, and represent the
    estimated present value of the benefits earned under these
    agreements.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

The
    Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which
    eligible employees may purchase common stock of the Company at
    current market prices with no look-back provision. All
    transactions occur directly through the Company’s transfer
    agent and no brokerage fees are charged to employees, except for
    when stock is sold.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Lines of credit:

The Company has unused
    borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted, secured,
    short-term lines of credit at market rates of interest with
    financial institutions as follows:

Wells Fargo Bank, National

February 2008

The credit facilities are evidenced by Promissory Notes and are
    secured by separate Pledge Security Agreements by and between
    Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the
    “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Company has granted
    each of the Lenders a security interest in certain investment
    securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
    custody account pursuant to the terms of a Control Agreement and
    is to be administered under an Intercreditor Agreement among the
    Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may
    require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account
    into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual
    Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
    short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
    overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from
    electronic payment transactions on behalf of clients in the
    ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were
    outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2007 or
    as of May 31, 2007.

Letters of credit:

The Company had
    irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling
    $62.4 million and $53.4 million as of May 31,
    2007 and May 31, 2006, respectively, required to secure
    commitments for certain insurance policies. These letters of
    credit as of May 31, 2007 expire at various dates between
    December 2007 and July 2008. The letters are secured by
    securities held in the Company’s corporate investment
    portfolio, including a $53.5 million letter of credit for
    which funds have been segregated into a separate account. No
    amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during
    fiscal 2007 or as of May 31, 2007.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Contingencies:

The Company is subject
    to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal
    course of its business. These include disputes or potential
    disputes related to breach of contract, employment-related
    claims, tax claims, and other matters.

In August 2001, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,
    Rapid Payroll, Inc. (“Rapid Payroll”) informed
    76 licensees that it intended to stop supporting their
    payroll processing software in August of 2002. Thereafter,
    lawsuits were commenced by licensees asserting various claims,
    including breach of contract and related tort and fraud causes
    of action. As previously reported in the prior periodic reports,
    these lawsuits sought compensatory damages, punitive damages,
    and injunctive relief against Rapid Payroll, the Company, the
    Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, and its Senior
    Vice President of Sales and Marketing. In accordance with the
    Company’s indemnification agreements with its senior
    executives, the Company has agreed to defend and, if necessary,
    indemnify them in connection with these pending matters.

At the present time, the Company has fully resolved its
    licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with 74 of
    the 76 licensees who were provided services by Rapid Payroll. A
    decision favorable to Paychex, Inc. was issued by the United
    States District Court for the Central District of California
    with respect to the Company’s dispute with one of the
    remaining two licensees. That licensee is currently appealing
    the case. A verdict was issued on June 27, 2007 in
    litigation brought by the other remaining licensee. In that
    case, the California Superior Court, Los Angeles County jury
    awarded to the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory
    damages and subsequently awarded an additional
    $11.0 million in punitive damages. The Company will seek to
    have the verdict reduced or reversed through post-trial motions
    and, if necessary, an appeal.

The Company has recorded a reserve for pending litigation
    matters. The litigation reserve has been adjusted in fiscal 2007
    to account for settlements, increases in reserves, and incurred
    litigation expenditures. During fiscal 2007, the Company
    increased its litigation reserve by $38.0 million to
    account for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to
    pending litigation matters. The Company’s reserve for all
    pending litigation totaled $32.5 million as of May 31,
    2007, and is included in current liabilities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

In light of the reserve for all pending litigation matters, the
    Company’s management currently believes that resolution of
    outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent
    uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate

The Company guarantees performance of service on annual
    maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service
    contracts through a third party. In the normal course of
    business, the Company makes representations and warranties that
    guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements
    with clients. In addition, the Company has entered into
    indemnification agreements with its officers and directors,
    which require the Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify
    these individuals for matters related to their services provided
    to the Company. Historically, there have been no material losses
    related to such guarantees and indemnifications.

Paychex currently self-insures the deductible portion of various
    insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. The
    Company’s estimated loss exposure under these insurance
    arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued
    have not been material. The Company also maintains insurance
    coverage in addition to its purchased primary insurance policies
    for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and
    omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism; and
    capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through its
    captive insurance company.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting:

Disclosure controls
    and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that
    information required to be disclosed in the Company’s
    reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”), such as this report, is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures are also designed with the objective of ensuring that
    such information is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
    to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures:

As of the end of the period
    covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and
    procedures as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this
    report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective at meeting their objectives.

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
    Reporting:

There were no changes in the
    Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that
    occurred during the Company’s most recently completed
    fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

The Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm on Effectiveness of Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting are incorporated herein by
    reference from Part II, Item 8 of this
