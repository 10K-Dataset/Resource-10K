PART I

“SAFE
    HARBOR” STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION
    REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain written and oral statements made by management of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“we,”
    “our,” “us,” or the “Company”) may
    constitute “forward-looking statements” as defined in
    the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the
    “Reform Act”). Forward-looking statements are
    identified by such words and phrases as “we expect,”
    “expected to,” “estimates,”
    “estimated,” “current outlook,” “we
    look forward to,” “would equate to,”
    “projects,” “projections,” “projected
    to be,” “anticipates,” “anticipated,”
    “we believe,” “could be,” and other similar
    phrases. All statements addressing operating performance,
    events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur
    in the future, including statements relating to revenue growth,
    earnings, earnings- per-share growth, or similar projections,
    are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform
    Act. Because they are forward-looking, they should be evaluated
    in light of important risk factors. These risk factors include,
    but are not limited to, the following risks as well as those
    described in “Risk Factors” under Item 1A and
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

•

general market and economic conditions including, among others,
    changes in United States (“U.S.”) employment and wage
    levels, changes in new hiring trends, changes in short- and
    long-term interest rates, and changes in the fair value and the
    credit rating of securities held by us;

•

changes in demand for our services and products, ability to
    develop and market new services and products effectively,
    pricing changes and the impact of competition, and the
    availability of skilled workers;

•

changes in the laws regulating collection and payment of payroll
    taxes, professional employer organizations, and employee
    benefits, including retirement plans, workers’
    compensation, health insurance, state unemployment, and
    section 125 plans;

•

changes in workers’ compensation rates and underlying
    claims trends;

•

the possibility of failure to keep pace with technological
    changes and provide timely enhancements to services and products;

•

the possibility of failure of our operating facilities, computer
    systems, and communication systems during a catastrophic event;

•

the possibility of third-party service providers failing to
    perform their functions;

•

the possibility of penalties and losses resulting from errors
    and omissions in performing services;

•

the possible inability of our clients to meet their payroll
    obligations;

•

the possible failure of internal controls or our inability to
    implement business processing improvements; and

•

potentially unfavorable outcomes related to pending legal
    matters.

Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from our anticipated results. The information
    provided in this

Form 10-K

is based upon the facts and circumstances known at this time. We
    undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking
    statements after the date of filing of this

Form 10-K

with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
    “Commission”) to reflect events or circumstances after
    such date, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Item 1.

Business

We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and
    integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing
    solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses in the
    U.S. As of May 31, 2008, we serviced approximately
    572,000 clients and had approximately 12,200 employees. We
    maintain our corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and
    have more than 100 offices nationwide.

As of May 31, 2008, we also serviced approximately 1,200
    clients in Germany through four offices.



Our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in 1979. We
    report our results of operations and financial condition as one
    business segment. Our fiscal year ends May 31.

Company
    Strategy

We are focused on achieving strong, long-term financial
    performance by:

•

providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable
    comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource services;

•

delivering these services utilizing a well-trained and
    responsive work force through a network of local and corporate
    offices servicing more than 100 of the largest markets in the
    U.S.;

•

growing our client base, primarily through the efforts of our
    direct sales force;

•

continually improving client service and maximizing client
    retention;

•

capitalizing on the growth opportunities within our current
    client base and from new clients by increasing utilization of
    our payroll and human resource ancillary services and products;

•

capitalizing on and leveraging our highly developed
    technological and operating infrastructure; and

•

supplementing our growth through strategic acquisition or
    expansion of service offerings when appropriate opportunities
    arise.

Market
    Opportunities

The outsourcing of business processes continues to be a trend
    within the U.S. Outsourcing of the payroll and human
    resource functions allows small- to medium-sized businesses to
    minimize the administrative burden and compliance risks
    associated with increasingly complex and changing administrative
    requirements and federal, state, and local tax regulations. By
    utilizing the expertise of outsourcing service providers,
    businesses are better able to efficiently meet their compliance
    requirements and administrative burdens while, at the same time,
    providing competitive benefits for their employees. The
    technical capabilities, knowledge, and operational expertise
    that we have built, along with the broad portfolio of ancillary
    services and products we offer our clients, have enabled us to
    capitalize on the outsourcing popularity.

We believe there are approximately 9.4 million employers in
    the geographic markets that we currently serve within the
    U.S. Of those employers, over 99% have fewer than
    100 employees and are our primary customers and target
    market. Based on publicly available industry data, we estimate
    that all payroll processors combined serve approximately 15% of
    the potential businesses in the target market, with much of the
    unpenetrated market being composed of businesses with ten or
    fewer employees. We remain focused on servicing small- to
    medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we
    believe exists in this market segment.

Clients

We serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients
    operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the
    U.S. As of May 31, 2008, we serviced approximately
    572,000 clients. We utilize service agreements and arrangements
    with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any
    time or upon relatively short notice. For the year ended
    May 31, 2008 (“fiscal 2008”), client retention
    was approximately 80% of our beginning of the year client base.
    The most significant factors impacting client retention are
    companies going out of business or no longer having any
    employees. No single client has a material impact on total
    service revenue or results of operations.

    the U.S.) by number of employees is as follows:

Services
    and Products

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services and products that
    allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human
    resource needs. These include:

•

payroll processing;

•

payroll tax administration services;

•

employee payment services;

•

regulatory compliance services (new-hire reporting and
    garnishment processing);

•

comprehensive human resource outsourcing services;

•

retirement services administration;

•

workers’ compensation insurance services;

•

health and benefits services;

•

time and attendance solutions; and

•

other human resource services and products.

By offering ancillary services that leverage the information
    gathered in the base payroll processing service, we are able to
    provide comprehensive outsourcing services that allow employers
    to expand their employee benefits offerings at an affordable
    cost. We mainly earn our revenue through recurring fees for
    services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the
    number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay
    period, and utilization of ancillary services.

Payroll
    Processing

Payroll processing is the foundation of our service portfolio.
    Our payroll service includes the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; preparation of
    federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
    and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations. Payroll
    processing clients are charged a base fee each period that
    payroll is processed, plus a fee per employee check processed.
    Our payroll services are provided through either our core
    payroll or Major Market Services (“MMS”) and are made
    available to clients via traditional or Internet-based methods.

Paychex Online is our secure Internet site, which offers core
    payroll clients a suite of self-service, interactive services
    and products twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. These
    include Paychex Online
    Payroll

sm

,
    Internet Time Sheet, Paychex Online Reports, and General Ledger
    Reporting Service. Clients can communicate payroll information
    through the Internet Time Sheet or use the Online Payroll
    service, and can access current and historical payroll
    information using Paychex Online Reports. The General Ledger
    Reporting Service transfers payroll information calculated by us
    to the clients’ general ledger accounting software,
    eliminating manual entries and improving the accuracy of
    bookkeeping. Approximately 297,000 clients are currently
    utilizing some form of Paychex Online service.



Major Market Services:

MMS primarily
    targets companies that have more complex payroll and benefits
    needs or have outgrown our core payroll service. We currently
    offer this service in all of our significant markets.
    Approximately one-third of new MMS clients are conversions from
    our core payroll service.

We offer a software-as-a-service solution to meet the payroll
    and human resource administrative needs of our MMS clients. Our
    proprietary MMS software,
    Preview

®

,
    provides a powerful payroll solution and allows smooth
    integration with other Paychex service offerings. Preview can be
    used as an

on-site,

PC-based system or via a secure web-hosted environment.

Preview can be integrated with various Internet-based services
    offered to assist clients with their administrative human
    resource and payroll needs, in every step of the employee life
    cycle. Ancillary services particularly offered to our MMS
    clients include Paychex HR Online, BeneTrac, Paychex Time and
    Labor Online, and applicant tracking. Paychex HR Online, our
    Internet-based human resource management system, offers powerful
    tools for managing employee benefits, personnel information, and
    critical human resource compliance and reporting needs. In
    addition, its self-service features allow for better
    communication between management and employees. BeneTrac, our
    employee benefits management and administration system, provides
    our MMS clients a simple, accurate, and cost-effective solution
    for streamlined benefits management. Paychex Time and Labor
    Online makes the time and attendance process more efficient.
    This solution can reduce time spent on preparing timesheets,
    minimize redundant data entry, increase awareness of critical
    labor information, and aid in compliance with federal time
    recording requirements. We have also partnered with Taleo
    Corporation for applicant tracking providing our MMS clients
    with a tool to manage their recruiting process, in order to
    better hire and retain talented employees.

In addition, MMS clients can select from a number of á la
    carte payroll and human resource ancillary services or opt for
    our comprehensive human resource and payroll outsourcing
    solution, Paychex
    Premier

®

Human Resources (“Paychex Premier”). This flexibility
    allows our clients to define the solution that best meets their
    particular needs.

Ancillary
    Services and Products

We provide our clients with a portfolio of ancillary services
    and products that have been developed and refined over many
    years. Ancillary services and products provide us with
    additional recurring revenue streams and increased service
    efficiencies as these services and products are integrated with
    our payroll processing services. We offer the following
    ancillary services and products:

Payroll tax administration services:

As
    of May 31, 2008, 93% of our clients utilized our payroll
    tax administration services (including
    Taxpay

®

),
    which provide accurate preparation and timely filing of
    quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic
    transfer of funds to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies
    (federal, state, and local). Nearly all of our new clients
    purchase our payroll tax administration services. In connection
    with these services, we electronically collect payroll taxes
    from clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare
    and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due
    dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and
    30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with
    some items extending to 90 days. We handle all regulatory
    correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes,
    and we are subject to cash penalties imposed by tax or
    regulatory agencies for late filings and late or under payment
    of taxes. Clients utilizing the payroll tax administration
    services are charged a base fee and a fee per transaction for
    each period that payroll is processed. In addition to fees paid
    by clients, we earn interest on client funds that are collected
    before due dates and invested until remittance to the applicable
    tax or regulatory agencies.

Employee payment services:

As of
    May 31, 2008, 73% of our clients utilized our employee
    payment services, which provide the employer the option of
    paying their employees by direct deposit, Chase Pay Card

Plus

, a check drawn on a Paychex, Inc. account
    (Readychex

®

),
    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by us. More than 80% of new clients select
    some form of employee payment services. For the first three
    methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the
    clients’ bank account, typically one day before payday, and
    provide payment to the employee on payday. Our flexible payment
    options provide a cost-effective solution that offers the
    benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation
    for employers. Clients utilizing employee payment services are
    charged a base fee for each period that payroll is processed and
    a



fee per transaction or per employee depending on the service
    provided. In addition to fees paid by clients, we earn interest
    on client funds that are collected before pay dates and invested
    until remittance to clients’ employees.

Regulatory compliance services:

We
    offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to
    comply with federal and state requirements to report information
    on newly hired employees, to aid the government in enforcing
    child support orders, and to minimize fraudulent unemployment
    and workers’ compensation insurance claims. Our garnishment
    processing service provides deductions from employees’ pay,
    forwards payments to third-party agencies, including those that
    require electronic payments, and tracks the obligations to
    fulfillment. These services enable employers to comply with
    legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties.

Comprehensive human resource outsourcing
    services:

Paychex Premier provides businesses
    a full-service approach to the outsourcing of employer and
    employee administrative needs. Paychex Premier offers businesses
    a combined package of services that includes payroll, employer
    compliance, human resource and employee benefits administration,
    risk management outsourcing, and the

on-site

availability of a professionally trained human resource
    representative. This comprehensive bundle of services is
    designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
    payroll and related benefit costs while providing a benefits
    package equal to that of larger companies. Our Professional
    Employer Organization (“PEO”) provides businesses with
    primarily the same services as Paychex Premier, except we serve
    as a co-employer of the clients’ employees, assume the
    risks and rewards of workers’ compensation insurance, and
    provide more sophisticated health care offerings to PEO clients.
    Our PEO service is available primarily for clients domiciled in
    select U.S. states where the utilization of PEOs is more
    prevalent. We offer our PEO service through our subsidiary,
    Paychex Business Solutions, Inc. For the two comprehensive human
    resource outsourcing services, the client pays a fee per
    employee per processing period. As of May 31, 2008, our
    comprehensive human resource outsourcing serviced approximately
    439,000 client employees.

Retirement services administration:

Our
    retirement services product line offers a variety of options to
    clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE, SIMPLE IRA,
    401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, profit sharing, and
    money purchase plans. These services provide plan
    implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations,
    employee and employer reporting, participant and employer access
    online, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative
    services. Clients have the ability to choose from a group of
    pre-defined fund selections or to customize their investment
    options within their plan. Selling efforts for these services
    are focused primarily on our existing payroll client base, as
    the processed payroll information allows for data integration
    necessary to provide these services efficiently. We are one of
    the largest 401(k) recordkeepers for small businesses in the
    U.S. Clients utilizing this service are charged a one-time
    set up fee, a monthly recurring fee, and a fee per employee. We
    earn a fee approximating thirty-five basis points from the
    external managers based on the total asset value of client
    employee 401(k) funds. The asset value of client employee 401(k)
    funds externally managed totaled approximately $9.7 billion
    as of May 31, 2008. Retirement services were utilized by
    approximately 48,000 clients as of May 31, 2008.

Workers’ compensation insurance
    services:

Most employers are required to
    carry workers’ compensation insurance, which provides
    payments to employees who are unable to work because of
    job-related injuries. We provide workers’ compensation
    insurance services through our licensed insurance agency, acting
    as general agent to provide insurance through a variety of
    insurance carriers who are underwriters. Our Workers’
    Compensation Payment Service uses rate and job classification
    information to enable clients to pay workers’ compensation
    premiums in regular monthly amounts rather than with large
    up-front payments, which stabilizes their cash flow and
    minimizes year-end adjustments. Our Workers’ Compensation
    Report Service provides our clients with comprehensive
    information to allow them to better manage workers’
    compensation insurance costs. As of May 31, 2008,
    approximately 72,000 clients utilized our workers’
    compensation insurance services.

Health and benefits services:

We offer
    health and benefits services through our licensed insurance
    agency, acting as general agent to provide insurance through a
    variety of carriers who are underwriters. Our services include
    shopping for the best plans, providing comparisons of national
    and regional insurers to match features and affordability to the
    client’s needs, informing and enrolling employees, tracking
    additions and terminations, calculating and initiating payroll
    deductions, communicating with the insurance carriers, and
    assisting with renewal of policies. These services simplify the
    insurance process while allowing access to group rates, which
    allow our clients to offer valuable benefits to their employees
    at an affordable cost.



Time and attendance solutions:

We offer
    Time In A
    Box

®

and other time and attendance solutions, which help employers
    minimize the time spent compiling time sheet information. These
    computer-based systems allow the employer flexibility to handle
    multiple payroll scenarios and result in improved productivity,
    accuracy, and reliability in the payroll process. Certain
    clients are charged a monthly fee for use of hardware, software,
    and support. Clients also have the option to purchase the
    hardware and software with annual maintenance contracts. Time In
    A Box is marketed to our small- to medium-sized clients, while
    other time and attendance solutions are marketed to larger
    clients.

Other human resource services and
    products:

We offer the outsourcing of plan
    administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for
    certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care
    expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation,
    administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement,
    and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer
    state unemployment insurance services, which provide clients
    with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations,
    change statements, and requests for separation documents. Other
    Human Resource Services products include employee handbooks,
    management manuals, and personnel and required regulatory forms.
    These products are designed to simplify clients’ office
    processes and enhance their employee benefits programs.

Sales and
    Marketing

We market our services primarily through our direct sales force
    based in the metropolitan markets we serve. Our sales
    representatives specialize in Payroll or Human Resource
    Services. For the year ending May 31, 2009, our sales force
    is expected to total approximately 2,325 and is comprised of the
    following categories of sales representatives:

Retirement services administration and other human resource
    services

Total sales representatives

2,325

In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we
    utilize relationships with existing clients, certified public
    accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client
    referrals. Approximately two-thirds of our new clients
    (excluding acquisitions) come from these referral sources. To
    further enhance our strong relationship with CPAs, we have
    partnered with the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll
    provider for its AICPA Business Solutions Partner Program. As of
    May 31, 2008, more than 20,000 CPA firms nationwide
    participated in this program, which includes our payroll
    services and retirement services administration.

Our website at

www.paychex.com

, which includes online
    payroll sales presentations and service and product information,
    is a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of leads and
    new sales while complementing the efforts of our direct sales
    force. This online tool allows us to market to clients in more
    geographically remote areas. Our sales representatives are also
    supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade
    shows, and telemarketing programs. We have grown and expect to
    continue to grow our direct sales force. In recent years, we
    have increased our emphasis on the selling of ancillary services
    and products to both new clients and our existing client base.

In addition, Advantage Payroll Services Inc.
    (“Advantage”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex,
    Inc., has license agreements with independently owned associate
    offices (“Associates”), which are responsible for
    selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing
    certain operational functions, while Paychex, Inc. and Advantage
    provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and
    payroll tax administration services. The marketing and selling
    by the Associates is conducted under their own logos.



Competition

The market for payroll processing and human resource services is
    highly competitive and fragmented. We believe our primary
    national competitor,
    ADP

®

(“Automatic Data Processing, Inc.”), is the largest
    U.S. third-party provider of payroll processing and human
    resource services in terms of revenue. We compete with other
    national, regional, local, and online service providers, all of
    which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us.

In addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource
    service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and human
    resource systems and departments. Payroll and human resource
    systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our Human
    Resource Services products also compete with a variety of
    providers of human resource services, such as retirement
    services companies, insurance companies, and human resources and
    benefits consulting firms.

Competition in the payroll processing and human resource
    services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness,
    product quality and reputation, breadth of service and product
    offering, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of
    these areas.

Software
    Maintenance and Development

The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and
    regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the
    proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human
    resource services to our clients. We are continually engaged in
    developing enhancements to and maintenance of our various
    software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our
    clients and the marketplace.

Employees

As of May 31, 2008, we employed approximately
    12,200 people. None of our employees were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements.

Intellectual
    Property

We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names,
    copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and
    software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a
    whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the
    conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be
    appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual
    property rights, including, but not limited to,
    confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with
    employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with
    licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and
    registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the
    “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material
    importance to us.

Seasonality

There is no significant seasonality to our business. However,
    during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the
    number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients,
    and new Paychex Premier and PEO worksite employees tends to be
    higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily
    because a majority of new clients begin using our services in
    the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end
    transaction processing and client funds activity are
    traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to
    clients paying year-end bonuses and requesting additional
    year-end services. Historically, as a result of these factors,
    our total revenue has been slightly higher in the third fiscal
    quarter, with greater sales commission expenses also reported in
    this quarter.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our future results of operations are subject to a number of
    risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could
    cause actual results to differ materially from historical and
    current results and from our projections. Important factors
    known to us that could cause such differences include, but are
    not limited to, those discussed below and those contained in the
    “Safe Harbor” statement at the beginning of
    Part I of this

Form 10-K.

We may make errors and omissions in providing services,
    which could result in significant penalties and liabilities for
    us:

Processing, tracking, collecting, and
    remitting client funds to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies, client employees, and other third parties are complex
    operations. These tasks could be subject to error and these
    errors could include, but are not limited to, late filing with
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies, underpayment of taxes,
    and failure to comply with applicable banking regulations and
    laws relating to employee benefits administration, which could
    result in significant penalties and liabilities that would
    adversely affect our results of operations. We could also
    transfer funds in error to an incorrect party or for the wrong
    amount, and may be unable to correct the error or recover the
    funds, resulting in a loss to us.

Our business and reputation may be affected by our ability
    to keep clients’ information confidential:

Our business involves the use of significant
    amounts of private and confidential client information including
    employees’ identification numbers, bank accounts, and
    retirement account information. This information is critical to
    the accurate and timely provision of services to our clients,
    and certain information may be transmitted via the Internet.
    There is no guarantee that our systems and processes are
    adequate to protect against all security breaches. If our
    systems are disrupted or fail for any reason, or if our systems
    are infiltrated by unauthorized persons, our clients could
    experience data loss, financial loss, harm to reputation, or
    significant business interruption. Such events may expose us to
    unexpected liability, litigation, regulation investigation and
    penalties, loss of clients’ business, unfavorable impact to
    business reputation, and there could be a material adverse
    effect on our business and results of operations.

Our services may be adversely impacted by changes in
    government regulations and policies:

Many of
    our services, particularly payroll tax administration services
    and employee benefit plan administration services, are designed
    according to government regulations that continue to change.
    Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of
    benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide
    employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and
    employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or
    eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially
    decrease our revenue. Added requirements could also increase our
    cost of doing business. Failure by us to modify our services in
    a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

We may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party
    service providers to perform their functions:

As part of providing services to clients, we
    rely on a number of third-party service providers. These service
    providers include, but are not limited to, couriers used to
    deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically
    transfer funds from clients to their employees. Failure by these
    service providers, for any reason, to deliver their services in
    a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our
    operations, impact client relations, and result in significant
    penalties or liabilities to us.

In the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan
    may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and
    adversely interrupt operations:

Our
    operations are dependent on our ability to protect our
    infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural
    disaster, unauthorized security breach, power loss,
    telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, or other events
    that could have a significant disruptive effect on our
    operations. We have a business continuity plan in place in the
    event of system failure due to any of these events. If the
    business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery
    scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience
    material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of
    services to our clients.



We may not be able to keep pace with changes in
    technology:

To maintain our growth strategy,
    we must adapt and respond to technological advances and
    technological requirements of our clients. Our future success
    will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase
    the performance of our internal use systems, particularly our
    systems that meet our clients’ requirements. We continue to
    make significant investments related to the development of new
    technology. If our systems become outdated, we may be at a
    disadvantage when competing in our industry. There can be no
    assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will
    be successful. If we do not integrate and update our systems in
    a timely manner, or if our investments in technology fail to
    provide the expected results, there could be a material adverse
    effect to our business and results of operations.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits from
    acquisitions:

From time to time we acquire
    other companies. The effective integration of acquired companies
    may be difficult to achieve. It is also possible that we may not
    realize any or all expected benefits from acquisitions or
    achieve benefits from acquisitions in a timely manner. In
    addition, we may incur significant costs and management’s
    time and attention may be diverted from other parts of our
    business in connection with the integration of acquisitions.
    Failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could have
    a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may have an adverse outcome of legal matters, which
    could harm our business:

We are subject to
    various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course
    of business. These include disputes or potential disputes
    related to breach of contract, employment-related claims, tax
    claims, and other matters. As of May 31, 2008, we have a
    reserve of $23.0 million for pending litigation. Refer to
    Item 3 of this

Form 10-K

for additional disclosure regarding legal proceedings. In light
    of the litigation reserve recorded, our management currently
    believes that resolution of outstanding legal matters will not
    have a material adverse effect on our financial position or
    results of our operations. However, legal matters are subject to
    inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that
    their ultimate resolution could have a material adverse effect
    on our financial position and results of operations in the
    period in which any such effect is recorded.

We may experience a loss as the result of our clients
    having insufficient funds to cover payments we have made on
    their behalf to applicable tax or regulatory agencies and
    employees:

As part of the payroll processing
    service, we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from
    their bank accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies. It is possible that we
    would be held liable for such amounts in the event the client
    has insufficient funds to cover them. We have made in the past,
    and may make in the future, payments on our clients’ behalf
    for which we are not reimbursed, resulting in a loss to us.

Our interest earned on funds held for clients may be
    impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the
    amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance:

We receive interest income from investing
    client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or
    regulatory agencies or to client employees. A change in
    regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld
    or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or
    regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest income.

We may be exposed to additional risks related to our
    co-employment relationship within our PEO business:

Many federal and state laws that apply to
    the employer-employee relationship do not specifically address
    the obligations and responsibilities of the
    “co-employment” relationship. As a result, there is a
    possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations
    of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or
    omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our
    agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or
    violations. Although our agreements with the clients provide
    that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable
    to its own or its employees’ conduct, we may not be able to
    effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. In
    addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our
    employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the
    “employer” under any of the state or federal laws.

We may be exposed to additional risks related to foreign
    operations as a result of our business in Germany:

As of May 31, 2008, we serviced
    approximately 1,200 clients in Germany. As a result, our
    business is subject to political and economic instability
    unrelated to our operations in the U.S. Additionally, our
    business in Germany exposes us to currency fluctuations, and we
    must operate under legal and tax regulations that differ from
    those of the U.S. We do not currently hedge our foreign
    currency transactions due to the relatively insignificant
    amounts. Our entry into foreign operations requires a
    significant investment and management’s attention. There
    can be no



assurance that our investment in Germany will produce expected
    levels of revenue or that other factors noted previously will
    not harm our business.

Our facilities in Rochester, New York house various
    distribution, processing, and technology functions, certain
    ancillary functions, a telemarketing unit, and other back-office
    functions. Facilities outside of Rochester, New York are at
    various locations throughout the U.S. and Germany and house
    our regional, branch, and sales offices and data processing
    centers. These locations are concentrated in metropolitan areas.
    We believe that adequate, suitable lease space will continue to
    be available for our needs.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in
    the normal course of our business. These include disputes or
    potential disputes related to breach of contract,
    employment-related claims, tax claims, and other matters.

In August 2001, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,
    Rapid Payroll, Inc. (“Rapid Payroll”) informed 76
    licensees that it intended to stop supporting their payroll
    processing software in August of 2002. Thereafter, lawsuits were
    commenced by licensees asserting various claims, including
    breach of contract and related tort and fraud causes of action.
    As previously reported in our prior periodic reports, these
    lawsuits sought compensatory damages, punitive damages, and
    injunctive relief against Rapid Payroll, the Company, its former
    Chief Executive Officer, and its Senior Vice President of Sales
    and Marketing. In accordance with our indemnification agreements
    with our senior executives, the Company has agreed to defend
    and, if necessary, indemnify them in connection with these
    pending matters.

At the present time, the Company has fully resolved its
    licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with 74 of
    the 76 licensees who were provided services by Rapid Payroll. In
    2005, a decision favorable to Paychex, Inc. was issued by the
    United States District Court for the Central District of
    California (the “district court”) with respect to the
    Company’s dispute with one of the remaining two licensees.
    On April 18, 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
    affirmed the district court’s ruling enforcing the
    contractual limitation of liability clause, but reversed for



trial on the issue of tortuous interference with contract. That
    case has been remanded to the district court for further
    proceedings. In 2007, a verdict was issued in the only other
    remaining licensee case, which was pending in California
    Superior Court, Los Angeles County, in which a jury awarded to
    the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory damages and
    subsequently awarded an additional $11.0 million in
    punitive damages. The Company is pursuing an appeal of that
    verdict.

We have a reserve for pending litigation matters. The litigation
    reserve has been adjusted in fiscal 2008 to account for
    settlements and incurred litigation expenditures. Our reserve
    for all pending litigation totaled $23.0 million as of
    May 31, 2008, and is included in current liabilities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

In light of the reserve for all pending litigation matters, our
    management currently believes that resolution of outstanding
    legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position or results of operations. However, legal
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists
    the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters
    could have a material adverse impact on our financial position
    and results of operations in the period in which any such effect
    is recorded.

Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under
    the symbol “PAYX.” Dividends have historically been

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations reviews the operating results of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“we,”
    “our,” or “us”) for each of the three fiscal
    years ended May 31, 2008 (“fiscal 2008”),
    May 31, 2007 (“fiscal 2007”), and May 31,
    2006 (“fiscal 2006”), and our financial condition as
    of May 31, 2008. This review should be read in conjunction
    with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the
    related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Form 10-K”)

and the “Risk Factors” discussed in Item 1A of
    this

Form 10-K.

Forward-looking statements in this review are qualified by the
    cautionary statement under the heading “Safe Harbor
    Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995” contained at the beginning of Part I of this

Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and
    integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing
    solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our Payroll and
    Human Resource Services offer a portfolio of services and
    products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll
    and human resource needs.

Our Payroll services are provided through either our core
    payroll or Major Market Services (“MMS”), which is
    utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and
    benefits needs, and include:

•

payroll processing;

•

payroll tax administration services;

•

employee payment services; and

•

regulatory compliance services (new-hire reporting and
    garnishment processing).

Our Human Resource Services primarily include:

•

comprehensive human resource outsourcing services, which include
    Paychex
    Premier

®

Human Resources and our Professional Employer Organization
    (“PEO”);



•

retirement services administration;

•

workers’ compensation insurance services;

•

health and benefits services;

•

time and attendance solutions; and

•

other human resource services and products.

We mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services
    performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of
    clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and
    utilization of ancillary services. We also earn interest on
    funds held for clients between the time of collection from our
    clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. Our strategy is focused on
    achieving strong long-term financial performance while providing
    high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services; growing
    our client base; increasing utilization of our ancillary
    services; leveraging our technological and operating
    infrastructure; and expanding our service offerings.

Fiscal 2008 was our eighteenth consecutive year of record total
    revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share. It was also
    a milestone year for us as total revenue exceeded
    $2.0 billion for the first time. Our financial results for
    fiscal 2008 included the following highlights:

•

Diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.56 per share.

•

Net income increased 12% to $576 million.

•

Total revenue increased 10% to $2 billion.

•

Payroll service revenue increased 8% to $1.5 billion and
    Human Resource Services revenue increased 19% to
    $0.5 billion.

•

Operating income increased 18% to $828 million.

•

Cash flow from operations increased 15% to $725 million.

•

Dividends of $442 million were paid to stockholders,
    representing 77% of net income.

In July 2007, our Board of Directors (the “Board”)
    approved a 43% increase in our quarterly dividend payment to
    $0.30 per share from $0.21 per share. In August 2007, we
    commenced our program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of
    Paychex, Inc. common stock. We completed this program in
    December 2007, repurchasing a total of 23.7 million shares
    for $1.0 billion.

Our financial performance for fiscal 2008 was largely due to
    service revenue growth of 10% over the prior fiscal year. This
    growth in service revenue was attributable to client base
    growth, higher check volume, price increases, and growth in the
    utilization of our ancillary services. The weakening economy and
    declining interest rates negatively impacted our total revenues
    for fiscal 2008. However, continued leveraging of our expenses
    allowed us to achieve solid profit results during this fiscal
    year.

Our financial performance was impacted by decreases in interest
    rates earned on our funds held for clients and corporate
    investment portfolios. The Federal Funds rate declined
    325 basis points in fiscal 2008 to 2.00% as of May 31,
    2008. Our combined interest on funds held for clients and
    investment income, net, decreased 10% for fiscal 2008 as a
    result of these declining rates, as well as lower corporate
    invested balances due to the funding of the stock repurchase
    program. The combined investment portfolio earned an average
    rate of return of 3.7% for fiscal 2008, compared to 4.0% for
    fiscal 2007 and 3.2% for fiscal 2006. The impact of changing
    interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in
    the “Market Risk Factors” section, contained in
    Item 7A of this

Form 10-K.

We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income
    securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage
    interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2008, we had no exposure
    to high-risk or illiquid investments. Refer to the
    “Investment Portfolio Overview” section of this
    Item 7 for more information.

In addition to reporting operating income, a generally accepted
    accounting principle (“GAAP”) measure, we present
    operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP
    measure. We believe operating income, net of



certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an
    indicator of our core business operations performance period
    over period. It is also the measure used internally for
    establishing the following year’s targets and measuring
    management’s performance in connection with certain
    performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating
    income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held
    for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to increase
    the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an
    adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest
    rates, which are not within the control of management. The
    expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an
    adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent
    nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and
    obscures the comparability of performance period over period.
    Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated
    through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of
    disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”). As such, it should not be considered as a
    substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and,
    therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction
    with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may
    produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be
    comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other
    companies. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 15%
    to $696.5 million for fiscal 2008 compared to
    $605.4 million for fiscal 2007 and $548.8 million for
    fiscal 2006.

We continue to make investments in our business as part of our
    growth strategy. Some of these investments include the following:

Growing the client base and increasing utilization of
    ancillary services:

Our client base increased to
    approximately 572,000 clients as of May 31, 2008. This
    compares with approximately 561,000 clients as of May 31,
    2007, and approximately 543,000 clients as of May 31, 2006.
    Client base growth was 2.0% for fiscal 2008, compared with 3.3%
    for fiscal 2007 and 4.0% for fiscal 2006. Net client growth in
    fiscal 2008 reflected weaker economic conditions including,
    among others, a reduced level of new business starts in the
    markets we serve and an approximately 11% increase in the number
    of clients who went out of business or no longer had any
    employees compared to fiscal 2007.

Growth opportunities continue to exist in our target market of
    small- to medium-sized businesses, and accordingly we continue
    to increase the size of our various sales forces. The following
    table summarizes the expected composition of our sales force in
    the year ending May 31, 2009 (“fiscal 2009”) with
    comparisons from fiscal 2007:

We believe there are opportunities for growth within our current
    client base, as well as with new clients, through increased
    penetration of our payroll and human resource ancillary services
    and products. Ancillary services



effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are
    beneficial to our operating margin. The following statistics

Service and product initiatives:

During
    fiscal 2008, we made investments to broaden our portfolio of
    services and products. This included expanding the services
    offered to our MMS clients to strengthen our
    software-as-a-service solution to meet the payroll and human
    resource administrative needs of our clients. These enhancements
    include the following:

•

Acquired BeneTrac, a powerful web-based employee benefits
    management and administration system, and provided enhanced
    integration with the Paychex
    Preview

®

software.

•

Entered into a strategic alliance with Taleo Corporation to
    offer Taleo’s online recruiting and hiring management tools
    to help our clients hire and retain talented employees.

•

Offered Paychex Preview software in a secure web-hosted
    environment as an alternative to the traditional PC-based system.

•

Introduced our Workers’ Compensation Payment Service to our
    MMS clients.

In addition, other fiscal 2008 initiatives included the
    following:

•

Continued expansion of our health insurance services nationwide,
    simplifying the process for our clients in obtaining coverage
    through our network of national and regional insurers.

•

Ongoing enhancements to our 401(k) products to increase
    functionality and flexibility, strengthening our position as the
    market leader and maintaining the highest level of client
    retention of any of our products.

•

Introduced a Flexible Spending Account debit card offering
    clients’ employees an easy, convenient way to access their
    funds.

Business acquisitions:

We may
    supplement our growth from time to time through strategic
    acquisitions when opportunities arise. In August 2007, we
    acquired Hawthorne Benefit Technologies, Inc. and its BeneTrac
    technology, a powerful web-based employee benefits management
    and administrative system, previously mentioned as an
    enhancement to services for our MMS clients.

Focus on customer service:

We have
    always focused on customer service and the maximization of
    client retention. For fiscal 2008, client satisfaction results
    were at an all-time high and client retention was approximately
    80% of our beginning of the year client base.

Financial position:

As of May 31,
    2008, we maintained a strong financial position with cash and
    total corporate investments of $434.8 million. Our primary
    source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from
    operations increased 15% to $724.7 million for fiscal 2008.
    Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases,
    and dividend payments from our operating activities. It is
    anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of
    May 31, 2008, along with projected operating cash flows,
    will support our normal business operations, capital purchases,
    and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.

For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal
    years 2008, 2007, and 2006, and our financial position as of
    May 31, 2008, refer to the tables and analysis in the
    “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and
    Capital Resources” sections of this Item 7 and the
    discussion in the “Critical Accounting Policies”
    section of this Item 7.



Investment
    Portfolio Overview

We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income
    securities, primarily with AAA and AA ratings and short-term
    securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings. We have no exposure to any sub-prime mortgage
    securities, auction rate securities, asset-backed securities or
    asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations,
    enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured
    investment vehicles (SIVs). We do not utilize derivative
    financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.

We exited the auction rate market in the early fall of 2007 and
    have never experienced a failed auction. Our variable rate
    demand notes (“VRDNs”) are rated

A-1/P-1

and
    must have a liquidity facility issued by highly rated financial
    institutions. Our current exposure to VRDN bond insurers is
    limited to Financial Security Assurance (“FSA”).

Outlook

Our current outlook for fiscal 2009 is based upon current
    economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no
    significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding
    guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on
    future changes to interest rates. We estimate the earnings
    effect of a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in the



Federal Funds rate at the present time would be approximately
    $4.5 million, after taxes, for the next twelve-month
    period. Projected revenue and net income growth for fiscal 2009
    are as follows:

Growth in operating income, net of certain items, is expected to
    approximate 13% for fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate
    is expected to approximate 34% throughout fiscal 2009. The tax
    rate is higher than for fiscal 2008 due to anticipated lower
    levels of tax-exempt income from securities held in our
    investment portfolios.

Interest on funds held for clients and investment income are
    expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility. Based upon
    current interest rate and economic conditions, we expect
    interest on funds held for clients and investment income, net,
    to decrease by the following amounts in the respective quarters
    of fiscal 2009:

Our stock repurchase program commenced in August 2007 and
    completed in December 2007 is expected to impact net income and
    diluted earnings per share growth for the first two quarters of
    fiscal 2009, with diluted earnings per share growing at a higher
    rate than net income. Fiscal 2009 diluted weighted-average
    shares outstanding are expected to be comparable to the diluted
    weighted-average shares outstanding for the three months ended
    May 31, 2008.

Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2009 are expected
    to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million.
    Fiscal 2009 depreciation expense is projected to be
    approximately $68 million, and we project amortization of
    intangible assets for fiscal 2009 to be approximately
    $20 million.

Revenue:

Payroll service revenue
    increased 8% for fiscal 2008 and 9% for fiscal 2007 to
    $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The
    increases in Payroll service revenue were primarily attributable
    to client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and
    growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services. In
    fiscal 2008, we had seen signs of a weakening economy, indicated
    by a more difficult than normal third quarter selling season and
    increases in clients going out of business or no longer having
    any employees.

As of May 31, 2008, 93% of clients utilized our payroll tax
    administration services compared with 93% as of May 31,
    2007 and 92% as of May 31, 2006. Our employee payment
    services were utilized by 73% of our clients as of May 31,
    2008, compared with 71% as of May 31, 2007 and 68% as of
    May 31, 2006. Nearly all new clients purchase our payroll
    tax administration services and more than 80% of new clients
    select a form of our employee payment services.

Human Resource Services revenue increased 19% for fiscal 2008
    and 22% for fiscal 2007 to $471.8 million and
    $396.2 million, respectively. The following factors
    contributed to Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal

In addition, revenue from health and benefits services was
    $12.3 million for fiscal 2008, a 93% increase from fiscal
    2007, and revenue from BeneTrac was $8.4 million for fiscal
    2008.

The decrease in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal
    2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was the result of lower average
    interest rates earned offset by higher average investment
    balances and higher realized gains on sales of
    available-for-sale securities. Interest on funds held for
    clients increased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as a



result of higher average interest rates earned and higher
    average investment balances. The higher average investment
    balances in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were driven by
    client base growth, wage inflation, check volume growth within
    our current client base, and increased utilization of our
    payroll tax administration services and employee payment
    services. Refer to the “Market Risk Factors” section,
    contained in Item 7A of this

Form 10-K,

During fiscal 2007, we recorded an expense charge of
    $38.0 million to increase our litigation reserve to account
    for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to pending
    legal matters. Refer to Note M of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for additional information on pending legal matters.

Excluding the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve,
    combined operating and SG&A expenses increased 8% for
    fiscal 2008 and 12% for fiscal 2007. This was primarily the
    result of increases in personnel and other costs related to
    selling and retaining clients, and promoting new services.
    Fiscal 2008 expense growth benefited from continued leveraging
    in response to weakening economic conditions. Fiscal 2007 was
    impacted by the recognition of $25.7 million of expense
    related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004)
    (“SFAS No. 123R”), “Share-Based
    Payment.” Fiscal 2007 growth rates were also impacted by
    comparison to higher than normal levels of sales expense for
    fiscal 2006 as our sales force exceeded its targets. As of
    May 31, 2008, we had approximately 12,200 employees
    compared with approximately 11,700 as of May 31, 2007 and
    10,900 as of May 31, 2006.

Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings,
    furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software.
    Increases in depreciation expense were due to higher levels of
    capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued
    to grow our business. Amortization of intangible assets is
    primarily related to client lists acquisitions, which are
    amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods.
    Amortization increased in fiscal 2008 as a result of intangibles
    from acquisitions during the fiscal year. Amortization increased
    in fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our
    client-servicing arrangement with New England Business Services,
    Inc.
    (“NEBS

®

”)
    and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients.
    Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and
    supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional
    services, and other costs incurred to support our business.

Operating income:

Operating income
    growth was 18% for fiscal 2008 and 8% for fiscal 2007. The
    increases in operating income for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007
    were attributable to the factors previously discussed.



Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on
    funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to
    increase the litigation reserve. Refer to the discussion of
    operating income, net of certain items, in the

The growth in operating income, net of certain items, for fiscal

    effective June 1, 2006, requiring recognition of
    $25.7 million of stock-based compensation costs in fiscal
    2007. No stock-based compensation costs were recognized in the
    results of operations for fiscal 2006.

Investment income, net:

Investment
    income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and
    cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale
    securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds
    held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The
    decrease in investment income for fiscal 2008 compared with
    fiscal 2007 was primarily due to lower average investment
    balances, resulting from the funding of the stock repurchase
    program. The increase in investment income for fiscal 2007
    compared with fiscal 2006 was mainly due to higher average
    interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances
    resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing
    operations.

Income taxes:

Our effective income tax
    rate was 32.6% for fiscal 2008, compared with 30.7% for fiscal
    2007, and 31.1% for fiscal 2006. The increase in our effective
    income tax rate for fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of
    lower levels of tax-exempt income, which is derived primarily
    from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and
    corporate investment portfolios, and a higher effective state
    income tax rate as a result of the adoption of Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109.” The decrease in our effective income tax
    rate for fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of higher levels
    of tax-exempt income and a lower effective state income tax
    rate. For fiscal 2008 and 2007, the effective tax rate was
    impacted by non-deductible compensation related to incentive
    stock option grants. Refer to Note I of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K,

for additional disclosures on income taxes.

Net income and earnings per share:

Net
    income growth was 12% for fiscal 2008 and 11% for fiscal 2007
    increasing to $576.1 million and $515.4 million,
    respectively. These increases were attributable to the factors
    previously discussed, including, in fiscal 2007, the increase to
    the litigation reserve of $38.0 million. Fiscal 2007 growth
    was also impacted by the $25.7 million of stock-based
    compensation costs due to the June 1, 2006 adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. Diluted earnings per share increased
    16% in fiscal 2008 to $1.56 per share and 11% in fiscal 2007 to
    $1.35 per share. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2008
    increased at a rate higher than net income growth due to a lower
    number of weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from the
    stock repurchase program.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

As of May 31, 2008, we had $434.8 million in cash and
    total corporate investments. Cash and total corporate
    investments as of May 31, 2008, along with projected
    operating cash flows, are expected to support our normal
    business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments
    for the foreseeable future.



Commitments
    and Contractual Obligations

As of May 31, 2008, we had unused borrowing capacity
    available under four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of
    credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions
    as follows:

Financial institution

Our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are
    secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between
    Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the
    “Lenders”), pursuant to which we have granted each of
    the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment
    securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
    custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and
    is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the
    Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may
    require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account
    into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual
    Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
    short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
    overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from
    electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the
    ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were
    outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2008 or
    as of May 31, 2008.

As of May 31, 2008, we had irrevocable standby letters of
    credit outstanding totaling $71.5 million, required to
    secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies and
    bonding requirements. These letters of credit expire at various
    dates between July 2008 and December 2012 and are secured by
    securities held in our investment portfolios. No amounts were
    outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2008 or as
    of May 31, 2008.

We have entered into various operating leases and purchase
    obligations that, under GAAP, are not reflected on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2008. The table
    below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under
    these commitments, as well as other contractual obligations
    shown as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
    of May 31, 2008:

The liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately
    $17.7 million as of May 31, 2008, including tax,
    penalty, and interest. We adopted FIN 48 on June 1,
    2007 and increased the liability to $10.9 million. Refer to
    Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for more information on income taxes. We are not able to
    reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows and have
    excluded these liabilities from the table above. However, at
    this time, we do not expect a significant payment relating to
    these obligations within the next year.

Advantage has license agreements with independently owned
    associate offices (“Associates”), which are
    responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services
    and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex,
    Inc. and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll
    processing and payroll tax administration services. Under these
    arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates commissions based on
    processing activity for the related clients. Since the actual
    amounts of future payments are uncertain, obligations under
    these arrangements are not included in the table above.
    Commission expense for the Associates for fiscal 2008 and fiscal
    2007 was $15.3 million and $15.2 million, respectively.

We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance
    contracts for clients who financed their service contracts
    through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make
    representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of
    services under service arrangements with clients. In addition,
    we have entered into indemnification agreements with our
    officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if
    necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or
    future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to
    us. Historically, there have been no material losses related to
    such guarantees and indemnifications.

We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various
    insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans.
    Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements
    is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been
    material. We also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our
    purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for
    employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty
    liability, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles
    and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance
    company.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in
    transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special
    purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would
    have been established for the purpose of facilitating
    off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do
    maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing
    projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations.
    These investments are accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting.

Reclassification
    Within Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

Client fund obligations represent our contractual obligation to
    remit funds to satisfy clients’ payroll and tax payment
    obligations. To better reflect the nature of these activities,
    we have reclassified the net change in client fund obligations
    in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from investing
    activities to financing activities for all periods presented.
    This reclassification had no impact on the net change in cash
    and cash equivalents or cash flows from operating activities for
    any periods presented. Refer to Note B to the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K,

for more information on this reclassification.

The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 and
    fiscal 2007 reflects higher net income adjusted for non-cash
    items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The
    decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income for fiscal 2008
    was primarily attributable to the expense charge of
    $38.0 million to increase the litigation reserve in fiscal
    2007, offset by an increase in the provision for deferred income
    taxes. The increase in non-cash adjustment for fiscal 2007 was
    primarily attributable to the charge to increase the litigation
    reserve and $25.7 million in stock-based compensation costs
    due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. The fluctuations
    in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were
    primarily related to lower interest receivable balances in
    fiscal 2008 and the timing of collection and payments for
    compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.

Funds held for clients and corporate
    investments:

Funds held for clients are
    primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale
    securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of
    available-for-sale securities. The portfolio of funds held for
    clients and corporate investments is detailed in Note E of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate
    investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases,
    sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of funds held
    for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client
    funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or
    regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and
    to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. For
    fiscal 2008, the net change in funds held for clients and
    corporate investments also reflected the effects of the
    $1.0 billion stock repurchase program as funds used for
    this program were not invested in securities. Additional
    discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in
    the “Market Risk Factors” section, contained in
    Item 7A of this

Form 10-K.

Purchases of long-lived assets:

To
    support our continued client and ancillary product growth,
    purchases of property and equipment were made for data
    processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and
    upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal 2008,
    fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006, we purchased approximately
    $4.4 million, $2.8 million, and $4.6 million,
    respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC
    Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive
    Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board.
    Construction in progress totaled $52.1 million and
    $46.5 million as of May 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Of these costs, $51.6 million and
    $39.5 million represent software being developed for
    internal use as of May 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for
    its intended use, at which time we begin amortization of the
    costs. We expect amortization of a significant portion of the
    internal use software costs in construction in progress to begin
    in fiscal 2009, and to be amortized over fifteen years.

Other assets increased for fiscal 2008 due to purchases of
    customer lists. Other assets increased for fiscal 2007 mainly
    due to the termination of our client-servicing arrangement with
    NEBS and the purchasing of the right to service the related
    clients. During fiscal 2008, we paid $32.9 million related
    to acquisitions of businesses, compared with $3.1 million
    and $0.7 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Net change in client fund
    obligations:

The client fund obligations
    liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client
    funds, and the related required remittance of funds to
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax
    administration services and to employees of clients utilizing
    employee payment services. Collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days.

Repurchases of common stock:

During
    fiscal 2008, we completed our stock repurchase program, which
    commenced in August 2007, and repurchased 23.7 million
    shares for a total of $1.0 billion.

Dividends paid:

In July 2007, our Board
    approved an increase of 43% in the quarterly dividend payment to
    $0.30 per share from $0.21 per share. In October 2006, our Board
    approved an increase of 31% in the quarterly dividend payment to
    $0.21 per share from $0.16 per share. The dividends paid as a
    percentage of net income totaled 77%, 58%, and 50% for fiscal
    2008, fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006, respectively. The payment of
    future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash
    flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board.

Exercise of stock options:

The increase
    in proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2008
    compared with fiscal 2007, and for fiscal 2007 compared with
    fiscal 2006, was primarily due to an increase in the number of
    stock options exercised and an increase in the average exercise
    price per share. Common shares acquired through exercise of
    stock options for fiscal 2008 were 2.0 million shares
    compared with 1.8 million shares for fiscal 2007 and
    1.7 million shares for fiscal 2006. We have recognized an
    excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of
    $9.1 million for fiscal 2008 and $9.7 million for
    fiscal 2007 that is reflected in cash flows from financing
    activities in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, as
    adopted on June 1, 2006. For fiscal 2006, we recognized tax
    benefits related to exercise of stock options of
    $11.6 million that are reflected in cash flows from
    operating activities. Refer to Note C to the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K,

for additional disclosures on our stock incentive plans.

Other

New accounting pronouncements:

In
    September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” This statement clarifies
    the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008,
    the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)

FAS 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157.” This
    FSP delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for
    items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis, to fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008. We expect to adopt
    SFAS No. 157, except for this deferral, in our fiscal
    year beginning June 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption
    of this statement to have a material effect on our results of
    operations or financial position.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment to FASB Statement
    No. 115.” This statement allows a company to
    irrevocably elect fair value as a measurement attribute for
    certain financial assets and financial liabilities with changes
    in fair value recognized in the results of operations. The
    statement also establishes presentation and disclosure
    requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between
    companies that choose different measurement



attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. We expect to adopt
    SFAS No. 159 in our fiscal year beginning June 1,
    2008. We do not expect this statement to have a material effect
    on our results of operations or financial position.

In June 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

No. 06-11

(“EITF 06-11”),

“Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards.”

EITF 06-11

applies to share-based payment arrangements, with dividend
    protection features, that entitle an employee to receive
    dividends or dividend equivalents on nonvested equity-based
    shares or units, when those dividends or dividend equivalents
    are charged to retained earnings and result in an income tax
    deduction for the employer under SFAS No. 123R. Under

EITF 06-11,

a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend
    equivalents charged to retained earnings and paid to an employee
    for nonvested equity-based shares or units should be recognized
    as an increase in additional paid-in capital.

EITF 06-11

was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2007 with early adoption permitted.

EITF 06-11

was adopted on June 1, 2007 and did not have a material
    effect on our results of operations or financial position.

In June 2007, the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) issued Statement of Position

No. 07-1,

“Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting
    Guide

Investment Companies

and Accounting by Parent
    Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in
    Investment Companies”

(“SOP 07-1”).

SOP 07-1

clarifies when an entity may apply the provisions of the AICPA
    Audit and Accounting Guide

Investment Companies

and
    addresses the retention of specialized investment company
    accounting by a parent company in consolidation or by an equity
    method investor.

SOP 07-1,

as issued, was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2007, and was applicable for our fiscal year
    beginning June 1, 2008.

SOP 07-1

was indefinitely deferred by the FASB in February 2008.

In December 2007, the FASB issued the following statements of
    financial accounting standards applicable to business
    combinations:

•

SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007)
    (“SFAS No. 141R”), “Business
    Combinations;” and

•

SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of
    ARB No. 51.”

SFAS No. 141R provides guidance on how an entity will
    recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired
    (including goodwill), liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling
    interests, if any, acquired in a business combination.
    SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting and reporting
    for minority interests, which will be treated as noncontrolling
    interests and classified as a component of equity. Both
    standards are effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008, and are applicable to our fiscal year
    beginning June 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. We
    are currently evaluating both standards but do not expect their
    adoption to have a material effect on our results of operations
    or financial position.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets.” This guidance is intended to improve the
    consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible
    asset under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” and the period of expected cash flows
    used to measure the fair value of the asset under
    SFAS No. 141R when the underlying arrangement includes
    renewal or extension of terms that would require substantial
    costs or result in a material modification to the asset upon
    renewal or extension. Companies estimating the useful life of a
    recognized intangible asset must now consider their historical
    experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or, in
    the absence of historical experience, must consider assumptions
    that market participants would use about renewal or extension as
    adjusted for SFAS No. 142’s entity-specific
    factors. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008, and is applicable to our fiscal
    year beginning June 1, 2009. We do not anticipate that the
    adoption of this FSP will have an impact on our results of
    operations or financial condition.

In March 2008 and May 2008, respectively, the FASB issued the
    following statements of financial accounting standards, neither
    of which is anticipated to have any impact to our results of
    operations or financial position:

•

SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of
    FASB Statement No. 133;” and



•

SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles.”

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained
    in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex, Inc.
    Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
    The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
    make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an
    ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates
    used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base
    our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and
    assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and
    circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from
    these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed
    critical to our results of operations or financial position are
    discussed below.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenue is
    recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
    service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
    or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Certain processing services are provided under annual service
    arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
    service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to
    payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a
    fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per
    processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction
    processed. The revenue earned from delivery service for the
    distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is
    included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are
    included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
    Income.

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net
    of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes,
    benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct
    costs billed and incurred were $2.6 billion,
    $2.6 billion, and $2.4 billion for fiscal 2008, 2007,
    and 2006, respectively.

Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized
    using the residual method when all of the following are present:
    persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, typically a
    non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the
    software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free
    of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in
    conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance
    solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is
    recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

In certain situations we allow a client a right of return or
    refund. We maintain an allowance for returns, which is based on
    historical data. The allowance is reviewed periodically for
    adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in the results
    of operations for the period in which the adjustment is
    identified.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
    that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
    administration services and for employee payment services, and
    invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on
    these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and
    remitting of these funds are critical components of providing
    these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
    net realized gains and losses from the sales of
    available-for-sale securities.

PEO workers’ compensation
    insurance:

Workers’ compensation
    insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated
    costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves
    include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those
    claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain
    expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In
    establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves,
    we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future
    cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
    and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
    actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
    multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes
    in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could
    materially impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may
    vary from our present estimates, particularly when those
    payments may not occur until well into the future.



We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’
    compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously
    established reserves are reflected in the results of operations
    for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such
    adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
    variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

In fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, workers’ compensation
    insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on
    claims paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims liability
    was $1,000,000 under the fiscal 2008 policy and $750,000 under
    the fiscal 2007 policy.

    Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation claims as of:

Valuation of investments:

Our
    investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at
    fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair
    value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases
    in the fair value are included in comprehensive income, net of
    tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of
    investments impact our net income only when such investments are
    sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on
    the sale of securities are determined by specific identification
    of the security’s cost basis. On our Consolidated
    Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held
    for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients,
    whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are
    included in investment income, net.

We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our
    available-for-sale securities from the possible inability of
    borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to
    mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality
    securities with AAA and AA ratings, and short-term securities
    with

A-1/P-1

ratings, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any
    single issuer. We periodically review our investment portfolio
    to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily
    impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential
    valuation concerns, which would require us to record an
    impairment charge in the period any such determination is made.
    In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the
    duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is
    less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit
    rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold
    the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or
    maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not
    other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due
    to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption
    related to any particular investment.

Goodwill and other intangible
    assets:

We have $433.3 million of
    goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    May 31, 2008, resulting from acquisitions of businesses.
    Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment on
    an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
    circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a
    potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.
    Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including
    goodwill. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result,
    substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one
    reporting unit. We perform our annual review in our fiscal
    fourth quarter. Based on the results of our goodwill impairment
    review, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of
    operations for fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007. Subsequent to this
    review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate
    any potential impairment of our goodwill balance.

We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable.

Accrual for client fund losses:

We
    maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our
    clients’ inability to meet their payroll obligations. As
    part of providing payroll, payroll tax administration services,
    and employee payment services, we are authorized by the client
    to initiate money transfers from the client’s account for
    the amount of tax obligations and employees’ direct
    deposits. Electronic money fund transfers from client bank



accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from
    clients’ insufficient funds to cover such transfers. We
    evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and
    analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically
    reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the
    clients.

Contingent liabilities:

We are subject
    to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal
    course of business. As of May 31, 2008, we had
    approximately $23.0 million of reserves for pending
    litigation. Based on the application of SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies,” which requires us to
    record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is
    probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably
    estimated, we deem this amount adequate. The determination of
    whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the
    amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires
    considerable judgment. This reserve may change in the future due
    to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions
    related to any particular matter. In light of the litigation
    reserve recorded, we currently believe that resolution of these
    matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position or results of operations. However, these matters are
    subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the
    possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could
    have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our
    results of operations in the period in which any such effect is
    recorded. For additional information regarding pending legal
    matters, refer to Note M in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Stock-based compensation
    costs:

Effective June 1, 2006, we
    adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires that all
    stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock
    options, be recognized as compensation costs in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of
    the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option
    grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model
    requires various assumptions as inputs including expected
    volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life.
    We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical
    volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market
    volatility, both over a period equal to the expected option
    life. We estimate expected option life based on historical
    exercise behavior.

Under SFAS No. 123R, we are required to estimate
    forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards
    that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were
    determined based on type of award and historical experience.
    Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a
    significant change is identified with any

catch-up

adjustment recorded in the period of change, with the final
    adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal
    actual forfeitures.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in our results of operations.

We have determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
    as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application,
    is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option
    grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our
    choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model
    if additional information becomes available in the future
    indicating that another model would provide a more accurate
    estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants
    would warrant such a change.

Income taxes:

We account for deferred
    taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
    included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax
    returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are determined based on the difference between the financial
    statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
    tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to
    the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain
    stock-based awards. At the time of exercise of non-qualified
    stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards, we account
    for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income
    tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any
    excess tax benefit increasing additional paid-in capital. We
    currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in
    additional paid-in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits
    related to stock-based awards. We also maintain a reserve for
    uncertain tax position as a result of the adoption of
    FIN 48 on June 1, 2007.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk Factors

Changes in interest rates and interest rate
    risk:

Funds held for clients are primarily
    comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities.
    Corporate investments are primarily comprised of
    available-for-sale securities. As a result of our operating and
    investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest
    rates that may materially effect our results of operations and
    financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the
    earnings potential of future investments and will cause
    fluctuations in the fair value of our longer-term
    available-for-sale securities. In seeking to minimize the risks

and/or

costs
    associated with such activities, we generally direct investments
    towards high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings
    and short-term securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings. We manage the available-for-sale securities to a
    benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years.

As of May 31, 2008, we had no exposure to any sub-prime
    mortgage securities, auction rate securities, asset-backed
    securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt
    obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or
    structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We do not utilize
    derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate
    risk.

We exited the auction rate market in the early fall of 2007 and
    have never experienced a failed auction. Our VRDNs are rated

A-1/P-1

and
    must have a liquidity facility issued by highly rated financial
    institutions. Our current exposure to VRDN bond insurers is
    limited to FSA.

Our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios
    have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates. During
    fiscal 2008, the average interest rate earned on our combined
    funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was
    3.7% compared with 4.0% for fiscal 2007 and 3.2% for fiscal
    2006. The Federal Funds rate decreased 325 basis points in
    fiscal 2008 and was 2.00% as of May 31, 2008. This compares
    to an increase in the Federal Funds rate of 25 basis points
    in fiscal 2007 and 200 basis points in fiscal 2006. A lower
    Federal Funds rate impacts the average interest rate we earn on
    our portfolios. While interest rates are falling, the full
    impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected
    in net income due to the interaction of long- and short-term
    interest rate changes.

During a falling interest rate environment, the decreases in
    interest rates decrease earnings from our short-term
    investments, and over time will decrease earnings from our
    longer-term available-for-sale securities. Earnings from the
    available-for-sale securities, which as of May 31, 2008 had
    an average duration of 2.7 years, excluding the impact of
    VRDNs tied to short-term interest rates, would not reflect
    decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or
    mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates.

The cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities that
    had stated maturities as of May 31, 2008 are shown below by
    contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from
    contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to
    prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

VRDNs are primarily categorized as due after five years in the
    table above as the contractual maturities on these securities
    are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are
    issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as
    short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through
    the tender feature.

Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates
    involves many factors. These factors include, but are not
    limited to:

•

daily interest rate changes;

•

seasonal variations in investment balances;

•

actual duration of short-term and available-for-sale securities;

•

the proportional mix of taxable and tax-exempt
    investments; and

•

changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment
    rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous.

Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change in taxable
    interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates
    by approximately 17 basis points.

Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and
    corporate investments) averaged approximately $4.1 billion
    for fiscal 2008. Our normal and anticipated allocation is
    approximately 55% invested in short-term securities and
    available-for-sale securities with an average duration of
    35 days, and 45% invested in available-for-sale securities
    with an average duration of two and one-half to three years.

The combined funds held for clients and corporate
    available-for-sale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of
    $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008, compared with a net
    unrealized loss of $14.9 million as of May 31, 2007.
    The change resulted from decreases in long-term market interest
    rates. During fiscal 2008, the investment portfolios ranged from
    a net unrealized loss of $24.3 million to a net unrealized
    gain of $48.7 million. During fiscal 2007, the net
    unrealized loss ranged from $29.5 million to
    $1.1 million. The net unrealized gain of our investment
    portfolios was approximately $23.3 million as of
    July 11, 2008.

As of May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, we had
    $3.4 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, invested
    in available-for-sale securities at fair value. The
    weighted-average yield-to-maturity was 3.4% and 3.7%, as of
    May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, respectively. The
    weighted-average yield-to-maturity excludes available-for-sale
    securities tied to short-term interest rates such as auction
    securities and VRDNs. Assuming a hypothetical decrease in both
    short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis
    points, the resulting potential increase in fair value for our
    portfolio of available-for-sale securities as of May 31,
    2008, would be approximately $12.0 million. Conversely, a
    corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a
    comparable decrease in fair value. This hypothetical increase or
    decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as
    an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value, with an
    offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity. These
    fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate
    impact on the results of operations, unless any declines in fair
    value were considered to be other-than-temporary.

Credit risk:

We are exposed to credit
    risk in connection with these investments through the possible
    inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We
    attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high
    credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term
    securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any
    single issuer.

REPORT ON
    MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Paychex, Inc. (the “Company”) is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system
    of internal control over financial reporting as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Our internal control over
    financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits
    and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
    guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified
    personnel, and a written Code of Business Ethics and Conduct
    adopted by our Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to
    all Company Directors and all officers and employees of our
    Company.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
    even when determined to be effective, can only provide
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

The Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors
    meets with the independent public accountants, management, and
    internal auditors periodically to discuss internal control over
    financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting
    matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent public
    accountants the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit
    Committee also meets periodically with the independent public
    accountants and the chief internal auditor without management
    present to ensure that the independent public accountants and
    the chief internal auditor have free access to the Audit
    Committee. The Audit Committee’s Report can be found in the
    Definitive Proxy Statement to be issued in connection with the
    Company’s 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
    2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
    set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission in “Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework.” Based on our assessment, management
    believes that the Company maintained effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of May 31, 2008.

The Company’s independent public accountants,
    Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting
    firm, are appointed by its Audit Committee. Ernst &
    Young LLP has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial
    Statements of Paychex, Inc., management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting and the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the
    independent public accountants are contained in this Annual
    Report on

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Audit Committee of the Board of Directors

and the Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Paychex, Inc. as of May 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
    Paychex, Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Paychex, Inc. at May 31, 2008 and
    2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial
    statements, on June 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123R, “Share Based
    Payment.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Paychex, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of May 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated July 14, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Audit Committee of the Board of Directors

and the Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited Paychex, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 31, 2008, based on criteria
    established in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    Paychex Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on
    Management’s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Paychex, Inc. maintained, in all material

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A —

Description
    of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Paychex, Inc.
    and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company” or
    “Paychex”) is a leading provider of comprehensive
    payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits
    outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses in
    the United States (“U.S.”). The Company also has a
    subsidiary in Germany.

Paychex, a Delaware corporation formed in 1979, reports as one
    segment. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is
    generated within the U.S. The Company also generates
    revenue within Germany, which was less than one percent of its
    total revenue for the years ended May 31, 2008
    (“fiscal 2008”) and 2007 (“fiscal 2007”).
    Long-lived assets in Germany are insignificant in relation to
    total long-lived assets of the Company as of May 31, 2008.

Total revenue is comprised of service revenue and interest on
    funds held for clients. Service revenue is comprised of the
    Payroll and Human Resource Services portfolios of services and
    products. Payroll service revenue is earned primarily from
    payroll processing, payroll tax administration services,
    employee payment services, and other ancillary services. Payroll
    processing services include the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; preparation of
    federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
    and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations.

In connection with the automated payroll tax administration
    services, the Company electronically collects payroll taxes from
    clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepares and
    files the applicable tax returns, and remits taxes to the
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due
    dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and
    30 days after receipt, with some items extending to
    90 days. The Company handles all regulatory correspondence,
    amendments, and penalty and interest disputes, and is subject to
    cash penalties imposed by tax or regulatory agencies for late
    filings and late or under payment of taxes. With employee
    payment services, employers are offered the option of paying
    their employees by direct deposit, Chase Pay Card

Plus

, a
    check drawn on a Paychex account
    (Readychex

®

),
    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by Paychex. For the first three methods,
    net payroll is collected electronically from the clients’
    bank account, typically one day before payday, and provides
    payment to the employee on payday.

In addition to service fees paid by clients, the Company earns
    interest on funds held for clients that are collected before due
    dates and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or
    regulatory agencies or client employees. The funds held for
    clients and related client fund obligations are included in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as current assets and current
    liabilities. The amount of funds held for clients and related
    client fund obligations varies significantly during the year.

The Human Resource Services service and product line provides
    small- to medium-sized businesses with retirement services
    administration, workers’ compensation insurance services,
    health and benefit services, time and attendance solutions, and
    other human resource services and products. The Company’s
    Paychex
    Premier

®

Human Resource Services (“Paychex Premier”) provides a
    combined package of services that include payroll, employer
    compliance, human resource and employee benefits administration,
    risk management outsourcing, and the

on-site

availability of a professionally trained human resource services
    representative. This comprehensive bundle of services is
    designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
    payroll and related benefits costs while providing a benefits
    package equal to that of larger companies. The Company also
    operates a Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”),
    which provides primarily the same services as Paychex Premier,
    except Paychex serves as a co-employer of the clients’
    employees, assumes the risks and rewards of workers’
    compensation insurance, and provides more sophisticated health
    care offerings to PEO clients.

Principles of consolidation:

The
    Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash and
    cash equivalents consist of available cash, money market
    securities, and other investments with a maturity of three
    months or less as of the balance sheet date. Amounts reported in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value.

Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful
    accounts:

Accounts receivable balances are
    shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts of $4.1 million as of May 31,
    2008 and $3.3 million as of May 31, 2007. Amounts
    reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair
    value. No single client had a material impact on total accounts
    receivable, service revenue, or results of operations.

Funds held for clients and corporate
    investments:

Marketable securities included
    in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist
    primarily of securities classified as available-for-sale and are
    recorded at fair value obtained from an independent pricing
    service. These investment portfolios also include cash, money
    market securities, and short-term investments. Unrealized gains
    and losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported as
    comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Realized gains and losses on the
    sales of securities are determined by specific identification of
    the cost basis of each security. On the Consolidated Statements
    of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients
    are included in interest on funds held for clients and realized
    gains and losses from corporate investments are included in
    investment income, net.

Concentrations:

Substantially all of
    the Company’s deposited cash is maintained at two large
    credit-worthy financial institutions. These deposits may exceed
    the amount of any insurance provided. All of the Company’s
    deliverable securities are held in custody with one of the two
    aforementioned financial institutions, for which that
    institution bears the risk of custodial loss. Non-deliverable
    securities, primarily time deposits and money market securities,
    are restricted to credit-worthy broker-dealers and financial
    institutions.

Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation:

Property and equipment is stated at cost,
    less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
    based on the estimated useful lives of property and equipment
    using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of
    depreciable assets are generally ten to 35 years, or the
    remaining life, whichever is shorter, for buildings and
    improvements; two to seven years for data processing equipment;
    three to five years for software; seven years for furniture and
    fixtures; and ten years or the life of the lease, whichever is
    shorter, for leasehold improvements. Normal and recurring repair
    and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. The
    Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment,
    including capitalized software, for impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
    such assets may not be recoverable.

Software development and
    enhancements:

Expenditures for software
    purchases and software developed for internal use are
    capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives, which are generally three to five years,
    except for substantial changes in the functionality of
    processing applications, for which the estimated useful life may
    be longer. For software developed for internal use, costs are
    capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use.” Capitalized internal use
    software costs include external direct costs of materials and
    services associated with developing or obtaining the software,
    and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are
    directly associated with internal-use software projects.
    Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at
    which the project is substantially complete and ready for its
    intended use. Costs associated with preliminary project stage
    activities, training, maintenance, and other post-implementation
    stage activities are expensed as incurred. The carrying value of
    software and development costs, along with other long-lived
    assets, is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets
    may not be recoverable.

Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated
    amortization:

The Company has recorded
    goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of businesses.
    Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment
    on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs
    or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been
    a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.
    Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including
    goodwill. The Company’s



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially
    all the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. The
    Company performs its annual impairment testing in its fiscal
    fourth quarter. Based on the Company’s review, no
    impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for
    fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007. Subsequent to this review, there
    have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential
    impairment of the Company’s goodwill balance.

Intangible assets are primarily comprised of client list
    acquisitions and license agreements with independently owned
    associate offices and are reported net of accumulated
    amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Intangible
    assets are amortized over periods generally ranging from five to
    twelve years using either the straight-line method, an
    accelerated method, or based on client attrition. The Company
    tests intangible assets for potential impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
    such assets may not be recoverable.

Other long-term assets:

Other long-term
    assets are primarily related to the Company’s investment as
    a limited partner in various low-income housing partnerships.
    These partnerships were determined to be variable interest
    entities. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these
    variable interest entities and, therefore, does not consolidate
    them in its results of operations and financial position. The
    investments in these partnerships are accounted for under the
    equity method, with the Company’s share of partnership
    losses recorded in investment income, net on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. The net investment in these entities
    recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was
    $2.5 million as of May 31, 2008 and $3.5 million
    as of May 31, 2007.

Accrual for client fund losses:

The
    Company maintains an accrual for estimated losses associated
    with its clients’ inability to meet their payroll
    obligations. As part of providing payroll, payroll tax
    administration services, and employee payment services, the
    Company is authorized by the client to initiate money transfers
    from the client’s account for the amount of tax obligations
    and employees’ direct deposits. Electronic money fund
    transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential
    risk of loss resulting from clients’ insufficient funds to
    cover such transfers. The Company evaluates certain uncollected
    amounts on a specific basis and analyzes historical experience
    for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the
    likelihood of recovery from the clients.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenue is
    recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
    service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
    or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Certain processing services are provided under annual service
    arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
    service period. The Company’s service revenue is largely
    attributable to payroll-related processing services where the
    fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed
    amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or
    transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service
    for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and
    reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the
    delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net
    of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes,
    benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct
    costs billed and incurred were $2.6 billion,
    $2.6 billion, and $2.4 billion for fiscal 2008, fiscal
    2007, and the year ended May 31, 2006 (“fiscal
    2006”), respectively.

Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized
    using the residual method when all of the following are present:
    persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, typically a
    non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the
    software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free
    of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by the
    Company’s clients in conjunction with their purchase of
    certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these
    maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the
    contract.

In certain situations the Company allows a client a right of
    return or refund. The Company maintains an allowance for
    returns, which is based on historical data. The allowance is
    reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to
    revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in
    which the adjustment is identified.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
    that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
    administration services and for employee payment services, and
    invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on
    these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and
    remitting of these funds are critical components of providing
    these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
    net realized gains and losses from the sales of
    available-for-sale securities.

Advantage Payroll Services Inc. (“Advantage”), a
    subsidiary of the Company, has license agreements with
    independently owned associate offices (“Associates”).
    The Associates are responsible for selling and marketing
    Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational
    functions. Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized
    back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration
    services for the Associates, including the billing and
    collection of processing fees and the collection and remittance
    of payroll and payroll tax funds pursuant to Advantage’s
    service arrangement with Associate customers. The marketing and
    selling by the Associates is conducted under their respective
    logos. Commissions earned by the Associates are based on the
    processing activity for the related clients. Revenue generated
    from customers as a result of these relationships and
    commissions paid to Associates are included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income as service revenue and selling, general and
    administrative expense, respectively.

PEO workers’ compensation
    insurance:

Workers’ compensation
    insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated
    costs of paying claims underwritten by the Company. These
    reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for
    those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain
    expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In
    establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves,
    the Company uses an independent actuarial estimate of
    undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle
    the claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
    and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
    actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
    multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes
    in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could
    materially impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may
    vary from the present estimates, particularly when those
    payments may not occur until well into the future.

The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated
    workers’ compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to
    previously established reserves are reflected in the results of
    operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified.
    Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
    variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

In fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, workers’ compensation
    insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on
    claims paid as incurred. The Company’s maximum individual
    claims liability was $1,000,000 under its fiscal 2008 policy and
    $750,000 under its fiscal 2007 policy.

The Company had recorded the following amounts on its

Stock-based compensation
    costs:

Effective June 1, 2006, the
    Company adopted “Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standard” (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004)
    (“SFAS No. 123R”), “Share-Based
    Payment,” which replaces SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and
    supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
    (“APB 25”), “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees.” This statement requires that all stock-based
    awards to employees, including grants of stock options, be
    recognized as compensation costs in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of
    grant. These costs are recognized as expense in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income over the requisite service period and
    increase additional paid-in capital. The Company adopted this
    standard using the modified-prospective transition method, and
    accordingly, results for the prior periods have not been
    restated.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires
    various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of
    the Paychex stock price and expected option life. Volatility is
    estimated based on a combination of historical volatility using
    weekly stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a
    period equal to the expected option life. Expected option life
    is estimated based on historical exercise behavior.

Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company is required to
    estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for
    those awards that are expected to vest. The assumptions for
    forfeitures were determined based on type of award and
    historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at
    the point in time a significant change is identified with any

catch-up

adjustment recorded in the period of change, with the final
    adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal
    actual forfeitures.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in the Company’s results of operations.

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its
    application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of
    stock option grants. The Company periodically reassesses its
    assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will
    reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes
    available in the future indicating that another model would
    provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if
    characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.

Refer to Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion of the Company’s
    stock-based compensation plans.

Income taxes:

The Company accounts for
    deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and
    liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
    that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
    or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
    financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities
    using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. With the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2007, the Company records a
    deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs
    recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of the
    exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of restricted
    stock awards, the Company accounts for the resulting tax
    deduction by reducing its accrued income tax liability with an
    offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit
    increasing additional paid-in capital. The Company currently has
    a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in
    capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to
    stock-based awards. The company also maintains a reserve for
    uncertain tax positions as a result of the adoption of Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109,” effective June 1, 2007.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles requires management to make
    estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported

amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual amounts and results could differ from
    these estimates.

New accounting pronouncements:

In
    September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” This statement clarifies
    the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008,
    the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)

FAS 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157.” This
    FSP delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for
    non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for
    items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
    financial statements on a recurring basis, to fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company expects to
    adopt SFAS No. 157, except for this deferral, in its
    fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. The Company does not
    expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect
    on its results of operations or financial position.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment to FASB Statement
    No. 115.” This statement allows a company to
    irrevocably elect fair value as a measurement attribute for
    certain financial assets and financial liabilities with changes
    in fair value recognized in the results of operations. The
    statement also establishes presentation and disclosure
    requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between
    companies that choose different measurement attributes for
    similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 159 in its
    fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. The Company does not
    expect this statement to have a material effect on its results
    of operations or financial position.

In June 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

No. 06-11

(“EITF 06-11”),

“Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards.”

EITF 06-11

applies to share-based payment arrangements, with dividend
    protection features, that entitle an employee to receive
    dividends or dividend equivalents on nonvested equity-based
    shares or units, when those dividends or dividend equivalents
    are charged to retained earnings and result in an income tax
    deduction for the employer under SFAS No. 123R. Under

EITF 06-11,

a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend
    equivalents charged to retained earnings and paid to an employee
    for nonvested equity-based shares or units should be recognized
    as an increase in additional paid-in capital.

was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2007 with early adoption permitted.

EITF 06-11

was adopted on June 1, 2007 and did not have a material
    effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial
    position.

In June 2007, the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) issued Statement of Position

No. 07-1,

“Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting
    Guide

and Accounting by Parent
    Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in

(“SOP 07-1”).

    Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008.

SOP 07-1

was indefinitely deferred by the FASB in February 2008.

In December 2007, the FASB issued the following statements of
    financial accounting standards applicable to business
    combinations:

•

SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007)
    (“SFAS No. 141R”), “Business
    Combinations;” and

•

SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of
    ARB No. 51.”

SFAS No. 141R provides guidance on how an entity will
    recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired
    (including goodwill), liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling
    interests, if any, acquired in a business combination.
    SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting and reporting
    for minority interests, which will be treated as



PAYCHEX,

noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of
    equity. Both standards are effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008, and are applicable to the
    Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. Early
    adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating both
    standards but does not expect their adoption to have a material
    effect on its results of operations or financial position.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets.” This guidance is intended to improve the
    consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible
    asset under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”, and the period of expected cash flows
    used to measure the fair value of the asset under
    SFAS No. 141R when the underlying arrangement includes
    renewal or extension of terms that would require substantial
    costs or result in a material modification to the asset upon
    renewal or extension. Companies estimating the useful life of a
    recognized intangible asset must now consider their historical
    experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or, in
    the absence of historical experience, must consider assumptions
    that market participants would use about renewal or extension as
    adjusted for SFAS No. 142’s entity-specific
    factors. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008, and is applicable to the
    Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. The
    Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this FSP will
    have an impact on its results of operations or financial
    condition.

In March 2008 and May 2008, respectively, the FASB issued the
    following statements of financial accounting standards, neither
    of which is anticipated to have any impact to the Company’s
    results of operations or financial position:

•

SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment of
    FASB Statement No. 133;” and

•

SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles.”

Reclassification
    Within Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

Client fund obligations represent the Company’s contractual
    obligation to remit funds to satisfy clients’ payroll and
    tax payment obligations. To better reflect the nature of these
    activities, the Company has reclassified the net change in
    client fund obligations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows from investing activities to financing activities for all
    periods presented. The impacts of the reclassification to prior
    year periods were as follows:

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

The Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and
    restated (the “2002 Plan”), became effective on
    October 12, 2005 upon its approval by the Company’s
    stockholders. The 2002 Plan authorizes the granting of options
    to purchase up to 29.1 million shares of the Company’s
    common stock. As of May 31, 2008, there were



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

15.1 million shares available for future grants under the
    2002 Plan. No future grants will be made pursuant to the
    Paychex, Inc. 1998 or 1995 Stock Incentive Plans, which expired
    in August 2002 and 1998, respectively. However, options to
    purchase an aggregate of 2.4 million shares under these two
    plans remain outstanding as of May 31, 2008.

As discussed in Note A of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, effective June 1, 2006 (the
    “adoption date”), the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123R. This statement requires that all
    stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock
    options, be recognized as compensation costs in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of
    the date of grant. These costs are recognized as an expense in
    the Consolidated Statements of Income over the requisite service
    period and increase additional paid-in capital.

The Company adopted this standard using the modified-prospective
    transition method, and accordingly, results for prior periods
    have not been restated. Under this transition method, the
    Company recognized for fiscal 2007 and 2008 compensation costs
    for (1) stock-based awards granted after the adoption date
    based on grant date fair value in accordance with the provisions
    of SFAS No. 123R and (2) the unvested portion of
    any grants issued prior to the adoption date based on the grant
    date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
    provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Prior to the adoption date, the Company accounted for
    stock-based compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value
    method described in APB 25 and related interpretations, as
    permitted by SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, no
    compensation costs were recognized for stock option grants
    because the exercise price of the stock options granted was
    equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
    the grant.

Prior to the adoption date, the Company presented all tax
    benefits from the exercise of stock options as cash flows from
    operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires tax benefits in excess
    of compensation costs recognized in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements to be presented as cash flows from financing
    activities. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, excess
    tax benefits recognized in periods after the adoption date have
    been properly classified as cash flows from financing
    activities. Tax benefits recognized in periods prior to the
    adoption date remain classified as cash flows from operating
    activities.

Capitalized stock-based compensation costs related to the
    development of internal use software for fiscal 2008 and fiscal
    2007 were not significant.

Stock-based compensation costs for any awards granted subsequent
    to the adoption date are recognized on a straight-line basis
    over the requisite service period to better align the costs with
    the employee services provided. Compensation costs for
    stock-based awards granted prior to the adoption date will
    continue to be recognized according to an accelerated
    amortization schedule related to the graded vesting terms of the
    grant, as they were for the pro-forma disclosures above.

As of May 31, 2008, the total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to all unvested stock-based awards was
    $63.1 million and is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 2.4 years.

Stock option grants:

Stock option
    grants entitle the holder to purchase, at the end of the vesting
    term, a specified number of shares of Paychex common stock at an
    exercise price per share set equal to the closing market price
    of the common stock on the date of grant. All stock option
    grants have a contractual life of ten years from the date of the
    grant and a vesting schedule as established by the Board of
    Directors (the “Board”). The Company issues new shares
    of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises. Non-qualified
    stock option grants since July 2005 vest 20% per annum, with
    previously granted stock options vesting at 33.3% after two
    years of service from the date of the grant, with annual vesting
    at 33.3% thereafter. Non-qualified stock option grants to the
    Board vest one-third per annum.

Stock option grants are normally approved in July by the Board,
    with a current annual grant guideline of approximately 1% of
    total common stock outstanding. The grant guideline, reviewed
    annually by the Board, does not include broad-based incentive
    stock options granted to virtually all non-management employees
    with at least 90 days of service. The Company has granted
    stock options to employees in the following broad-based

The fair value of stock option grants was estimated at the date
    of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model for grants
    prior to and subsequent to the adoption date. The
    weighted-average assumptions used for valuation under the
    Black-Scholes model for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 (under
    SFAS No. 123R) and for fiscal 2006 (pro-forma impact
    under SFAS No. 123) are as follows:

Risk-free interest rates are yields for zero coupon
    U.S. Treasury notes maturing approximately at the end of
    the expected option life. The estimated volatility factor is
    based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly
    stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a period
    equal to the expected option life. Prior to the adoption

date, the Company had used historical volatility based on
    monthly stock prices. The expected option life is based on
    historical exercise behavior.

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its
    application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of its
    stock option grants. The Company periodically assesses its
    assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will
    reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes
    available in the future indicating that another model would
    provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if
    characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.

Restricted stock awards:

In July 2006
    and July 2007, the Board approved grants of restricted stock
    awards to the Company’s officers and outside directors in
    accordance with the 2002 Plan. All shares underlying awards of
    restricted stock are restricted in that they are not
    transferable until they vest. The recipients of the restricted
    stock have voting rights and earn dividends, which are paid to
    the recipient at the time of vesting of the awards. If the
    recipient leaves Paychex prior to the vesting date for any
    reason, the shares of restricted stock and the dividends accrued
    on those shares will be forfeited and returned to Paychex.

For restricted stock awards granted to officers, the shares vest
    upon the fifth anniversary of the grant date provided the
    recipient is still an employee of the Company on that date.
    These awards have a provision for the acceleration of vesting
    based on achievement of performance targets established by the
    Board. If the established targets are met for a fiscal year,
    one-third of the award will vest. For outside directors, the
    shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. The fair
    value of restricted stock awards is equal to the closing market
    price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant and
    is expensed over the requisite service period on a straight-line
    basis.

Restricted stock units:

In July 2007,
    the Board approved a grant of restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”) to non-officer management. RSUs do not have
    voting rights or earn dividend equivalents during the vesting
    period. These awards vest 20% per annum over five years. The
    fair value of RSUs is equal to the closing market price of the
    underlying common stock as of the date of grant, adjusted for
    the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

The
    Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan to all employees
    under which the Company’s common stock can be purchased
    through a payroll deduction with no discount to the market price
    and no look-back provision. The plan has been deemed
    non-compensatory subject to the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R and, therefore, no stock-based
    compensation costs have been recognized for fiscal 2008 or
    fiscal 2007.

The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these
    investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to
    meet the terms of the bonds. In addition, the Company is exposed
    to interest rate risk, as rate volatility will cause
    fluctuations in the fair value of held investments and in the
    earnings potential of future investments. The Company attempts
    to mitigate these risks by investing primarily in high credit
    quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term
    securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings, limiting amounts that can be invested in any single
    issuer, and by investing in short-to intermediate-term
    instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate
    changes. The Company’s variable rate demand notes
    (“VRDNs”) must have a liquidity facility issued by
    highly rated financial institutions. The Company’s current
    exposure to VRDN bond insurers is limited to Financial Security
    Assurance.

As of May 31, 2008, the Company did not hold any auction
    rate securities. The Company has no exposure to any sub-prime
    mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed
    commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash
    or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles
    (SIVs). The Company does not utilize derivative financial
    instruments to manage interest rate risk.

The Company’s available-for-sale securities reflected a net
    unrealized gain of $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008
    compared with a net unrealized loss of $14.9 million as of
    May 31, 2007. The gross unrealized losses, included in the
    net unrealized gain, as of May 31, 2008 were comprised of
    76 available-for-sale securities, which had a total fair value
    of $243.6 million. The gross unrealized losses, included in
    the net unrealized loss, as of May 31, 2007 were comprised
    of 447 available-for-sale securities with a total fair value of
    $1.6 billion. The securities in an unrealized loss position

The Company periodically reviews its investment portfolio to
    determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired
    due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation
    concerns. The Company believes that the investments it held as
    of May 31, 2008 were not other-than-temporarily impaired.
    While certain available-for-sale securities had fair values that
    were below cost, the Company believes that it was probable that
    the principal and interest would be collected in accordance with
    contractual terms, and that the decline in the fair value was
    due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased
    credit risk. As of May 31, 2008 and 2007, substantially all
    of the securities in an unrealized loss position held an AA
    rating or better. The Company believes that it has the ability
    and intent to hold these investments until the earlier of market
    price recovery or maturity. The Company’s assessment that
    an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could
    change in the future due to new developments or changes in the
    Company’s strategies or assumptions related to any
    particular investment.

On June 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48, and its
    related amendment. These standards prescribe minimum recognition
    thresholds for evaluating uncertain income tax positions, and
    provide guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
    disclosure, and transition. The impact of the adoption mainly
    affected the state income tax rate, net of federal benefit.

Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect
    adjustment by increasing its reserve for uncertain tax positions
    by $8.4 million, with an offsetting decrease to opening
    retained earnings. As of May 31, 2008, the total reserve
    for uncertain tax positions was $17.7 million and is
    included in long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets, as the resolution of these matters is not expected
    within the next twelve months.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the
    Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefit, not including
    interest or other potential offsetting effects, is as follows:

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well
    as income tax in one foreign and numerous state jurisdictions.
    Uncertain tax positions relate primarily to state income tax
    matters. The Company believes it is probable that the reserve
    for uncertain tax positions will increase in the next twelve
    months, resulting from the settlement of open periods and the
    effect of operations on anticipated tax benefits. It is
    anticipated that this increase will impact the tax provision in
    the range of $7.5 million to $9.5 million.

The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax
    matters through its fiscal year ended May 31, 2005, with
    fiscal 2006, 2007, and 2008 still subject to potential audit.
    With limited exception, state income tax audits by taxing
    authorities are closed through fiscal 2003, primarily due to
    expiration of the statute of limitations. Audit outcomes and the
    timing of audit settlements are subject to a high degree of
    uncertainty. As of May 31, 2008, substantially all of the
    $17.7 million reserve for uncertain tax positions, if
    recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective
    income tax rate.

The Company continues to follow its policy of recognizing
    interest and penalties accrued on tax positions as a component
    of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Upon
    adoption, the amount of accrued interest and penalties
    associated with the Company’s tax positions was immaterial
    to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of interest and
    penalties recognized for fiscal 2008 was immaterial to the
    Company’s results of operations.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

401(k) plan:

The Company maintains a
    contributory savings plan that qualifies under
    section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Paychex,
    Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan (the “Plan”)
    allows all employees to immediately participate in the salary
    deferral portion of the Plan, contributing up to a maximum of
    50% of their salary. Employees who have completed one year of
    service are eligible to receive a company matching contribution.
    Beginning in September 2007, the Company matches up to 100% of
    the first 3% of eligible pay and up to 50% of the next 2% of
    eligible pay that an employee contributes to the plan. Prior to
    September 2007, the Company matched 50% of an employee’s
    voluntary contribution up to 6% of eligible pay.

The Plan is 100% participant-directed. Plan participants can
    fully diversify their portfolios by choosing from any or all
    investment fund choices in the Plan. Transfers in and out of
    investment funds, including the Paychex, Inc. Employee Stock
    Ownership Plan (ESOP) Stock Fund, are not restricted in any
    manner. The Company match contribution follows the same fund
    elections as the employee compensation deferrals.

Company contributions to the Plan for fiscal 2008, 2007, and
    2006 were $15.1 million, $10.2 million, and
    $9.1 million, respectively.

Deferred compensation plans:

The
    Company offers a non-qualified and unfunded deferred
    compensation plan to a select group of key employees, executive
    officers, and outside directors. Eligible employees are provided
    with the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual base
    salary and bonus and outside directors to defer 100% of their
    Board cash compensation. Gains and losses are credited based on
    the participant’s election of a variety of investment
    choices. The Company does not match any participant deferral or
    guarantee its return. The amounts accrued under this plan were
    $10.2 million and $9.3 million as of May 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, and are reflected in other long-term
    liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Prior to the April 1, 2003 acquisition, InterPay, Inc.
    (“InterPay”) entered into various salary continuation
    agreements with certain former employees. These agreements
    provide for benefits to these retired employees, and



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in certain cases to their beneficiaries, for life or other
    designated periods through 2015. The amounts accrued under these
    agreements were $1.1 million and $1.3 million as of
    May 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and represent the
    estimated present value of the benefits earned under these
    agreements.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

The
    Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which
    eligible employees may purchase common stock of the Company at
    current market prices with no look-back provision. All
    transactions occur directly through the Company’s transfer
    agent and no brokerage fees are charged to employees, except for
    when stock is sold.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Lines of credit:

As of May 31,
    2008, the Company had unused borrowing capacity available under
    four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market
    rates of interest with financial institutions as follows:

Financial institution

JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.

February 2009

PNC Bank, National Association

$

150 million

February 2009

Wells Fargo Bank, National Association

$

150 million

February 2009

The credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are
    secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between
    Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the
    “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Company has granted
    each of the Lenders a security interest in certain investment
    securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
    custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and
    is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the
    Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may
    require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account
    into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual
    Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
    short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
    overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic
    payment transactions on behalf of clients in the ordinary course
    of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against
    these lines of credit during fiscal 2008 or as of May 31,
    2008.

Letters of credit:

The Company had
    irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling
    $71.5 million and $62.4 million as of May 31,
    2008 and May 31, 2007, respectively, required to secure
    commitments for certain insurance policies and bonding
    requirements. Letters of credit as of May 31, 2008 expire
    at various dates between July 2008 and December 2012 and are
    secured by securities held in the Company’s investment
    portfolios. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of
    credit during fiscal 2008 or as of May 31, 2008.

Contingencies:

The Company is subject
    to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal
    course of its business. These include disputes or potential
    disputes related to breach of contract, employment-related
    claims, tax claims, and other matters.

In August 2001, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,
    Rapid Payroll, Inc. (“Rapid Payroll”) informed 76
    licensees that it intended to stop supporting their payroll
    processing software in August of 2002. Thereafter, lawsuits were
    commenced by licensees asserting various claims, including
    breach of contract and related tort and fraud causes of action.
    As previously reported in the Company’s prior periodic
    reports, these lawsuits sought compensatory damages, punitive
    damages, and injunctive relief against Rapid Payroll, the
    Company, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, and
    its Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. In accordance
    with the Company’s indemnification agreements with its
    senior executives, the Company has agreed to defend and, if
    necessary, indemnify them in connection with these pending
    matters.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At the present time, the Company has fully resolved its
    licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with 74 of
    the 76 licensees who were provided services by Rapid Payroll. In
    2005, a decision favorable to Paychex, Inc. was issued by the
    United States District Court for the Central District of
    California (the “district court”) with respect to the
    Company’s dispute with one of the remaining two licensees.
    On April 18, 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
    affirmed the district court’s ruling enforcing the
    contractual limitation of liability clause, but reversed for
    trial on the issue of tortuous interference with contract. That
    case has been remanded to the district court for further
    proceedings. In 2007, a verdict was issued in the only other
    remaining licensee case, which was pending in California
    Superior Court, Los Angeles County, in which a jury awarded to
    the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory damages and
    subsequently awarded an additional $11.0 million in
    punitive damages. The Company is pursuing an appeal of that
    verdict.

The Company has a reserve for pending litigation matters. The
    litigation reserve has been adjusted in fiscal 2008 to account
    for settlements and incurred litigation expenditures. The
    Company’s reserve for all pending litigation totaled
    $23.0 million as of May 31, 2008, and is included in
    current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In light of the reserve for all pending litigation matters, the
    Company’s management currently believes that resolution of
    outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent
    uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate
    resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact
    on the Company’s financial position and the results of
    operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

Lease commitments:

The Company leases
    office space and data processing equipment under terms of
    various operating leases. Rent expense for fiscal 2008, 2007,
    and 2006 was $44.5 million, $41.4 million, and
    $37.6 million, respectively. As of May 31, 2008,
    future minimum lease payments under various non-cancelable
    operating leases with terms of more than one year are as follows:

    orders and legally binding contractual arrangements with minimum
    future payment obligations of approximately $62.2 million,

    assets. These minimum future payment obligations relate to the

PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company guarantees performance of service on annual
    maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service
    contracts through a third party. In the normal course of
    business, the Company makes representations and warranties that
    guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements
    with clients. In addition, the Company has entered into
    indemnification agreements with its officers and directors,
    which require the Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify
    these individuals for certain pending or future claims as they
    relate to their services provided to the Company. Historically,
    there have been no material losses related to such guarantees
    and indemnifications.

Paychex currently self-insures the deductible portion of various
    insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. The
    Company’s estimated loss exposure under these insurance
    arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued
    have not been material. The Company also maintains insurance
    coverage in addition to its purchased primary insurance policies
    for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and
    omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism; and
    capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through its
    captive insurance company.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting:

Disclosure
    controls and procedures are designed with the objective of
    ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the
    Company’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act
    of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), such as this
    report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
    the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
    Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed with the
    objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures:

As of the end of the period
    covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and
    procedures as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this
    report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective.

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting:

There were no changes in the Company’s
    internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during
    the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

The Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm on Effectiveness of Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting are incorporated herein by
    reference from Part II, Item 8 of this
