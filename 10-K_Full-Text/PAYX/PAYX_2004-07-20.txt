Item 1.

Business

Paychex, Inc. (the “Company” or
“Paychex”) is a leading, national provider of
comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee
benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized
businesses. Paychex, a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1979
through the consolidation of seventeen corporations engaged in
providing computerized payroll accounting services. As of the
end of fiscal 2004, the Company serviced approximately 505,000
clients and had approximately 9,400 employees. The Company has
its corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and more than
100 offices nationwide. The Company’s fiscal year ends
May 31.

Information about the Company’s products and
services, shareholder information, press releases, and filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can be
found on the Company’s Web site at www.paychex.com. The
Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and
other SEC filings, and any amendments to such reports, are made
available, free of charge, on the Investor Relations section of
this Web site as soon as reasonably practical after such

request submitted to Paychex, Inc., c/o Secretary, 911
Panorama Trail South, Rochester, New York 14625-2396.


Company Strategy

As part of its continuing growth strategy,
Paychex is focused on the following:

During fiscal 2003, Paychex acquired two
comprehensive payroll service providers servicing small- to
medium-sized businesses. Advantage Payroll Services, Inc.
(“Advantage”) was acquired September 20, 2002,
for $314 million in cash, including the redemption of
preferred stock and repayment of outstanding debt of Advantage.
InterPay, Inc. (“InterPay”), a wholly owned subsidiary
of FleetBoston Financial Corporation (“Fleet®”),
was acquired April 1, 2003, for $182 million in cash.
These acquisitions provided Paychex with over 80,000 new clients
and geographic coverage into some areas that were not previously
served by the Company. In addition, the integration of these
companies provides Paychex the opportunity to achieve economies
of scale in providing services to its clients.

During fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, the Company
has been actively integrating Advantage and InterPay into the
operations of Paychex. By the end of fiscal 2003, the sales
forces of these companies were combined with the Paychex sales
force, and the responsibility for their operations and corporate
support had been integrated into the management structure of
Paychex. In addition, by the end of fiscal 2004, most branch
operations were combined into existing Paychex locations. The
Company’s focus has been on client service and retention.
The Advantage payroll system will be retained to service clients
affiliated with the independently owned associate offices and
Advantage co-branded products. Approximately one-half of the
Interpay clients were converted to Paychex software platforms by
the end of fiscal 2004, with the remainder expected to be
converted by December 2004.

In October 2003, Paychex purchased the Time In A
Box® product, a time and attendance solution for small- to
medium-sized businesses, from Stromberg LLC
(“Stromberg”). Effective April 12, 2004, Paychex
acquired substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of
Stromberg, a provider of time and attendance software solutions,
for $13.6 million. These product line acquisitions allow
Paychex to offer value-added products and services to payroll
and non-payroll clients.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Paychex
began a start-up payroll sales and operations facility in
Germany, representing the first expansion of Paychex outside of
the United States. By the end of the fiscal 2004, this location
had acquired a small number of clients.

Market Opportunities

The outsourcing of business processes is a
growing trend within the United States. Outsourcing of the
payroll and human resource functions allows small-to
medium-sized businesses to minimize the compliance risks
associated with increasingly complex and changing administrative
requirements and federal, state, and local tax regulations. By
utilizing the expertise of outsourcing service providers,
businesses are able to reduce processing costs and
administrative burdens while, at the same time, adding
competitive benefits for their


employees. The technical capabilities, knowledge,
and operational expertise that Paychex has built, along with the
broad portfolio of ancillary services it offers its clients,
have enabled the Company to capitalize on this outsourcing trend.

There are approximately 7.5 million
employers in the payroll markets that Paychex currently serves
within the United States. Of those employers, 99% have fewer
than 100 employees and are the Company’s primary customers
and target market. Based on industry data, the Company estimates
that all payroll processors combined serve somewhere between 15%
to 20% of the potential businesses, with much of the
unpenetrated market in businesses with ten or fewer employees.
Paychex remains focused on servicing small- to medium-sized
businesses based upon this growth potential that management
believes exists in this market segment.

Clients

Paychex serves a diverse base of small- to
medium-sized clients operating in a broad range of industries
located throughout the continental United States. At
May 31, 2004, the Company serviced approximately 505,000
clients. The Company utilizes service agreements and
arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the
client at any time or upon relatively short notice.
Paychex’s client losses have historically been slightly
higher than 20% of the beginning client base. The most
significant factor contributing to client losses is companies
going out of business. No single client has a material impact on
total service revenues or results of operations.

The composition of the market and the client base
serviced by the Company (in the United States) by employee size
is as follows:

Products and Services

Paychex offers a comprehensive portfolio of
payroll, payroll-related, and human resource products to meet
the diverse needs of its client base. These include payroll
processing, tax filing and payment, employee payment, time and
attendance solutions, regulatory compliance (new-hire reporting
and garnishment processing), retirement services administration,
employee benefits administration, workers’ compensation
insurance, and comprehensive bundled human resource
administrative services. By offering ancillary services that
leverage the information gathered in the base payroll processing
service, Paychex is able to provide comprehensive outsourcing
services that allow employers to expand their employee benefits
offerings at an affordable cost. The Company earns its revenues
primarily through recurring fees for repetitive services
performed related to these products. Service revenues are
largely driven by the number of clients, utilization of
ancillary services, and checks or transactions per client per
pay period.

Payroll
Processing:

Payroll processing is
the backbone of the Paychex product portfolio. The Paychex
Payroll service includes the calculation, preparation, and
delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
accounting records and management reports; and the preparation
of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns. Payroll
processing clients are charged a base fee each period that
payroll is processed, plus a fee per employee check processed.

The Core Payroll product is generally targeted
for clients with one to forty-nine employees, although many
clients with fifty or more employees utilize this service. The
Company’s average Core Payroll client (including Advantage
and InterPay clients) employs approximately thirteen people and
processes approximately thirty-one payrolls each year. Core
Payroll clients communicate their payroll information, including


hours worked by each employee and any personnel
or compensation changes, usually by telephone or fax, to their
assigned payroll specialist. Upon receiving the information from
the client, the Paychex payroll specialist enters it into the
payroll system. Paychex trains these specialists in all facets
of payroll preparation and applicable tax regulations and
continually updates this training. Clients can also transfer
data from their personal computer by using the Paychex
Paylink® software or via the Internet. Clients receive
payroll checks and reports from either a delivery service, the
United States Postal Service, or by picking them up at the local
Paychex branch.

Paychex also offers Core Payroll services to its
clients and their accountants via Paychex Online. This secure
Internet site offers clients a suite of interactive,
self-service products and services twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week. These include Paychex Online
Payroll

SM

, Internet Time Sheet, Internet Report
Service, and General Ledger Reporting Service. Clients can
communicate payroll information via Internet Time Sheet or use
the Online Payroll service, as well as access current and
historical payroll information using the Paychex Internet Report
Service. The General Ledger Reporting Service transfers payroll
information calculated by Paychex to the client’s general
ledger accounting software, eliminating manual entries and
improving the accuracy of bookkeeping. Over 100,000 clients are
currently utilizing some type of online service.

The Company’s Major Market Services
(MMS) Payroll product primarily targets companies that have
outgrown the Company’s Core Payroll service or new clients
that have fifty or more employees or more complex payroll and
benefits needs. Due to expansion efforts in recent years, the
Company currently offers this product in all of its significant
markets. Approximately one-third of new MMS clients are
conversions from the Company’s Core Payroll product.

Most MMS clients communicate their payroll
information to Paychex using the Company’s Preview®
software. Preview provides clients in-house control of payroll
and human resource information because the software and the
payroll and human resource database reside on the client’s
personal computer or personal computer network. Clients can
produce reports and checks at their convenience. Paychex handles
the software maintenance and provides the client ancillary
services as requested.

Ancillary Products and
Services:

Paychex provides its
clients with a portfolio of ancillary products and services that
have been developed and refined over many years. Ancillary
products provide the Company with additional recurring revenue
streams and increased service efficiencies as these products are
integrated with payroll processing services. Paychex offers the
following ancillary products and services:

Tax Filing and Payment
Services:

As of May 31, 2004,
89% of the Company’s clients utilized its tax filing and
payment services (including Taxpay®), which provide
accurate preparation and timely filing of quarterly and year-end
tax returns, as well as the electronic transfer of funds to the
appropriate agencies (federal, state, and local). More than 90%
of new clients purchase the Company’s tax filing and
payment services. The Company believes that the client
utilization percentage of these services is near maturity. In
connection with these services, the Company electronically
collects payroll taxes from clients’ bank accounts,
typically on payday, files the applicable tax returns, and pays
taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities on the respective
due dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and thirty
days after receipt of collections from clients, with some items
extending to ninety days. The Company handles all regulatory
correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes,
and is subject to cash penalties imposed by tax authorities for
late filings and late or underpayments of taxes. Clients
utilizing the tax filing and payment services are charged a base
fee each period that payroll is processed. In addition to fees
paid by clients, the Company earns interest on client funds that
are collected before due dates and invested until remittance to
the appropriate taxing authority.

Employee Payment
Services:

As of May 31, 2004,
63% of the Company’s clients utilized its employee payment
services, which provide the employer the option of paying their
employees by Direct Deposit, Paychex Access Visa® Card, a
check drawn on a Paychex account (Readychex®), or a check
drawn on the employer’s account. More than 70% of new
clients purchase some form of employee payment services. For the
first three methods, Paychex electronically collects net payroll
from the client’s bank account, typically one day before
payroll, and provides payment to the employee on payday. The
Company offers flexible payment


options that offer the benefit of convenient,
one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers. Clients
utilizing employee payment services are charged a base fee for
each period that payroll is processed and a fee per transaction
or per employee depending on the service provided. In addition
to fees paid by the client, the Company earns interest on client
funds that are collected before pay dates and invested until
remittance to the client’s employees.

The tax filing and payment services and employee
payment services are integrated with the Company’s Payroll
processing service. Interest earned on funds held for clients is
included in total revenues on the Consolidated Statements of
Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these
funds are critical components of providing these services.

Time and Attendance
Solutions:

Paychex offers Time In
A Box and other time and attendance solutions, which help
minimize the time spent compiling time sheet information. These
computer-based systems allow the employer flexibility to handle
multiple payroll scenarios and result in improved productivity,
accuracy, and reliability in the payroll process. Certain
clients are charged a monthly fee for use of hardware, software,
and support. Clients also have the option to purchase the
hardware and software with annual maintenance contracts.

Regulatory Compliance
Services:

Paychex offers New-Hire
Reporting services, which enable clients to comply with federal
and state requirements to report information on newly hired
employees, to aid the government in enforcing child support
orders, and to minimize fraudulent unemployment and
workers’ compensation insurance claims. The Company’s
Garnishment Processing service provides deductions from
employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies,
including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the
obligation to fulfillment. These services enable employers to
comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties.

Comprehensive Administrative
Services:

The Paychex
Administrative Services (PAS) product provides businesses a
full-service approach to the outsourcing of employer and
employee administrative needs. PAS offers businesses a package
of services that includes payroll, employer compliance, human
resource and employee benefits administration, and employee risk
management. This comprehensive bundle of services is designed to
make it easier for businesses to manage their payroll and
benefit costs while providing a benefits package equal to that
of larger companies. The Company also operates a Professional
Employer Organization (PEO), which provides businesses with the
same combined package of services as the PAS product, but with
Paychex acting as a co-employer of the client’s employees.
The Company’s PEO is operated primarily in Florida and
Georgia, where PEOs are more prevalent. Paychex offers its PEO
product through its subsidiary, Paychex Business Solutions, Inc.
For these two products, the client pays a fee per employee per
processing period. As of May 31, 2004, the PAS and PEO
products combined serviced over 157,000 client employees.

Retirement
Services:

The Company’s
Retirement Services product line offers a variety of options to
clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE, SIMPLE IRA,
401(k) plans with Safe Harbor provisions, profit sharing, and
money purchase plans. These services provide plan
implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations,
employee and employer reporting, participant access online,
electronic funds transfer, and other administrative services.
Selling efforts for these products are focused primarily on the
Company’s existing payroll client base, as the processed
payroll information allows for data integration necessary to
provide these services efficiently. Retirement Services products
were utilized by over 29,000 clients at May 31, 2004. This
demonstrates the continuing interest of small- to medium-sized
businesses in providing retirement savings benefits to their
employees. Paychex is now one of the largest 401(k)
recordkeepers for small businesses in the United States. Clients
utilizing this service are charged a monthly fee and a fee per
employee. Client employee 401(k) funds externally managed
totaled approximately $3.9 billion at May 31, 2004.
The Company earns a fee approximating thirty basis points from
the external managers based on the total of client employee
401(k) funds.

Workers’ Compensation
Services:

Most employers are
required to carry workers’ compensation insurance, which
provides payments to employees who are unable to work because of
job-related injuries. Paychex provides Workers’
Compensation Insurance Administration services by serving, via
its licensed insurance agency, as a general agent providing
qualified workers’ compensation insurance through a variety
of insurance


carriers who are underwriters. The
Pay-As-You-Go

SM

program uses rate and job
classification information to enable clients to pay
workers’ compensation premiums in regular monthly amounts
rather than with large up-front payments, which stabilizes their
cash flow and minimizes year-end adjustments. The Workers’
Compensation Report Service provides the client with
comprehensive information to allow it to better manage its
workers’ compensation insurance costs. As of May 31,
2004, approximately 37,000 clients utilized the Workers’
Compensation insurance products.

Section 125
Plans:

The Company offers the
outsourcing of plan administration under section 125 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The Premium Only Plan allows employees to
pay for certain health insurance benefits with pretax dollars,
which can result in a reduction in payroll taxes for employers
and employees. The Flexible Spending Account Plan allows a
client’s employees to pay, with pretax dollars, health and
dependent care expenses not covered by insurance. All required
implementation, administration, compliance, claims processing
and reimbursement, and coverage tests are provided with these
services.

Other Human Resource
Products:

Group health benefits
are offered in select geographic areas, as are state
unemployment insurance services, which provide clients with
prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations,
change statements, and requests for separation documents. Other
Human Resource and Benefits products include employee handbooks,
management manuals, and personnel forms. These products are
designed to simplify clients’ office processes and enhance
their employee benefits programs.

Sales and Marketing

The Company markets its services primarily
through its direct sales force based in major metropolitan
markets serviced by the Company. The Company’s sales
representatives specialize in Core Payroll, Major Market
Services Payroll, or Human Resource and Benefits product lines.
For fiscal 2005, the Company’s sales force is expected to
total approximately 1,625, with 1,045 focused on Core Payroll,
175 focused on Major Market Services Payroll, and 405 focused on
various Human Resource and Benefits products. The Human Resource
and Benefits sales force is comprised of 220 401(k)
recordkeeping sales representatives, 135 PAS/ PEO sales
representatives, and 50 licensed agents selling Workers’
Compensation Insurance services. In addition to its direct
selling and marketing efforts, the Company utilizes
relationships with existing clients, certified public
accountants (CPAs), and banks for new client referrals.
Approximately two-thirds of the Company’s new clients
(excluding acquisitions) come from these referral sources. To
further enhance its strong relationship with CPAs, during fiscal
2004, Paychex partnered with the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA) as the preferred payroll
provider for its AICPA Business Solutions Partner Program. The
sales force for Human Resource and Benefits products is
primarily focused on selling products and services to existing
payroll clients as their processed payroll information provides
the data integration necessary to provide these services.

The Company’s Web site at www.paychex.com,
which includes online payroll sales presentations and product
information, is a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of
leads and new sales while complementing the efforts of the field
sales force. This online tool allows Paychex to market to
clients in more geographically remote areas. The Company’s
sales representatives are also supported by marketing,
advertising, public relations, trade shows, and telemarketing
programs. The Company has grown and expects to continue to grow
its direct sales force. In recent years, the Company has
increased its emphasis on the selling of ancillary services to
both new clients and its existing client base.

The acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay
provided Paychex with additional sales channels. Paychex,
through its acquisition of Advantage, has license agreements
with fifteen independently owned associate offices, which are
responsible for selling and marketing payroll services and
performing certain operational functions, while Paychex provides
all centralized back-office payroll processing and tax filing
services. In addition, as a result of the Advantage acquisition,
Paychex has a relationship with NEBS® (“New England
Business Service, Inc.”) whereby Paychex performs all
client functions other than sales and marketing. As part of the
InterPay acquisition, Fleet entered into a referral relationship
with Paychex.


Competition

The market for payroll processing and human
resource services is highly competitive and fragmented. The
Company believes its primary national competitor, ADP®
(“Automatic Data Processing”), is the largest
U.S. third-party provider of payroll processing and human
resource services in terms of revenue. Paychex competes with
other national, regional, local, and online service providers,
all of which have significantly smaller client bases.

In addition to traditional payroll processing and
human resource service providers, the Company competes with
in-house payroll and human resource systems and departments.
Payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many
vendors. The Company’s Human Resource and Benefits products
also compete with a variety of providers of unbundled human
resource services, such as retirement services companies,
insurance companies, and human resources and benefits consulting
firms.

Competition in the payroll processing and human
resource services industry is primarily based on service
responsiveness, product quality and reputation, breadth of
product offering, and price. Paychex believes it is competitive
in each of these areas.

Software Maintenance and Product
Development

The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and
local taxing authorities require Paychex to update the
proprietary software utilized by the Company to provide Payroll
and Human Resource and Benefits services to its clients. The
Company is continually engaged in developing enhancements and
maintenance to its various software platforms to meet the
changing requirements of its clients and the marketplace.
Research and development expenses are not significant to the
Company’s overall results of operations.

Employees

As of May 31, 2004, the Company employed
approximately 9,400 people. None of the employees are covered by
collective bargaining agreements.

Intellectual Property

The Company owns or licenses and uses a number of
trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade
secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual
property rights. Taken as a whole, the Company’s
intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of the
Company’s business. Where it is determined to be
appropriate, the Company takes measures to protect its
intellectual property rights, including by way of example,
through confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies
with employees, vendors and others, use of license agreements
with licensees and licensors of intellectual property, and
registration of certain trademarks. Paychex believes that the
“Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material
importance to the Company.

Seasonality

There is no significant seasonality to the
Company’s business. However, during the Company’s
third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new
Payroll clients, Retirement Services clients, and new PAS and
PEO worksite employees tends to be higher than in the rest of
the fiscal year, primarily because a majority of new clients
start using services in the beginning of a calendar year. In
addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client
funds activity are traditionally higher during the third fiscal
quarter due to clients paying year-end bonuses and requesting
additional year-end services. Historically, as a result of these
factors, the Company’s total revenue has been slightly
higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, with greater
sales commission expenses also reported in these quarters.

Risk Factors

The Company’s future results of operations
are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks
and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ
materially from historical and current results and from


Company projections. Important factors known to
us that could cause such differences include, but are not
limited to, those discussed below and those contained in the
“Safe Harbor” statement at the beginning of this
Form 10-K.

The Company may make errors and omissions
in providing services:

Processing,
tracking, collecting, and remitting client funds to the various
taxing authorities, client employees, and other third parties
are complex operations. Errors have occurred in the past and are
likely to occur in the future. These errors could include, but
are not limited to, late filing with tax agencies, underpayment
of taxes, and failure to comply with applicable banking
regulations and laws relating to employee benefits
administration, which could result in significant penalties and
liabilities that would adversely affect the Company’s
results of operations. The Company could also transfer funds in
error to an incorrect party or for the wrong amount, and may be
unable to correct the error or recover the funds, resulting in a
loss to the Company.

Changes in government regulations and
policies could adversely impact the
business:

Many of the
Company’s services, particularly tax filing and payment
services and benefit plan administration services, are designed
according to government regulations that continue to change.
Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of
benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide
employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and
employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or
eliminate the need for some of the Company’s services and
substantially decrease its revenue. Added requirements could
also increase the cost of doing business. Failure by the Company
to modify its services in a timely fashion in response to
regulatory changes could have adverse effects on the
Company’s results of operations.

Failure of third-party service providers to
perform their functions could harm the
business:

As part of providing
services to clients, Paychex relies on a number of third-party
service providers. These providers include, but are not limited
to, couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks,
which electronically transfer funds from clients to their
employees. Failure by these providers, for any reason, to
deliver their services in a timely manner could result in
material interruptions to Company operations, impact client
relations, and result in significant penalties or liabilities to
the Company.

Failure of the Company’s Business
Continuity Plan in the event of a catastrophe could result in
the loss of client data and adversely interrupt
operations:

The Company’s
operations are dependent on its ability to protect its
infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural
disaster, security breach, power loss, telecommunications
failure, terrorist attack, or similar event. The Company has a
Business Continuity Plan in place in the event of system failure
due to any of these events. If the Business Continuity Plan was
unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, the Company could
potentially lose client data or experience material adverse
interruptions to its operations.

Integration of
acquisitions:

The effective
integration of acquired companies may be difficult to achieve.
It is also possible that the Company may not realize any or all
expected benefits from recent acquisitions or achieve benefits
from acquisitions in a timely manner. In addition, the Company
may incur significant costs and impact existing internal
resources in connection with the integration of acquisitions.
Failure to effectively integrate recent and future acquisitions
could affect the Company’s results of operations.

Legal
matters:

The Company is subject to
various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course
of business. These include disputes related to breach of
contract, employment-related claims, intellectual property
infringement, and other matters. In light of the legal reserve
recorded, the Company’s management currently believes that
resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position or results of
operations. However, these matters are subject to inherent
uncertainties and there exists the possibility that their
ultimate resolution could have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s financial position and results of operations in
the period in which any such effect is recorded.


Any of the above risk factors could cause damage
to the Company’s business reputation, which is important to
the Company’s ability to attract new clients and retain
existing clients. Other risk factors include the following:

Paychex clients could have insufficient
funds to cover payments the Company has made on their behalf to
taxing authorities and employees:

As part of the payroll processing service, Paychex is authorized
by its clients to transfer money from their bank accounts to
fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing
authorities. It is possible that the Company would be held
liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient
funds to cover them. The Company has in the past, and may in the
future, make payments on its clients’ behalf for which it
is not reimbursed, resulting in a loss to the Company.

Interest earned on funds held for clients
could be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating
the amount of tax withheld or timing of
remittance:

The Company receives
interest income from investing client funds collected but not
yet remitted to taxing authorities or to client employees. A
change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to
be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government
authorities would adversely impact this interest income.

Stock price
volatility:

The market price of
the Company’s common stock may be influenced by factors
such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements
of new services or technological innovations by the Company or
its competitors, market conditions in the business process
outsourcing industry, changes in ratings or financial estimates
by securities analysts, general economic conditions,
fluctuations in the stock market that are not directly related
to the Company’s operating performance, and other factors
and events that are beyond the Company’s control. These and
other factors can lead to fluctuations in the price of the
Company’s stock.

Properties

The Company’s headquarters are located at
911 Panorama Trail South, Rochester, New York 14625 in a
140,000-square-foot building complex owned by the Company. In
addition, within the Rochester area, the Company owns four
facilities, which account for a combined total of
435,000 square feet, and leases approximately
67,000 square feet in two office complexes. These
facilities house various administrative and technology
functions, certain ancillary service functions, and a
telemarketing unit.

In addition, outside of Rochester, New York, the
Company leases approximately 1,768,000 square feet of space
for its regional, branch, and sales offices, and data processing
centers at various locations throughout the United States,
concentrating on major metropolitan areas. The Company owns
branch facilities located in Syracuse, New York; Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania; Auburn, Maine; and Rock Hill, South Carolina,
which together account for approximately 105,000 square
feet. The Company leases approximately 3,500 square feet of
space for an office in Germany. The Company believes that
adequate, suitable lease space will continue to be available for
its needs.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to various claims and
legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. These
include disputes related to breach of contract,
employment-related claims, intellectual property infringement,
and other matters.

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary,
Rapid Payroll, Inc., are defendants in twenty-two lawsuits
pending in Los Angeles Superior Court and the United States
District Court for the Central District of California brought by
licensees of payroll processing software owned by Rapid Payroll.
In August of 2001, Rapid Payroll informed seventy-six licensees
that it intended to stop supporting the software in August of
2002. Thereafter, thirty lawsuits were commenced by licensees
asserting various claims, including breach of contract and
related tort and fraud causes of action. These lawsuits seek
compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief
against Rapid Payroll, the Company, its Chief Executive Officer,
and its Senior


Vice President of Sales and Marketing. In
accordance with the Company’s indemnification agreements
with its senior executives, the Company will defend and, if
necessary, indemnify the individual defendants as they relate to
these pending matters. On July 5, 2002, the federal court
entered a preliminary injunction requiring that Rapid Payroll
and the Company continue to support and maintain the subject
software pursuant to the license agreements. The Company has
reached resolutions with certain licensees, resulting in the
dismissal of eight lawsuits, which included payments totaling
approximately $1.6 million. The Company, Rapid Payroll, and
the individual defendants are vigorously defending the remaining
twenty-two actions, which are in various stages. Among other
defenses, Rapid Payroll asserts that its liability is limited,
by express contractual provisions, to the amount of fees paid
under the license agreements. The Company and other defendants
have been granted several motions for summary judgment
dismissing various claims, and other such motions are pending or
anticipated upon completion of discovery.

On June 18, 2004, a Superior Court jury
found that Rapid Payroll had breached its license agreement with
Payroll Partnership, L.P. and two related entities. The jury
awarded approximately $6.4 million in compensatory damages
against Rapid Payroll, which plans to file post-trial motions
and, if necessary, to appeal. The Superior Court dismissed other
claims against Rapid Payroll, the Company, and the individual
defendants, including fraud and tort causes of action. The six
remaining state court cases are to be tried one after the other
in Superior Court, beginning with a jury trial currently
scheduled to begin on August 23, 2004. Discovery and
motions are continuing in the federal court cases, with the
first trial currently scheduled to start in January 2005.

Based on the application of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies,” the Company is
required to record a reserve if it believes an unfavorable
outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be
reasonably estimated. During the third and fourth quarters of
fiscal 2004, the Company recorded $9.2 million and
$26.6 million, respectively, in expense to increase the
reserve for the estimated costs associated with the resolution
of pending legal matters. The legal reserve totaled
$35.0 million and $1.1 million at May 31, 2004
and May 31, 2003, respectively, and is included in other
current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This
reserve may change in the future due to new developments or
changes in the Company’s strategies.

In light of the legal reserve recorded, the
Company’s management currently believes that resolution of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.
However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of
these matters could have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s financial position and the results of operations
in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations reviews the
Company’s operating results for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended May 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004, 2003,
and 2002), and its financial condition at May 31, 2004.
This review should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of
this Form 10-K and risk factors discussed in Item 1 of
this Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements in this review
are qualified by the cautionary statement under the heading
“Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 contained at the beginning of this
Form 10-K.

Overview

Paychex is a leading, national provider of
comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee
benefits outsourcing solutions for small-to medium-sized
businesses. The Company has a broad portfolio of products and
services that allows its clients to meet their diverse payroll
and human resource needs. These include payroll processing, tax
filing and payment, employee payment, time and attendance
systems, regulatory compliance (new-hire reporting and
garnishment processing), retirement services administration,
employee benefits administration, workers’ compensation
insurance, and comprehensive bundled human resource
administrative services. The Company’s strategy is focused
on growing its client base, increasing utilization of ancillary
services, and leveraging its technological and operating
infrastructure. The Company earns its revenues primarily through
recurring fees for repetitive services performed related to
these products. Service revenues are largely driven by the
number of clients, utilization of ancillary services, and


checks or transactions per client per pay period.
The Company also earns interest on funds held for clients
between the time of collection from clients and remittance to
the respective tax agencies or client employees.

In fiscal 2004, the Company completed its
fourteenth consecutive year of record total revenues, net
income, and diluted earnings per share. For fiscal 2004, total
revenues grew 18% year-over-year to $1,294.3 million. This
in turn generated net income of $303.0 million, or $.80
diluted earnings per share. In comparison, revenues for fiscal
2003 increased 15% year-over-year to $1,099.1 million. Net
income in fiscal 2003 was $293.5 million, or $.78 diluted
earnings per share. Year-over-year growth in net income was 3%
and 7% for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. Operating
income increased 8% year-over-year in fiscal 2004 to
$433.3 million, compared with a year-over-year increase in
fiscal 2003 of 10% to $401.0 million.

During fiscal 2004, the Company’s results of
operations were impacted by expense charges to increase the
reserve for pending legal matters of Rapid Payroll, Inc. (a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company). These charges totaled
$35.8 million, reflecting $9.2 million recorded in the
third quarter and $26.6 million recorded in the fourth
quarter. The expense charges reduced diluted earnings per share
for fiscal 2004 by approximately $.06 per share.

The fiscal 2004 results of operations were also
impacted by approximately $6.4 million of net incremental
PEO revenue resulting from a refund of PEO workers’
compensation insurance premiums and a reduction of the estimated
claims loss exposure under the fiscal 2003 insurance policy,
which was recorded in the third quarter.

The Company’s results of operations for
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were also impacted by the
acquisitions in fiscal 2003 of two payroll service providers
servicing small- to medium-sized businesses in the United
States. On September 20, 2002, Paychex acquired Advantage
Payroll Services, Inc. (“Advantage”) for
$314 million in cash. On April 1, 2003, Paychex
acquired InterPay, Inc. (“InterPay”) for
$182 million in cash. These two acquisitions provided
Paychex with over 80,000 new clients. The Company’s results
of operations for fiscal 2004 include the results of Advantage
and InterPay for the entire period. The results of operations
for fiscal 2003 include the results of Advantage and InterPay
from the respective dates of acquisition. In April 2004, the
Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain
liabilities of Stromberg LLC (“Stromberg”), a provider
of time and attendance software solutions, for
$13.6 million. The Company paid $12.6 million in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and an additional
$1.0 million is expected to be paid in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2005. The Stromberg acquisition did not have a
material impact on the results of operations of the Company for
fiscal 2004. For additional information related to these
acquisitions refer to Note B in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this
Form 10-K.

During fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2004,
the Company, and the industry as a whole, experienced lower
growth rates as a result of challenging economic conditions and
the effect of lower interest rates. The downturn in the economy
impacted payroll service revenues as a result of lower checks
per client as existing clients reduced their work forces. Checks
per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) decreased 3.0% and
..5% year-over-year in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, respectively.
For fiscal 2004, checks per client (excluding Advantage and
InterPay) were relatively comparable with the prior year period.

In response to economic conditions, the Federal
Reserve lowered the Federal Funds rate thirteen times from
January 2001 through May 31, 2004 to 1.00%, for a
cumulative 550-basis-point reduction. Lower interest rates have
adversely impacted income earned on the Company’s funds
held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. During the
last three fiscal years, the Company was able to offset some of
the impact of lower interest rates by realizing gains from the
sale of available-for-sale investments in both the client funds
and corporate investment portfolios.

Due to the impact of fluctuations in interest
rates earned on funds held for clients and corporate
investments, the Company also focuses on operating income
excluding interest on funds held for clients in evaluating the
results of operations. Operating income excluding interest on
funds held for clients experienced year-over-year growth of 9%
in fiscal 2004 and 16% in fiscal 2003, increasing to
$379.1 million and $347.9 million, respectively.
Operating income was also impacted by the $35.8 million of
expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal
matters and the $6.4 million of net incremental PEO
revenue. Operating


income excluding interest on funds held for
clients and these two unusual items was $408.5 million in
fiscal 2004, an increase of 17% year-over-year.

Paychex continues to make investments in the
business as part of its growth strategy. Some of these
investments include the following:

Growing the client base and increasing
utilization of ancillary services:

In fiscal 2004, the Company reached a milestone as its client
base increased to approximately 505,000 clients at May 31,
2004. This compares with approximately 490,000 clients at
May 31, 2003, and over 390,000 clients at May 31,
2002. The acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003
accounted for over 80,000 clients. Year-over-year client growth
was approximately 3% for fiscal 2004. Client growth excluding
the impact of the acquisitions was approximately 7% for fiscal
2004 and slightly less than 5% for fiscal 2003.

Paychex has continued to invest in its direct
sales force, as the Company believes there is opportunity for
growth within the target market of small- to medium-sized
businesses. The approximate composition of the Company’s
direct sales force is summarized in the following table:

The Company believes there are opportunities for
growth within the current client base, as well as with new
clients, through increased utilization of the Company’s
payroll-related and human resource ancillary services. Ancillary
services effectively leverage the payroll processing data and,
therefore, are beneficial to the Company’s operating
margin. Penetration of the Company’s tax filing and payment
services and employee payment services has continued to
increase, and totals 89% and 63%, respectively, at May 31,
2004. Client bases in the human resource and employee benefits
areas have continued to grow, as shown in the following table:

Effective integration of acquired
businesses:

During fiscal 2003 and
fiscal 2004, the Company has been integrating Advantage and
InterPay into the operations of Paychex. These integration
efforts will lead to efficiencies in operations and services
provided to clients. By the end of fiscal 2003, the sales forces
of these companies were combined with the Paychex sales force,
and the responsibility for their operations and corporate
support had been integrated into the management structure of
Paychex. By the end of fiscal 2004, most branch operations had
been integrated into existing Paychex locations. The
Company’s primary integration focus continues to be on
client service and retention. The Advantage payroll system is
being retained for the foreseeable future in order to service
clients affiliated with independently owned associate offices
and Advantage co-branded products. Approximately one-half of the
InterPay clients were converted to Paychex software platforms by
the end of May 2004, with the remaining clients expected to be
converted by December 2004.

Focus on customer
service:

The Company has always
focused on customer service and minimizing client losses, and in
fiscal 2004, client satisfaction survey results improved over
fiscal 2003. Client losses, which are slightly higher than 20%
of the beginning client base, are near historical lows. The most
significant factor contributing to client losses is companies
going out of business. In addition, Paychex has invested in
efforts to reduce turnover of payroll specialists, who are the
primary contact with the clients, through improvements in


work processes, technology, and compensation.
These efforts have resulted in an improvement in retention of
payroll specialists.

Other
initiatives:

Other initiatives
during fiscal 2004 include the following:

•

Paychex expanded its product line to include time
    and attendance solutions products.

•

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Paychex
    began operating a start-up payroll sales and operations facility
    in Germany. This represents the first expansion of Paychex
    outside of the United States.

•

Paychex expanded its network of offices within
    the United States by opening four new offices in mid-tier
    markets. The Company anticipates opening additional offices in
    similar-sized markets in fiscal 2005.

None of these initiatives, either individually or
in the aggregate, had a material impact on the Company’s
results of operations.

In fiscal 2003, the Company placed into service a
$30 million consolidated data center in Rochester, New
York. This data center was designed to enhance data processing
and disaster recovery capabilities.

At May 31, 2004, the Company maintains a
strong financial position with total cash and corporate
investments of $523.8 million. The Company’s primary
source of cash is its ongoing operations. Cash flow from
operations was $390.1 million in fiscal 2004 and
$373.7 million in fiscal 2003, year-over-year increases of
4% and 23%, respectively. Historically, the Company has funded
its operations, capital purchases, purchases of corporate
investments, and dividend payments from its operating
activities. The acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal
2003 and Stromberg in fiscal 2004, were funded from the
Company’s cash and corporate investments. It is anticipated
that current cash and corporate investment balances, along with
projected operating cash flows, will support normal business
operations, capital purchases, and current dividend payments for
the foreseeable future.

For further analysis of the Company’s
results of operations for fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, and
financial position at May 31, 2004, refer to the discussion
of “Critical Accounting Policies” and the charts and
analysis in the “Results of Operations” and
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections of this
review.

Critical Accounting Policies

Note A to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K,
discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex, Inc.
The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial
condition and results of operations are based upon its
Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
policies. The preparation of these financial statements requires
the Company’s management to make estimates, judgments, and
assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company
evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare
the Consolidated Financial Statements, including, but not
limited to, those related to revenue recognition, PEO
workers’ compensation insurance, investments, goodwill and
intangible assets, fixed assets, potential losses resulting from
its clients’ inability to meet their payroll obligations,
contingencies, allowance for doubtful accounts, and income
taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience,
future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable
under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and
results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting
policies that are deemed critical to the Company’s results
of operations or financial position are discussed below.

Revenue
recognition:

Service revenues are
recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Certain processing services are provided under annual service
arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
service period. The Company’s service revenues are largely
attributable to payroll-related processing services where the
fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed
amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or
transaction processed. Paychex provides delivery service for the
distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports. The
revenue earned from delivery


service is included in service revenues, and the
costs for delivery are included in operating costs on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Professional Employer Organization
(PEO) revenues are included in service revenues and are
reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include
wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite
employees. Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite
employees were $1,846.1 million, $1,460.7 million, and
$1,056.9 million for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned
primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due
dates, for payroll tax filing and payment services and employee
payment services, and invested (funds held for clients) until
remittance to the applicable tax agencies or client employees.
These collections from clients are typically remitted between
one and thirty days after receipt, with some items extending to
ninety days. The interest earned on these funds is included in
total revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income because
the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are
critical components of providing these services. Interest on
funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and
losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities.

PEO workers’ compensation
insurance:

In fiscal 2003,
workers’ compensation insurance for PEO worksite employees
was provided under a pre-funded, deductible workers’
compensation policy with a national insurance company. Under
this policy, the Company’s maximum individual claims
liability was $250,000 and the aggregate claims exposure was
based on a percentage of premium rates as applied to
workers’ compensation payroll.

Based on claims experience, during the third
quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded approximately
$6.4 million of net incremental PEO revenue resulting from
a refund of insurance premiums and a reduction in estimated
claims loss exposure under the fiscal 2003 policy. The fiscal
2004 policy is similar to the fiscal 2003 policy, except that
the Company’s maximum individual claims liability is
$500,000. At May 31, 2004, the Company has recorded
$1.8 million in current liabilities for workers’
compensation claims cost based on the estimated loss exposure
under the fiscal 2003 policy, and an estimated prepayment of
$5.0 million under the fiscal 2004 policy in prepaid
expenses and other current assets. These estimates may change in
the future based on claims experience trends.

Valuation of
investments:

The Company’s
investments in debt securities are reported at fair value.
Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of
investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the
fair value are included in comprehensive income as reported on
the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact
the Company’s net income only when such investments are
sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on
the sale of securities are determined by specific identification
of the security’s cost basis. On the Consolidated
Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held
for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients,
whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are
included in investment income, net.

The Company is exposed to credit risk in
connection with these investments through the possible inability
of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. The Company
attempts to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in
high-credit-quality securities. The Company periodically reviews
its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or
other potential valuation concerns, which would require the
Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such
determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company
evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which
the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the
credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the
investment, and its ability and intent to hold the investment
until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. The
Company’s assessment that an investment is not
other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due
to new developments or changes in the Company’s strategies
or assumptions related to any particular investment.

Goodwill and intangible
assets:

For business combinations,
Paychex assigns estimated fair values to all assets and
liabilities acquired, including intangible assets such as
customer lists, certain license agreements,


trade names, and non-compete agreements. The
assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and
the determination of useful lives for depreciable and
amortizable assets requires significant estimates, judgments,
and assumptions. For certain fixed assets, including software,
and intangible assets, the Company utilizes the assistance of
independent valuation consultants. The remaining purchase price
of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and
liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

The Company has $405.7 million of goodwill
recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at May 31, 2004,
resulting from acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” requires that goodwill not be amortized, but
instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim
periods if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to
indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair
value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by
comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its
carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company performs its
annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. The
Company’s business is largely homogeneous and, as a result,
substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one
reporting unit. Based on the results of the Company’s
goodwill impairment review, no impairment charge was recognized.
Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or
circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the
goodwill balance.

The Company also tests intangible assets for
potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Fixed assets:

The carrying value of fixed assets, including costs for acquired
software and software developed for internal use, reflects
estimates, assumptions, and judgments relative to capitalized
costs, useful lives, utilization, and salvage value. For
software developed for internal use, all external direct costs
for materials and services and certain payroll and related
fringe costs are capitalized in accordance with Statement of
Position (SOP) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.”
The Company reviews the carrying value of fixed assets for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.

Accrual for client fund
losses:

The Company maintains an
accrual for estimated losses associated with its clients’
inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of
providing payroll, tax filing and payment services, and employee
payment services, Paychex is authorized by the client to
initiate money transfers from the client’s account for the
amount of tax obligations and employees’ direct deposits.
Electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are
subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients’
insufficient funds to cover such transfers. The Company
evaluates certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and
analyzes historical experience for amounts not specifically
reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the
clients.

Contingent
liabilities:

The Company is
subject to various claims and legal matters. During the third
and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded
$9.2 million and $26.6 million, respectively, in
expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal
matters. At May 31, 2004, the Company has recorded
approximately $35.0 million in the reserve for pending
legal matters based on the application of SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies,” which requires the
Company to record a reserve if it believes an unfavorable
outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be
reasonably estimated. The determination of whether any
particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a
probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable
judgment. This reserve may change in the future due to new
developments or changes in the Company’s strategies or
assumptions related to any particular matter. In light of the
legal reserve recorded, the Company’s management currently
believes that resolution of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position
or results of operations. However, these matters are subject to
inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the
ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material
adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and the
results of operations in the period in which any such effect is

Results of Operations

Summary of Results of Operations for the
Fiscal Years Ended May 31:


Details regarding the Company’s combined
funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are
as follows:

Revenues:

Total service revenues are comprised of revenues from the
Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines. Payroll
service revenues are earned primarily from payroll processing,
tax filing and payment services, employee payment services, and
other ancillary services. Human Resource and Benefits service
revenues are earned primarily from Retirement Services,
Workers’ Compensation Insurance Administration,
Section 125 Plan Administration, and Paychex Administrative
Services and Professional Employer Organization bundled
services. The company estimates that year-over-year organic
service revenue growth was approximately 13% for fiscal 2004 and
approximately 11% for fiscal 2003.

The increase in Payroll service revenues in
fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is due to the acquisitions
of Advantage and InterPay, organic client base growth, increased
utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. The
increase in Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2003 compared
with fiscal 2002 is attributable to the same factors.

As of May 31, 2004, 89% of all clients
utilized the Company’s tax filing and payment services,
compared with 87% at May 31, 2003, and 85% at May 31,
2002. The Company believes the client utilization percentage of
the tax filing and payment services is near maturity. The
Company’s employee payment services were utilized by 63% of
its clients at May 31, 2004, compared with 60% at
May 31, 2003, and 57% at May 31, 2002. More than 90%
of new clients purchase the Company’s tax filing and
payment services and more than 70% of new clients purchase
employee payment services. Major Market Services revenues
totaled $139.7 million,


$101.7 million, and $71.7 million for
fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. This represents
year-over-year revenue growth of 37% for fiscal 2004 and 42% for
fiscal 2003. Approximately one-third of new Major Market
Services clients are conversions from the Company’s Core
Payroll service.

The increases in Human Resource and Benefits
service revenues in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 are primarily
related to increases in the number of clients utilizing
Retirement Services products and increases in Paychex
Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer
Organization (PEO) client employees serviced. Fiscal 2004
also benefited from improving net PEO workers’ compensation
revenue under the fiscal 2004 insurance policy and higher
workers’ compensation Pay-As-You-Go

SM

revenue.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded
approximately $6.4 million of net incremental PEO revenue
resulting from a refund of PEO workers’ compensation
insurance premiums and a reduction of the estimated claims loss
exposure under the fiscal 2003 insurance policy. Excluding this
item, Human Resource and Benefits service revenues increased 29%
for fiscal 2004. Human Resource and Benefits service revenues
excluding total PEO revenue increased 24% in fiscal 2004.
Retirement Services revenues totaled $79.0 million,
$66.7 million, and $56.5 million in fiscal 2004, 2003,
and 2002, respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue
growth of 18% for both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. The Company
serviced over 29,000 and over 26,000 Retirement Services clients
at May 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The PAS product is a combined package of payroll,
employer compliance, employee benefit administration, and risk
management outsourcing services designed to make it easier for
businesses to manage their payroll and benefit costs. The
Company’s PEO product provides primarily the same bundled
services as the PAS product, but with Paychex acting as a
co-employer of the client’s employees. The PEO service is
available primarily in the states of Florida and Georgia, where
PEOs are more prevalent. Sales of the PAS and PEO products have
been strong, with administrative fee revenues from these
products increasing 34% and 40% for fiscal 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The PAS and PEO products serviced over 157,000 and
over 103,000 client employees as of May 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The increase in interest on funds held for
clients in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is the result
of higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale
securities and higher average portfolio balances, offset by
lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2004. In fiscal
2003, interest on funds held for clients declined when compared
to fiscal 2002 due to lower average interest rates earned and a
decrease in net realized gains, offset somewhat by higher
average portfolio balances. The higher average portfolio
balances in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were driven by the
acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 and from
organic client base growth.

Expenses:

The
following table summarizes total consolidated operating,
selling, general, and administrative expenses:

The increases in most expense categories in
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were due in part to the acquisitions
of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003. This includes the
additional investment the Company made in its direct sales force
in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003, as it
integrated the sales forces of Advantage and InterPay. The
remaining increases are primarily due to investments in
personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support
the organic growth of the Company. At May 31, 2004, the
Company had


approximately 9,400 employees compared with
approximately 8,850 at May 31, 2003, and 7,400 at
May 31, 2002.

Depreciation expense is primarily related to
buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment,
and software. In addition to the impact from the acquisitions,
depreciation expense in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was higher
due in part to the purchase of a 220,000-square-foot facility in
Rochester, New York, and the placement of a $30 million
consolidated data center into service, both of which occurred
during the first half of fiscal 2003. Amortization of intangible
assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from the
acquisitions. Other expenses include items such as delivery,
forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment,
professional services, and other costs incurred to support the
business. Fiscal 2004’s expense growth was also impacted by
higher legal and professional service fees. During fiscal 2004,
the Company recorded approximately $35.8 million in expense
charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters.
Excluding this amount, consolidated expenses grew 18% in fiscal
2004.

Operating
Income:

As a result of the above
factors, operating income increased 8% and 10% in fiscal 2004
and fiscal 2003 to $433.3 million and $401.0 million,
respectively.

Investment
Income:

Investment income, net
primarily represents earnings from the Company’s cash and
cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale
investment securities. Investment income does not include
interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total
revenues. The decrease in investment income in fiscal 2004
compared with fiscal 2003 is mainly due to a decrease in average
daily invested balances, lower average interest rates earned,
and lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale
investments. The decrease in investment income in fiscal 2003
compared with fiscal 2002 is mainly due to a decrease in average
daily invested balances and lower average interest rates earned,
offset by higher net realized gains on the sale of
available-for-sale securities. The decrease in average daily
invested balances in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, and higher net
realized gains in fiscal 2003, are primarily the result of the
sale of corporate investments to fund the Advantage and InterPay
acquisitions in fiscal 2003. The Company estimates that
year-over-year reductions in investment income due to the use of
corporate investments to fund the two acquisitions in fiscal
2003 were approximately $7.4 million and $7.6 million,
respectively, in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.

Income Taxes:

The effective income tax rate was 32.6% in fiscal 2004, compared
with 32.0% in fiscal 2003 and 30.5% in fiscal 2002. The
increases in the effective income tax rate are primarily the
result of lower levels of tax-exempt income, which is derived
primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for
clients and corporate investment portfolios. Fiscal 2005’s
effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 33.0%. See
Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for additional
disclosures on income taxes.

Outlook

The Company’s current outlook for the full
fiscal year 2005 is summarized as follows:


•

Growth in operating income excluding interest on
    funds held for clients, the expense charges for pending legal
    matters, and the net incremental PEO revenue, is expected to be
    in excess of 15%.

These projections are based on current economic
and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant
changes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At May 31, 2004, the Company’s
principal source of liquidity was $523.8 million of cash
and corporate investment balances. Current cash and corporate
investments and projected operating cash flows are expected to
support normal business operations, purchases of property and
equipment, and current dividend payments for the foreseeable
future.

Commitments and Contractual
Obligations

The Company has unused borrowing capacity
available under three uncommitted, short-term lines of credit
with financial institutions at market rates of interest as
follows:

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be
to meet short-term funding requirements related to client fund
deposit obligations or to fund normal business operations, if
necessary. The secured line of credit is collateralized
primarily by securities in the Company’s investment
portfolios. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of
credit during fiscal 2004 or at May 31, 2004. The Company
intends to renew the short-term line of credit, which expires at
the end of July 2004.

At May 31, 2004, the Company had letters of
credit outstanding totaling $8.4 million, required to
secure commitments for certain insurance policies. These letters
of credit expire at various dates between December 2004 and
December 2005. In June 2004, the Company entered into a
$24.5 million letter of credit arrangement to secure a
commitment for an insurance policy. The letters of credit are
secured by securities held in the Company’s investment
portfolios.

At May 31, 2004, the Company had recorded
$1.0 million in other current liabilities for the
additional purchase price expected to be paid for the Stromberg
acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

The Company has entered into various operating
leases and purchase obligations that, under U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, are not reflected on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2004. The table
below summarizes the Company’s estimated annual payment
obligations under these commitments, as well as other
contractual obligations shown as other long-term liabilities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2004:

(1)

The Company’s operating leases are primarily
    for office space and equipment used by its operations throughout
    the United States. These amounts do not include future payments
    under redundant leases related to the acquisitions of Advantage
    and InterPay, which are included in the table above with other
    long-term liabilities.


(2)

Purchase obligations include the Company’s
    estimate of the minimum outstanding commitments under purchase
    orders to buy goods and services and legally binding contractual
    arrangements with future payment obligations. Included in the
    total purchase obligations is $5.4 million of commitments
    to purchase capital assets. Amounts actually paid under some of
    these arrangements may be higher due to variable components of
    these agreements.

(3)

The obligations shown as other long-term
    liabilities are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
    May 31, 2004, with $1.4 million in other current
    liabilities and $3.2 million in other long-term
    liabilities. Certain deferred compensation plan obligations and
    other long-term liabilities amounting to $10.7 million are
    excluded because the timing of actual payments cannot be
    specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in
    assumptions required to project the timing of future payments.

Paychex, through its acquisition of Advantage,
has license agreements with fifteen independently owned
associate offices, which are responsible for selling and
marketing the Company’s payroll services and performing
certain operational functions, while Paychex provides all
centralized back-office payroll processing and tax filing
services. In addition, the Company has a relationship with NEBS
(“New England Business Service, Inc.”) whereby Paychex
performs all client functions other than sales and marketing.
Under these arrangements, Paychex pays the Associates and NEBS
commissions based on processing activity for the related
clients. Since the actual amounts of future payments is
uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included
in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates and
NEBS in fiscal 2004 was $14.4 million.

In the normal course of business, the Company
makes representations and warranties that guarantee the
performance of the Company’s services under service
arrangements with clients. The Company has entered into
indemnification agreements with its Officers and Directors,
which require the Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify
these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as
they relate to their services to Paychex and its subsidiaries.
Historically, there have been no material losses related to such
guarantees and indemnifications.

Paychex currently self-insures the deductible
portion of various insured exposures under certain employee
benefit plans. The Company’s estimated loss exposure under
these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current
liabilities. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been
material.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As part of its ongoing business, Paychex does not
participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as
special purpose entities or structured finance entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

Operating Cash Flow Activities

The increase in operating cash flows in fiscal
2004 reflects higher net income adjusted for non-cash items,
offset by cash used by working capital. The increase in
operating cash flows in fiscal 2003 is due to higher net income
adjusted for non-cash items and cash provided by working
capital. The increases in non-cash adjustments to net income are
primarily related to higher depreciation and amortization on
fixed and intangible assets. In fiscal 2004, non-cash
adjustments to net income were also impacted by
$35.8 million in expense charges to increase the reserve
for pending legal matters. The fluctuations in working capital
between


periods were primarily related to the timing of
accounts receivable billing and collection, and timing of
payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other
liabilities.

Investing Cash Flow Activities

Funds held for clients and corporate
investments:

Funds held for
clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and
available-for-sale debt securities. Corporate investments are
primarily comprised of available-for-sale debt securities. The
portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is
detailed in Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The amount of funds held for clients will vary
based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the
related remittance of funds to tax authorities for tax filing
and payment services and employees of clients utilizing employee
payment services. Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and
corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of
purchases, sales, or maturities of corporate investments. During
fiscal 2003, corporate investments were sold to fund the
acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay. Additional discussion of
interest rates and related risks is included in Item 7A of
this Form 10-K.

Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash
acquired:

In fiscal 2004, the
Company paid approximately $12.6 million in cash for the
acquisition of Stromberg and $.6 million of additional
purchase price related to the InterPay acquisition. In fiscal
2003, the company paid $314.4 million in cash for the
acquisition of Advantage and $181.7 million in cash for the
acquisition of InterPay.

Purchases of property and
equipment:

To support the
Company’s continued client and ancillary product growth,
purchases of property and equipment were made for data
processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and
upgrade of various operating facilities. In fiscal 2004, the
Company made purchases of property and equipment of
$50.6 million, compared with $60.2 million of
purchases in fiscal 2003, and $54.4 million in fiscal 2002.
The capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 include the purchase of
a 220,000-square-foot facility in Rochester, New York. In the
second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company placed into service a
consolidated data center to enhance data processing and disaster
recovery capabilities. Purchases of data processing equipment,
software, and building improvements in fiscal 2003 and 2002 for
the data center were approximately $12.2 million and
$18.3 million, respectively. Construction in progress
totaled $10.9 million and $5.0 million at May 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts primarily represent
costs for software being developed for internal use.

During fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2002,
the Company purchased approximately $1.2 million,
$2.6 million, and $11.2 million, respectively, of data
processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation, whose
President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board
of Directors of Paychex.

Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal
2005 are expected to be in the range of $65 million to
$70 million. The expected increase in fiscal 2005 capital
expenditures reflects higher anticipated purchases for printing
equipment, communication system upgrades, and branch expansions.
Fiscal 2005 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range
of $40 million to $45 million. In addition, the
Company projects amortization of intangible assets for fiscal
2005 to be in the range of $15 million to $16 million.


Financing Cash Flow Activities

Dividends
paid:

In October 2003, the Board
of Directors approved a 9.1% increase in the quarterly dividend
payment to $.12 per share from $.11 per share. In
October 2001, the Board of Directors approved a 22.2% increase
in the quarterly dividend payment to $.11 per share from
$.09 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net
income totaled 59%, 56%, and 57% in fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003,
and fiscal 2002, respectively. Future dividends are dependent on
the Company’s future earnings and cash flow and are subject
to the discretion of the Board of Directors.

Proceeds from exercise of stock
options:

The increase in proceeds
from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2004 compared with
fiscal 2003 is primarily due to an increase in both the average
exercise price per share and the number of shares exercised. The
decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in
fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is due to a decrease in
the number of shares exercised. Shares exercised in fiscal 2004
were 1.3 million compared with .8 million shares in
fiscal 2003, and 2.2 million shares in fiscal 2002. The
Company has recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock
options of $10.2 million, $5.5 million, and
$24.1 million for fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003, and fiscal
2002, respectively. This tax benefit reduces the accrued income
tax liability and increases additional paid-in capital, with no
impact on the expense amount for income taxes. See Note G
to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in
Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for additional disclosures
on the Company’s stock option plans.

Other

New accounting
pronouncements:

In August 2001,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which requires companies to record a
liability at fair value for asset retirement obligations in the
period in which they are incurred. The associated asset
retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount
of the long-lived asset. This Statement was effective for the
Company for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2003. The
Company adopted this Statement in the first quarter of fiscal
2004, with no material impact on its results of operations or
financial position.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities.” A variable interest entity is
an entity that has: (1) an insufficient amount of equity to
absorb the entity’s losses; (2) equity owners that do
not have voting rights; or (3) equity that does not absorb
the entity’s losses or residual returns. FIN 46
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by its
primary beneficiary, which is the company that is subject to a
majority of the risk of loss from the entity’s activities,
or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s
residual returns, or both. For Paychex, the effective date for
application of FIN 46 to variable interest entities created
before February 1, 2003, was the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004. The Company has investments in various U.S. real
estate partnership arrangements, which provide income tax
credits for the Company. These partnerships have been determined
to be variable interest entities as defined by FIN 46. At
May 31, 2004, the Company’s net invested equity in
these partnerships was approximately $6.1 million. The
Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of
these partnerships and, therefore, the Company’s adoption
of FIN 46 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 did not have
a material impact on its results of operations or financial
position.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” which
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133. This Statement clarifies under what
circumstances a contract with an initial net investment


meets the characteristic of a derivative under
SFAS No. 133, and clarifies when a derivative contains
a financing component that warrants special reporting in the
statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 is generally
effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated
after June 30, 2003. The Company currently does not utilize
derivative instruments and, therefore, the adoption of this
standard did not have an impact on its results of operations or
financial position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity,” which establishes standards for classifying and
measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that
embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 was
effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003. The Company currently does not issue
financial instruments covered within the scope of
SFAS No. 150 and, therefore, the adoption of this
standard did not have an impact on its results of operations or
financial position.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk

Market Risk Factors

Changes in interest rates and interest rate
risk:

Funds held for clients are
primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale
debt securities, and corporate investments are primarily
comprised of available-for-sale debt securities. Changes in
interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future
investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of
the Company’s longer-term available-for-sale investments.
The Company generally directs investments towards
high-credit-quality, fixed-rate municipal and government
securities and manages the available-for-sale portfolio to a
benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years. The
Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to
manage interest rate risk.

The Company’s investment portfolios and the
earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the
decreasing interest rate environment, as the federal funds rate
decreased from 6.50% at the end of fiscal 2000 to 1.00% at May
31, 2004. The decreasing interest rate environment has
negatively affected net income growth in fiscal years 2004,
2003, and 2002, and generated significant unrealized gains for
the Company’s longer-term available-for-sale portfolio
during most of the same periods. The Company has mitigated some
of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing
gains from the sale of investments. When interest rates begin to
rise, the full benefit of higher interest rates will not
immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of
long- and short-term interest rate changes, as discussed below.

Increases in interest rates increase earnings
from the Company’s short-term investments, which totaled
approximately $1.5 billion at May 31, 2004, and over
time will increase earnings from the Company’s longer-term
available-for-sale investments, which totaled approximately
$1.4 billion at May 31, 2004. Earnings from the
available-for-sale investments, which currently have an average
duration of 2.1 years, will not reflect increases in
interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the
proceeds are reinvested at higher rates. An increasing rate
environment will generally result in a decrease in the fair
value of the Company’s investment portfolio.


The following table summarizes the changes in the
Federal Funds rate over the past three fiscal years:

On June 29, 2004, the Federal Funds rate was
increased to 1.25%.

Calculating the future effects of changing
interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but
are not limited to, daily interest rate changes, seasonal
variations in investment balances, actual duration of short-term
and available-for-sale investments, the proportional mix of
taxable and tax-exempt investments, and changes in tax-exempt
municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not
synchronized or simultaneous. Subject to these factors, a
25-basis-point change generally affects the Company’s
tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.

The total investment portfolio is expected to
average approximately $3.3 billion in fiscal 2005. The
Company’s normal and anticipated allocation is
approximately 60% invested in short-term securities with an
average duration of thirty days and 40% invested in
available-for-sale municipal securities with an average duration
of two and one-half to three years. The Company estimates that
the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates
(17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at the
beginning of fiscal 2005 would be in the range of
$3.5 million to $4.0 million for fiscal 2005.

The combined funds held for clients and corporate
available-for-sale investment portfolios reflected a net
unrealized loss of $4.2 million at May 31, 2004,
compared with net unrealized gains of $45.0 million at
May 31, 2003, and $26.7 million at May 31, 2002.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, interest rates on
longer-term securities began to increase while short-term rates
remained fairly consistent. The three-year “AAA”
municipal securities yield increased to 2.50% at May 31,
2004, from 1.58% at February 29, 2004. This trend in
longer-term interest rates resulted in a decrease in the fair
value of the Company’s investment portfolios, as the
Company’s $25.0 million net unrealized gain position
at February 29, 2004, changed to a $4.2 million net
unrealized loss position at May 31, 2004. During fiscal
2004, the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from
approximately $7.6 million net unrealized loss to
$49.6 million net unrealized gain. The range of unrealized
gains in fiscal 2003 was $22.3 million to
$49.7 million. The net unrealized loss position of the
Company’s investment portfolios was approximately
$.3 million at July 14, 2004. See Note D of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for additional disclosures
about the Company’s investment portfolios.

As of May 31, 2004, and May 31, 2003,
the Company had $1.4 billion invested in available-for-sale
securities at fair value, with weighted average yields to
maturity of 2.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Assuming a hypothetical
increase in both short-term and longer-term interest rates of
25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in fair
value for the portfolio of securities at May 31, 2004,
would be in the range of $7.0 million to $7.5 million.
Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would
result in a comparable increase in fair value. This hypothetical
decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be
recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded
value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’
equity and with no related or immediate impact on the results of
operations.

Credit risk:

The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these
investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to
meet the terms of the bonds. The Company attempts to limit
credit risk by investing primarily in AAA- and AA-rated
securities and A-1-rated short-term securities, and by limiting
amounts that can be invested in any single instrument. At
May 31, 2004, all available-for-sale and short-term
securities classified as cash equivalents held an A-1 or
equivalent rating, with over 99% of available-for-sale
securities holding an AA rating or better.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Paychex, Inc. as of May 31, 2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended May 31, 2004. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Paychex, Inc.
at May 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended May 31, 2004, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

Note A — Significant Accounting
Policies

Business
activities:

Paychex, Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) are a
national provider of payroll, human resource, and employee
benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized
businesses in the United States. The Company reports one segment
based upon the provision of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (SFAS) No. 131, “Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”

Total revenues are comprised of service revenues
and interest on funds held for clients. Service revenues are
comprised of the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product
lines. Payroll service revenues are earned primarily from
payroll processing, tax filing and payment services, employee
payment services, and other ancillary services. Employee payment
services include the Direct Deposit, Readychex, and Access Card
product lines.

Payroll processing services include the
preparation of payroll checks; internal accounting records;
federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
and remittance of payroll obligations for small- to medium-sized
businesses.

In connection with the automated tax filing and
payment services, the Company collects payroll taxes
electronically from clients’ bank accounts typically on
payday, prepares and files the applicable tax returns, and
remits taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities on the due
date. These collections from clients are typically paid between
one and thirty days after receipt, with some items extending to
ninety days. The Company handles all regulatory correspondence,
amendments, and penalty and interest disputes, and is subject to
cash penalties imposed by tax authorities for late filings and
late or underpayment of taxes. With employee payment services,
employers are offered the option of paying their employees by
Direct Deposit, Access Card, a check drawn on a Paychex account
(Readychex), or a check drawn on the employer’s account.
For the first three methods, net payroll is collected
electronically from the client’s bank account typically one
day before the payroll date and provides payment to the employee
on payday. In connection with both the tax filing and payment
and employee payment services, authorized electronic money
transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential
risk of loss resulting from insufficient funds to cover such
transfers.

In addition to service fees paid by clients, the
Company earns interest on funds that are collected before due
dates and invested (funds held for clients) until remittance to
the applicable tax authorities or client employees. The funds
held for clients and related client deposit liability are
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as current assets
and current liabilities. The amount of funds held for clients
and related client deposit liability varies significantly during
the year.

The Human Resource and Benefits product line
provides small- to medium-sized businesses with 401(k) Plan
Recordkeeping, Workers’ Compensation Insurance
Administration, Section 125 Plan Administration, Group
Benefits, State Unemployment Insurance, and Employee Management
Services. The Company’s Paychex Administrative Services
(PAS) product provides a combined package of payroll,
employer compliance, employee benefits administration, and risk
management outsourcing services designed to make it easier for
businesses to manage their payroll and related benefits costs.
The Company also operates a Professional Employer Organization
(PEO), which provides primarily the same combined package of
services as the PAS product, but with Paychex acting as a
co-employer of the client’s employees.

Principles of
consolidation:

The Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of Paychex, Inc. and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and cash
equivalents:

Cash and cash
equivalents consist of available cash, money market securities,
and other investments with a maturity of three months or less
when purchased. Amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets approximate fair values.


PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Accounts receivable,
net:

Accounts receivable balances
are shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the
allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.3 million and
$2.2 million at May 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate
fair values.

Funds held for clients and corporate
investments:

Marketable securities
included in funds held for clients and corporate investments
consist primarily of debt securities classified as available for
sale and are recorded at fair value obtained from an independent
pricing service. Funds held for clients also include cash, money
market securities, and short-term investments. Unrealized gains
and losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported as
accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Realized gains and
losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific
identification of the security’s cost basis. On the
Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses
from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds
held for clients and realized gains and losses from corporate
investments are included in investment income, net.

Concentrations:

Substantially all of the Company’s deposited cash is
maintained at two large credit-worthy financial institutions.
These deposits may exceed the amount of any insurance provided.
All of the Company’s deliverable securities are held in
custody with one of the two aforementioned financial
institutions, for which that institution bears the risk of
custodial loss. Non-deliverable securities, primarily time
deposits and money market securities, are restricted to
credit-worthy broker-dealers and financial institutions.

Property and equipment,
net:

Property and equipment is
stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of property
and equipment using the straight-line method. The estimated
useful lives of depreciable assets are generally ten to
thirty-five years for buildings and improvements, two to seven
years for data processing equipment, three to five years for
software, seven years for furniture and fixtures, and two to ten
years for leasehold improvements. The Company reviews the
carrying value of property and equipment, including capitalized
software, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be
recoverable.

Software development and
enhancements:

Expenditures for
major software purchases and software developed for internal use
are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are
generally three to five years. For software developed for
internal use, all external direct costs for materials and
services and certain payroll and related fringe benefit costs
are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position
(SOP) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.”

Goodwill and other intangible assets,
net:

The Company has recorded
goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of businesses
during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, which are discussed in
Note B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, goodwill is
tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual
tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to
indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair
value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by
comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying
amount, including goodwill. The Company’s business is
largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all the
goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. The Company
performs its annual impairment testing at the beginning of the
fourth fiscal quarter. Based on the Company’s review, no
impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for
fiscal 2004.

Intangible assets are primarily comprised of
client list acquisitions and license agreements with
independently owned associate offices and are reported net of
accumulated amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Intangible assets are amortized over periods generally ranging
from five to twelve years using either straight-line or
accelerated methods. The Company tests intangible assets for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Other long-term
assets:

Other long-term assets are
primarily related to the Company’s investment as a limited
partner in various low-income housing partnerships. These
partnerships were determined to be


PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

variable-interest entities as defined by FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities.” The Company is not the primary
beneficiary of these variable interest entities and, therefore,
does not consolidate them in the Company’s results of
operations and financial position. The investments in these
partnerships are accounted for under the equity method, with the
Company’s share of partnership losses recorded in
investment income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The net investment in these entities recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets was $6.1 million at
May 31, 2004, and $6.5 million at May 31, 2003.

Revenue
recognition:

Service revenues are
recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Certain processing services are provided under annual service
arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
service period. The Company’s service revenues are largely
attributable to payroll-related processing services where the
fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed
amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or
transaction processed. Paychex provides delivery service for
many of its clients’ payroll checks and reports. The
revenue earned from delivery service is included in service
revenues, and the costs for the delivery are included in
operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Professional Employer Organization
(PEO) revenues are included in service revenues and are
reported net of direct costs billed and incurred for PEO
worksite employees, which include wages, taxes, benefit
premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs
billed and incurred were $1,846.1 million,
$1,460.7 million, and $1,056.9 million for fiscal
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned
primarily on tax filing and payment and employee payment
services funds that are collected before due dates and invested
(funds held for clients) until remittance to the applicable tax
authorities or client employees. These collections from clients
are typically remitted between one and thirty days after
receipt, with some items extending to ninety days. The interest
earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the
Consolidated Statements of Income because the collection,
holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components
of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients
also includes net realized gains and losses from the sale of
available-for-sale securities.

PEO workers’ compensation
insurance:

For fiscal 2003,
workers’ compensation insurance for PEO worksite employees
was provided under a pre-funded deductible workers’
compensation policy with a national insurance company. Under
this policy, the Company’s maximum individual claims
expense was $250,000 and the aggregate claims exposure was based
on a percentage of premium rates as applied to workers’
compensation payroll.

Based on claims experience, during the third
quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded approximately
$6.4 million of net incremental PEO revenue resulting from
a refund of insurance premiums and a reduction in estimated
claims loss exposure under the fiscal 2003 policy. The fiscal
2004 policy is similar to the fiscal 2003 policy, except that
the Company’s maximum individual claims liability is
$500,000. At May 31, 2004, the Company has recorded
$1.8 million in other current liabilities for workers’
compensation claims cost based on the estimated loss exposure
under the fiscal 2003 policy, and an estimated prepayment of
$5.0 million under the fiscal 2004 policy in prepaid
expenses and other current assets. These estimates may change in
the future based on claims experience trends.

Income taxes:

The Company accounts for deferred taxes by recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
accounts for the tax benefit


PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

from the exercise of non-qualified stock options
by reducing its accrued income tax liability and increasing
additional paid-in capital.

Stock-based compensation
costs:

SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” establishes
accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee
compensation plans. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the
Company accounts for such arrangements under Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is
recognized for stock option grants because the exercise price of
the stock options equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of the grant.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 provides
alternate methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the previous
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require
prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported financial results and requires these
disclosures in interim financial information. The Company
continues to account for stock-based employee compensation under
APB Opinion 25, but adopted the new disclosure requirements
of SFAS No. 148 beginning in the third quarter of
fiscal 2003.

The following table illustrates the pro forma
effect on net income and earnings per share as if the Company
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the stock option is amortized to expense
over the option’s vesting period. The weighted-average fair
value of stock options granted for the years ended May 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002 was $9.61, $8.66, and $11.78 per
share, respectively. The fair value of these stock options was
estimated at the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:


PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Additional information related to the
Company’s stock option plans is detailed in Note G of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of
estimates:

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual amounts and results could differ
from these estimates.

Newly issued accounting
standards:

In August 2001, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which requires companies to record
a liability at fair value for asset retirement obligations in
the period in which they are incurred. The associated asset
retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount
of the long-lived asset. This Statement was effective for the
Company for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2003. The
Company adopted this Statement in the first quarter of fiscal
2004, with no material impact on its results of operations or
financial position.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities.” A variable interest entity is
an entity that has: (1) an insufficient amount of equity to
absorb the entity’s losses; (2) equity owners that do
not have voting rights; or (3) equity that does not absorb
the entity’s losses or residual returns. FIN 46
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by its
primary beneficiary, which is the company that is subject to a
majority of the risk of loss from the entity’s activities,
or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s
residual returns, or both. For Paychex, the effective date for
application of FIN 46 to variable interest entities created
before February 1, 2003, was the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004. The Company has investments in various U.S. real
estate partnership arrangements, which provide income tax
credits for the Company. These partnerships have been determined
to be variable interest entities as defined by FIN 46. At
May 31, 2004, the Company’s net invested equity in
these partnerships was approximately $6.1 million. The
Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of
these partnerships and, therefore, the Company’s adoption
of FIN 46 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 had no
material impact on its results of operations or financial
position.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” which
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133. This Statement clarifies under what
circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets
the characteristic of a derivative under SFAS No. 133,
and clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component
that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows.
SFAS No. 149 is generally effective for contracts
entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for
hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The
Company currently does not utilize derivative instruments and,
therefore, the adoption of this standard did not have an impact
on its results of operations or financial position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity,” which establishes standards for classifying and
measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that
embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 was
effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003. The Company currently does not issue
financial instruments covered within the scope of
SFAS No. 150 and, therefore, the adoption of this
standard did not have an impact on its results of operations or
financial position.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect
on reported consolidated earnings.


PAYCHEX, INC.

STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Note B — Business
Combinations

Fiscal 2003 acquisitions:

In fiscal 2003, Paychex acquired
two comprehensive payroll processors that serviced small- to
medium-sized businesses throughout the United States. On
September 20, 2002, the Company acquired Advantage Payroll
Services, Inc. (“Advantage”) for $314.4 million
in cash including the redemption of preferred stock and the
repayment of outstanding debt of Advantage. On April 1,
2003, Paychex acquired InterPay, Inc. (“InterPay”), a
wholly owned subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation
(“Fleet®”), for $182.3 million in cash.

These acquisitions provided Paychex with over
80,000 new clients and geographic coverage into some areas that
were previously not served by the Company. In addition, the
integration of these companies provides Paychex the opportunity
to achieve economies of scale in providing services to its
clients. Results of operations for Advantage and InterPay are
included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from their
respective acquisition dates.

Advantage has license agreements with fifteen
independently owned associate offices. The associate offices are
responsible for selling and marketing Advantage services and
performing certain operational functions. Advantage provides all
centralized back-office payroll processing and tax filing
services for the associate offices, including the billing and
collection of processing fees and the collection and remittance
of payroll and payroll tax funds pursuant to Advantage’s
service arrangement with associate customers. Commissions earned
by the associate offices are based on the processing activity
for the related clients. Revenue generated from customers as a
result of these relationships and commissions paid to associates
are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as service
revenues and selling, general, and administrative expense,
respectively.

Purchase price allocations:

The cost to acquire Advantage and
InterPay has been allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed according to estimated fair values at the
respective dates of acquisition. During fiscal year 2004, the
Company recorded adjustments to the estimated fair values and
for additional purchase price required, which increased goodwill
by $.4 million. The following table summarizes the
estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed for each of the acquired entities.

The amounts assigned to funds held for clients
represent investments in marketable securities, primarily money
markets and other cash equivalents as well as mutual funds and
debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale
securities. These investments were recorded at fair value
obtained from an independent pricing service as of the
acquisition date. The amounts assigned to client fund deposits
liability represent the cash collected from clients for payroll
and tax payment obligations, which had not yet been remitted to
the related client employees or tax agencies.


PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

The amounts assigned to intangible assets
primarily represent client lists and license agreements with
associate offices and were based on independent appraisals. The
intangible assets will be amortized over periods generally
ranging from five to twelve years using either accelerated or
straight-line methods, based on the provisions of
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.”

In connection with the acquisitions of Advantage
and InterPay, the Company recorded $10.0 million of
severance and $5.9 million of redundant lease liabilities
in the allocation of the purchase price under Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF) 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with a Purchase Combination.”

The Advantage purchase price allocation included
$1.8 million of severance and $3.3 million of
redundant lease liabilities. Approximately $1.4 million was
paid in fiscal 2003, and $1.4 million was paid in fiscal
2004, for Advantage severance and redundant lease costs. The
purchase price allocation for InterPay included
$8.2 million of severance and $2.6 million of
redundant lease liabilities. Approximately $3.3 million was
paid in fiscal 2003, and $2.8 million was paid in fiscal
2004, for InterPay severance and redundant lease costs. The
severance payments for both acquisitions are expected to be
substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2005. The majority
of the redundant lease payments are expected to be complete in
fiscal 2007, with the remaining payments extending until 2015.

The amount of goodwill allocated to the Advantage
purchase price was $241.8 million, which is not deductible
for tax purposes. The amount of goodwill allocated to the
InterPay purchase price was $152.2 million, nearly all of
which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes as the
acquisition includes a section 338(h)(10) tax election.

Pro forma financial information:

The following table sets forth the
unaudited pro forma results of operations of the Company for the
years ended May 31, 2003 and May 31, 2002,
respectively. The unaudited pro forma financial information
summarizes the results of operations for the periods indicated
as if the Advantage and InterPay acquisitions had occurred at
the beginning of each of the annual periods presented. The pro
forma information contains the actual combined operating results
of Paychex, Advantage, and InterPay, with the results prior to
the acquisition date adjusted to include the pro forma impact
of: the amortization of acquired intangible assets, the
elimination of Advantage’s interest expense and preferred
stock dividends, and lower interest income as a result of the
sale of available-for-sale securities to fund the two
acquisitions. The Company realized a total of $10.5 million
of gains related to the sale of corporate investments to fund
the acquisitions. These gains are included in each pro forma
period presented as if they occurred at the beginning of that
period. These pro forma amounts do not purport to be indicative
of the results that would have actually been obtained if the
acquisitions occurred as of the beginning of each of the periods
presented or that may be obtained in the future.

Fiscal 2004 acquisition:

During fiscal 2004, the Company
expanded its product offerings to include time and attendance
products. Effective April 12, 2004, Paychex acquired
substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of
Stromberg LLC (“Stromberg”), a provider of time and
attendance software solutions for mid- to large-sized
businesses, for approximately $13.6 million. The Company
paid $12.6 million at the date of acquisition and an
additional $1.0 million is expected to be paid in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Paychex had purchased
Stromberg’s Time In A Box product, a time and
attendance solution for small- to medium-

sized businesses, in October 2003. The purchase
price was allocated to the assets and liabilities of Stromberg
based on their fair values as follows:

The amount assigned to property and equipment
primarily represents the fair value of software and is based
upon an independent appraisal. The goodwill balance is
deductible for tax purposes.

Note C — Basic and Diluted
Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share were
calculated as follows:

Weighted-average anti-dilutive stock options to
purchase shares of common stock were excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share. These options had an
exercise price that was greater than the average market price of
the common shares for the period; therefore, the effect would
have been anti-dilutive.


PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Note D — Funds Held for Clients
and Corporate Investments

Funds held for clients and corporate investments
at May 31, 2004 and 2003, are as follows:

The Company is exposed to credit risk from the
possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their
bonds. In addition, the Company is exposed to interest rate
risk, as rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the market
value of held investments and the earnings potential of future
investments. The Company attempts to limit these risks by
investing primarily in AAA- and AA-rated securities and
A-1-rated short-term securities, limiting amounts that can be
invested in any single instrument, and by investing in short- to
intermediate-term instruments whose market value is less
sensitive to interest rate changes. At May 31, 2004, all
short-term securities classified as cash equivalents and all
available-for-sale securities held at least an A-1 or equivalent
rating, with over 99% of the available-for-sale bond securities
holding an AA rating or better. The Company does not utilize
derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.

Unrealized gains and losses of the
available-for-sale securities, are as follows:

The $11.1 million in gross unrealized losses
are related to 257 available-for-sale debt securities, which had
a fair value of $876.0 million at May 31, 2004. These
securities have been in an unrealized loss position for less
than twelve months. The Company periodically reviews its
investment portfolios to determine if any investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or
other potential valuation


PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

concerns. At May 31, 2004, Paychex believes
that the investments that it holds are not
other-than-temporarily impaired. While certain
available-for-sale debt securities have fair values that are
below cost, the Company believes that it is probable that
principal and interest will be collected in accordance with
contractual terms, and that the decline in market value is due
to changes in interest rates and not due to increased credit
risk. At May 31, 2004, all bond securities in an unrealized
loss position held and AA rating or better. The Company
currently believes that it has the ability and intent to hold
these investments until the earlier of market price recovery or
maturity. The Company’s assessment that an investment is
not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future
due to new developments or changes in the Company’s
strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.

Realized gains and losses are as follows:

The cost and fair value of available-for-sale
securities at May 31, 2004, by contractual maturity, are
shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual
maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay
obligations without prepayment penalties.

Note G — Stock Option
Plans

On July 11, 2002, the Board of Directors of
the Company adopted the Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan
(“2002 Plan”), which became effective upon stockholder
approval at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders on
October 17, 2002. The 2002 Plan authorizes the granting of
options to purchase up to 9.1 million  shares of the
Company’s common stock, of which 1.6 million shares
were authorized by the stockholders for the Paychex, Inc. 1998
Stock Incentive Plan (“1998 Plan”), but were not
optioned under the 1998 Plan, and 7.5 million shares were
newly authorized for options. At May 31, 2004, there were
5.5 million shares available for future grants under this
Plan.

No future grants will be made from the 1998 Plan,
or the 1995 and 1992 Stock Incentive Plans, which expired in
August 1998 and 1995, respectively. However, options to
purchase 7.0 million shares under these three plans
remain outstanding at May 31, 2004.

The exercise price for the shares subject to
options of the Company’s common stock is equal to the fair
market value on the date of the grant. All stock option grants
have a contractual life of ten years from the date of the grant.
Non-qualified stock option grants vest at 33.3% after two years
of service from the date of the grant, with annual vesting at
33.3% thereafter.

The Company has granted stock options to
employees in the following broad-based incentive stock option
grants:

Subsequent to each of the broad-based grants,
each April and October, the Company granted options to newly
hired employees who met certain criteria.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

A reconciliation of the U.S. federal
statutory tax rate to the effective rates reported for income
before taxes for the three years ending May 31, 2004, is as
follows:

As of May 31, 2004, the Company had
approximately $1.4 million in acquired operating loss
carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. The
acquired operating loss carryforwards expire through the year
2022. The Company believes that future taxable income will be
sufficient to fully utilize these operating loss carryforwards.

Income

The following table sets forth the related tax
effects allocated to unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities, which is the only component of
other comprehensive income:

At May 31, 2004, accumulated other

$1.5 million. At May 31, 2003, accumulated other
comprehensive income was $28.7 million, net of tax of
$16.3 million.

Note J — Supplemental Cash Flow

Non-cash financing
transactions:

The Company recorded
the tax benefit from the exercise of non-qualified stock options

respectively.

Note K — Employee Benefit
Plans

401(k) Plans:

The Company maintains contributory savings plans that qualify
under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The
Paychex, Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan allows all
employees to immediately participate in the salary deferral
portion of the Plan, contributing up to a maximum of 50% of


PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

their salary. Employees who have completed one
year of service are eligible to receive a company matching
contribution. The Company currently matches 50% of an
employee’s voluntary contribution up to 6% of a
participant’s gross wages.

This Plan is 100% participant-directed. Plan
participants can fully diversify their portfolios by choosing
from any or all investment fund choices in the Plan. Transfers
in and out of investment funds, including the Paychex, Inc. ESOP
Stock Fund (“Stock Fund”), are not restricted in any
manner. The Company match contribution follows the same fund
elections as the employee compensation deferrals.

Effective April 15, 2002, the Plan was
amended to add an Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP) feature to the Stock Fund under section 404(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this ESOP feature,
participants have voting rights for their ownership of Paychex
stock within the Plan. Participants are able to elect to receive
dividends on their shares of Paychex stock in the form of cash
or have them reinvested into the Stock Fund.

On February 28, 2003, the Advantage Business
Services Holdings, Inc. 401(k) Incentive Plan was merged into
the Paychex, Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan. On
January 2, 2004, the InterPay, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan
was merged into the Paychex, Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement
Plan.

Company contributions to the 401(k) plans for the
years ended May 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 were
$7.1 million, $6.3 million, and $5.7 million,
respectively.

Deferred Compensation
Plans:

The Company offers a
non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan to a select group of
key employees that provides these employees with the opportunity
to defer up to 100% of their annual base salary and bonus. This
Plan also allows non-employee Directors to defer 100% of their
Board compensation. The amounts accrued under this Plan were
$4.5 million and $3.4 million at May 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively, and are reflected in other long-term
liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Prior to the April 1, 2003 acquisition,
InterPay entered into various salary continuation agreements
with certain former employees. These agreements provide for
benefits to these retired employees, and in certain cases to
their beneficiaries, for life or other designated periods
through 2015. The amounts accrued under these agreements were
$1.9 million and $2.1 million at May 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively, and represent the estimated present value of
the benefits earned under these agreements.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan:

The Company offers an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible employees may
purchase common stock of the Company at current market prices.
All transactions occur directly through the Company’s
Transfer Agent and no brokerage fees are charged to employees,
except for when stock is sold.

Note L — Commitments and
Contingencies

Lines of
credit:

The Company has borrowing
capacity available under three uncommitted, short-term lines of
credit with financial institutions at market rates of interest
as follows:

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be
to meet short-term funding requirements related to client fund
deposit obligations or to fund normal business operations, if
necessary. The secured line of credit is collateralized
primarily by securities in the Company’s investment
portfolios. No amounts were outstanding


PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

against these lines of credit during fiscal 2004
or at May 31, 2004 and 2003. The Company expects to renew
the short-term line of credit which expires at the end of July
2004.

Letters of
credit:

The Company had standby
letters of credit outstanding totaling $8.4 million and
$7.1 million at May 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
which are required for certain insurance policies. The letters
of credit outstanding at May 31, 2004, expire at various
dates between December 2004 and December 2005. In June 2004, the
Company entered into a $24.5 million letter of credit
arrangement to secure a commitment for an insurance policy. The
letters of credit are secured by securities in the
Company’s investment portfolios.

Contingencies:

The Company is subject to various claims and legal matters that
arise in the normal course of business. These include disputes
related to breach of contract, employment-related claims,
intellectual property infringement, and other matters.

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary,
Rapid Payroll, Inc., are defendants in twenty-two lawsuits
pending in Los Angeles Superior Court and the United States
District Court for the Central District of California brought by
licensees of payroll processing software owned by Rapid Payroll.
In August of 2001, Rapid Payroll informed seventy-six licensees
that it intended to stop supporting the software in August of
2002. Thereafter, thirty lawsuits were commenced by licensees
asserting various claims, including breach of contract and
related tort and fraud causes of action. These lawsuits seek
compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief
against Rapid Payroll, the Company, its Chief Executive Officer,
and its Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. In
accordance with the Company’s indemnification agreements
with its senior executives, the Company will defend and, if
necessary, indemnify the individual defendants as it relates to
these pending matters. On July 5, 2002, the federal court
entered a preliminary injunction requiring that Rapid Payroll
and the Company continue to support and maintain the subject
software pursuant to the license agreements. The Company has
reached resolutions with certain licensees, resulting in the
dismissal of eight lawsuits, which included payments totaling
approximately $1.6 million. The Company, Rapid Payroll, and
the individual defendants are vigorously defending the remaining
twenty-two actions, which are in various stages. Among other
defenses, Rapid Payroll asserts that its liability is limited,
by express contractual provisions, to the amount of fees paid
under the license agreements. The Company and other defendants
have been granted several motions for summary judgment
dismissing various claims, and other such motions are pending or
anticipated upon completion of discovery.

On June 18, 2004, a Superior Court jury
found that Rapid Payroll had breached its license agreement with
Payroll Partnership, L.P. and two related entities. The jury
awarded approximately $6.4 million in compensatory damages
against Rapid Payroll, which plans to file post-trial motions
and, if necessary, to appeal. The Superior Court dismissed other
claims against Rapid Payroll, the Company, and the individual
defendants, including fraud and tort causes of action. The six
remaining state court cases are to be tried one after the other
in Superior Court, beginning with a jury trial currently
scheduled to begin on August 23, 2004. Discovery and
motions are continuing in the federal court cases, with the
first trial currently scheduled to start in January 2005.

Based on the application of SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies,” the Company is
required to record a reserve if it believes an unfavorable
outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be
reasonably estimated. During the third and fourth quarters of
fiscal 2004, the Company recorded $9.2 million and
$26.6 million, respectively, in expense to increase the
reserve for the estimated costs associated with the resolution
of pending legal matters. The legal reserve totaled
$35.0 million and $1.1 million at May 31, 2004,
and May 31, 2003, respectively, and is included in other
current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This
reserve may change in the future due to new developments or
changes in the Company’s strategies.

In light of the legal reserve recorded, the
Company’s management currently believes that resolution of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of


PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

operations. However, these matters are subject to
inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the
ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material
adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and the
results of operations in the period in which any such effect is
recorded.

Lease
commitments:

The Company leases
office space and data processing equipment under terms of
various operating leases, with most data processing equipment
leases containing a purchase option at prices representing the
fair value of the equipment at expiration of the lease term.
Rent expense for the years ended May 31, 2004, 2003, and
2002 was $37.7 million, $36.6 million, and
$33.9 million, respectively. At May 31, 2004, future
minimum lease payments under various non-cancelable operating
leases with terms of more than one year are as follows:

The amounts shown above for operating leases
include obligations under redundant leases related to Advantage
and InterPay.

Other
commitments:

At May 31, 2004,
the Company had outstanding commitments under purchase orders
and legally binding contractual arrangements with minimum future
payment obligations of approximately $32.8 million,
including $5.4 million of commitments to purchase capital
assets.

In the normal course of business, the Company
makes representations and warranties that guarantee the
performance of the Company’s services under service
arrangements with clients. The Company has entered into
indemnification agreements with its Officers and Directors,
which require the Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify
these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as
they relate to their services to Paychex and its subsidiaries.
Historically, there have been no material losses related to such
guarantees and indemnifications.

Paychex currently self-insures the deductible
portion of various insured exposures under certain employee
benefit plans. The Company’s estimated loss exposure under
these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current
liabilities. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been
material.

Note M — Related
Parties

During the fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, the
Company purchased approximately $1.2 million,
$2.6 million, and $11.2 million, respectively, of data
processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation, whose
President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board
of Directors of Paychex.
