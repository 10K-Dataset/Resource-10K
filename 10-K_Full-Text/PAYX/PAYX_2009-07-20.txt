“SAFE
    HARBOR” STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION
    REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain written and oral statements made by management of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“we,”
    “our,” “us,” or the “Company”) may
    constitute “forward-looking statements” as defined in
    the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the
    “Reform Act”). Forward-looking statements are
    identified by such words and phrases as “we expect,”
    “expected to,” “estimates,”
    “estimated,” “current outlook,” “we
    look forward to,” “would equate to,”
    “projects,” “projections,” “projected
    to be,” “anticipates,” “anticipated,”
    “we believe,” “could be,” and other similar
    phrases. All statements addressing operating performance,
    events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur
    in the future, including statements relating to revenue growth,
    earnings, earnings- per-share growth, or similar projections,
    are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform
    Act. Because they are forward-looking, they should be evaluated
    in light of important risk factors. These risk factors include,
    but are not limited to, the following risks as well as those
    described in “Risk Factors” under Item 1A and
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Form 10-K”):

•

general market and economic conditions including, among others,
    changes in United States (“U.S.”) employment and wage
    levels, changes in new hiring trends, legislative changes to
    stimulate the economy, changes in short- and long-term interest
    rates, changes in the fair value and the credit rating of
    securities held by us, and accessibility of financing;

•

changes in demand for our services and products, ability to
    develop and market new services and products effectively,
    pricing changes and the impact of competition, and the
    availability of skilled workers;

•

changes in the laws regulating collection and payment of payroll
    taxes, professional employer organizations, and employee
    benefits, including retirement plans, workers’
    compensation, health insurance, state unemployment, and
    section 125 plans;

•

changes in workers’ compensation rates and underlying
    claims trends;

•

the possibility of failure to keep pace with technological
    changes and provide timely enhancements to services and products;

•

the possibility of failure of our operating facilities, computer
    systems, and communication systems during a catastrophic event;

•

the possibility of third-party service providers failing to
    perform their functions;

•

the possibility of penalties and losses resulting from errors
    and omissions in performing services;

•

the possible inability of our clients to meet their payroll
    obligations;

•

the possible failure of internal controls or our inability to
    implement business processing improvements; and

•

potentially unfavorable outcomes related to pending legal
    matters.

Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from our anticipated results. The information
    provided in this

Form 10-K

is based upon the facts and circumstances known at this time. We
    undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking
    statements after the date of filing of this

Form 10-K

with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
    “Commission”) to reflect events or circumstances after
    such date, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Item 1.

Business

We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll, human
    resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to
    medium-sized businesses. As of May 31, 2009, we serviced
    approximately 554,000 clients and had approximately
    12,500 employees. We maintain our corporate headquarters in
    Rochester, New York, and have more than 100 offices nationwide.



As of May 31, 2009, we serviced approximately 1,600 clients
    in Germany through four offices.

Our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in 1979. We
    report our results of operations and financial condition as one
    business segment. Our fiscal year ends May 31.

Company
    Strategy

We are focused on achieving strong, long-term financial
    performance by:

•

providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable
    comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource services;

•

delivering these services utilizing a well-trained and
    responsive work force through a network of local and corporate
    offices servicing more than 100 of the largest markets in the
    U.S.;

•

growing our client base, primarily through the efforts of our
    direct sales force;

•

continually improving client service and maximizing client
    retention;

•

capitalizing on the growth opportunities within our current
    client base and from new clients by increasing utilization of
    our payroll and human resource ancillary services and products;

•

capitalizing on and leveraging our highly developed
    technological and operating infrastructure;

•

investing in our business through expansion of our service and
    product offerings to continually add value for our
    clients; and

•

supplementing our growth through strategic acquisitions when
    appropriate opportunities arise.

Market
    Opportunities

Outsourcing of payroll and human resource functions allows
    small- to medium-sized businesses to minimize the administrative
    burden and compliance risks associated with increasingly complex
    and changing administrative requirements and federal, state, and
    local tax regulations. By utilizing the expertise of outsourcing
    service providers, businesses are better able to efficiently
    meet their compliance requirements and administrative burdens
    while, at the same time, providing competitive benefits for
    their employees. The technical capabilities, knowledge, and
    operational expertise that we have built, along with the broad
    portfolio of ancillary services and products we offer our
    clients, have enabled us to capitalize on the trend to outsource
    these types of services.

Industry data indicates there are approximately
    11.5 million employers in the geographic markets that we
    currently serve within the U.S. Of those employers,
    approximately 99% have fewer than 100 employees and are our
    primary customers and target market. Based on publicly available
    industry data, we estimate that all payroll processors combined
    serve approximately 10% to 15% of the potential businesses in
    the target market, with much of the unpenetrated market being
    composed of businesses with ten or fewer employees. We remain
    focused on servicing small- to medium-sized businesses based
    upon the growth potential that we believe exists in this market
    segment.

Clients

We serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients
    operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the
    U.S. As of May 31, 2009, we serviced approximately
    554,000 clients. We utilize service agreements and arrangements
    with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any
    time or upon relatively short notice. For the year ended
    May 31, 2009 (“fiscal 2009”), client retention
    was approximately 77% of our beginning of the fiscal year client
    base. The most significant factor impacting client retention is
    clients going out of business or no longer having any employees,
    which increased 17% for fiscal 2009. This, along with pricing
    pressure from our largest direct competitor and regional payroll
    providers, kept our client retention rate slightly below
    historical levels. No single client has a material impact on
    total service revenue or results of operations.

Services
    and Products

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services and products that
    allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human
    resource needs. These include:

•

payroll processing;

•

payroll tax administration services;

•

employee payment services;

•

regulatory compliance services (new-hire reporting and
    garnishment processing);

•

comprehensive human resource outsourcing services;

•

retirement services administration;

•

health and benefits services;

•

workers’ compensation insurance services;

•

time and attendance solutions; and

•

other human resource services and products.

By offering ancillary services that leverage the information
    gathered in the base payroll processing service, we are able to
    provide comprehensive outsourcing services that allow employers
    to expand their employee benefits offerings at an affordable
    cost. We mainly earn our revenue through recurring fees for
    services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the
    number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay
    period, and utilization of ancillary services.

Payroll
    Processing

Payroll processing is the foundation of our service portfolio.
    Our payroll service includes the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; preparation of
    federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
    and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations. Payroll
    processing clients are charged a base fee each period that
    payroll is processed, plus a fee per employee check processed.
    Our payroll services are provided through either our core
    payroll or Major Market Services (“MMS”) and are made
    available to clients via traditional or Internet-based methods.

Paychex Online is our secure Internet site, which offers core
    payroll clients a suite of self-service, interactive services
    and products twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. These
    include Paychex Online
    Payroll

®

,

    Internet Time Sheet, Paychex Online Reports, and General Ledger
    Reporting Service. Clients can communicate payroll information
    through the Internet Time Sheet or use the Online Payroll
    service, and can access current and historical payroll
    information using Paychex Online Reports. The General Ledger
    Reporting Service transfers payroll information calculated by us
    to the clients’ general ledger accounting software,
    eliminating manual entries and improving the accuracy of
    bookkeeping. Approximately

one-half

of
    our clients are currently utilizing some form of Paychex Online
    payroll service.



Major Market Services:

MMS primarily
    targets companies that have more complex payroll and benefits
    needs or have outgrown our core payroll service. We currently
    offer this service in all of our significant markets.
    Approximately one-third of new MMS clients are conversions from
    our core payroll service.

We offer a software-as-a-service solution to meet the payroll
    and human resource administrative needs of our MMS clients. Our
    proprietary MMS software,
    Preview

®

,

    provides a powerful payroll solution and allows smooth
    integration with other Paychex service offerings. Preview can be
    used as an

on-site,

PC-based system or via a secure web-hosted environment.

Preview can be integrated with various Internet-based services
    offered to assist clients with their administrative human
    resource and payroll needs, in every step of the employee life
    cycle. Ancillary services particularly offered to our MMS
    clients include Paychex HR Online, BeneTrac, Paychex Time and
    Labor Online, Paychex Expense Manager, and applicant tracking.
    Paychex HR Online, our Internet-based human resource management
    system, offers powerful tools for managing employee benefits,
    personnel information, and critical human resource compliance
    and reporting needs. In addition, its self-service features
    allow for better communication between management and employees.
    BeneTrac, our employee benefits management and administration
    system, provides our MMS clients a simple, accurate, and
    cost-effective solution for streamlined benefits management.
    Paychex Time and Labor Online makes the time and attendance
    process more efficient. This solution can reduce time spent on
    preparing timesheets, minimize redundant data entry, increase
    awareness of critical labor information, and aid in compliance
    with federal time recording requirements. Paychex Expense
    Manager is an integrated payroll and expense management solution
    that allows clients to control discretionary spending while
    giving employees an easy-to-use, secure tool to prepare and
    submit expense reports online. We have also partnered with Taleo
    Corporation for applicant tracking, providing our MMS clients
    with a tool to manage their recruiting process in order to
    better hire and retain talented employees.

In addition, MMS clients can select from a number of á la
    carte payroll and human resource ancillary services or opt for
    our comprehensive human resource and payroll outsourcing
    solution, Paychex
    Premier

®

Human Resources (“Paychex Premier”). This flexibility
    allows our clients to define the solution that best meets their
    particular needs.

Ancillary
    Services and Products

We provide our clients with a portfolio of ancillary services
    and products that have been developed and refined over many
    years. Ancillary services and products provide us with
    additional recurring revenue streams and increased service
    efficiencies as these services and products are integrated with
    our payroll processing services. We offer the following
    ancillary services and products:

Payroll tax administration services:

As
    of May 31, 2009, 93% of our clients utilized our payroll
    tax administration services (including
    Taxpay

®

),

    which provide accurate preparation and timely filing of
    quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic
    transfer of funds to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies
    (federal, state, and local). Nearly all of our new clients
    purchase our payroll tax administration services. In connection
    with these services, we electronically collect payroll taxes
    from clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare
    and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due
    dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and
    30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with
    some items extending to 90 days. We handle regulatory
    correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes,
    and we are subject to cash penalties imposed by tax or
    regulatory agencies for late filings and late or under payment
    of taxes. Clients utilizing the payroll tax administration
    services are charged a base fee and a fee per transaction for
    each period that payroll is processed. In addition to fees paid
    by clients, we earn interest on client funds that are collected
    before due dates and invested until remittance to the applicable
    tax or regulatory agencies.

Employee payment services:

As of
    May 31, 2009, 75% of our clients utilized our employee
    payment services, which provide the employer the option of
    paying their employees by direct deposit, Chase Pay Card

Plus

, a check drawn on a Paychex, Inc. account
    (Readychex

®

),

    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by us. More than 80% of new clients select
    some form of employee payment services. For the first three
    methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the
    clients’ bank account, typically one business day before
    payday, and provide payment to the employee on payday. Our
    flexible payment options provide



a cost-effective solution that offers the benefit of convenient,
    one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers. Clients
    utilizing employee payment services are charged a base fee for
    each period that payroll is processed and a fee per transaction
    or per employee depending on the service provided. In addition
    to fees paid by clients, we earn interest on client funds that
    are collected before pay dates and invested until remittance to
    clients’ employees.

Regulatory compliance services:

We
    offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to
    comply with federal and state requirements to report information
    on newly hired employees. This information aids the government
    in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent
    unemployment and workers’ compensation insurance claims.
    Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from
    employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies,
    including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the
    obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to
    comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties.

Comprehensive human resource outsourcing
    services:

Paychex Premier provides businesses
    a full-service approach to the outsourcing of employer and
    employee administrative needs. Paychex Premier offers businesses
    a combined package of services that includes payroll, employer
    compliance, human resource and employee benefits administration,
    risk management outsourcing, and the

on-site

availability of a professionally trained human resource
    representative. This comprehensive bundle of services is
    designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
    payroll and related benefit costs while providing a benefits
    package equal to that of larger companies. Our Professional
    Employer Organization (“PEO”) provides businesses with
    primarily the same services as Paychex Premier, except we serve
    as a co-employer of the clients’ employees, assume the
    risks and rewards of workers’ compensation insurance, and
    provide more sophisticated health care offerings to PEO clients.
    Our PEO service is available primarily for clients domiciled in
    select U.S. states where the utilization of PEOs is more
    prevalent. We offer our PEO service through our subsidiary,
    Paychex Business Solutions, Inc. For comprehensive human
    resource outsourcing services, the client pays a fee per
    employee per processing period. As of May 31, 2009,
    comprehensive human resource outsourcing services were utilized
    by 18,000 clients with approximately 453,000 client employees.

Retirement services administration:

Our
    retirement services product line offers a variety of options to
    clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE, SIMPLE IRA,
    401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, profit sharing, and
    money purchase plans. These services provide plan
    implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations,
    employee and employer reporting, participant and employer access
    online, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative
    services. In fiscal 2009, we introduced auto enrollment as an
    optional plan feature, which allows employers to automatically
    enroll their employees in their company’s 401(k) plan and
    increase overall plan participation. Clients have the ability to
    choose from a group of pre-defined fund selections or to
    customize their investment options within their plan. Selling
    efforts for these services are focused primarily on our existing
    payroll client base, as the processed payroll information allows
    for data integration necessary to provide these services
    efficiently. We are one of the largest 401(k) recordkeepers for
    small businesses in the U.S. Clients utilizing this service
    are charged a one-time set up fee, a monthly recurring fee, and
    a fee per employee. We earn a fee approximating thirty basis
    points from the external fund managers based on the total asset
    value of client employee 401(k) funds. The asset value of client
    employee 401(k) funds externally managed totaled approximately
    $8.5 billion as of May 31, 2009. Retirement services
    were utilized by approximately 50,000 clients as of May 31,
    2009.

Health and benefits services:

We offer
    health and benefits services through our licensed insurance
    agency, acting as general agent to provide insurance through a
    variety of carriers who are underwriters. Our services include
    shopping for the best plans, providing comparisons of national
    and regional insurers to match features and affordability to the
    client’s needs, informing and enrolling employees, tracking
    additions and terminations, calculating and initiating payroll
    deductions, communicating with the insurance carriers, and
    assisting with renewal of policies. These services simplify the
    insurance process while allowing access to group rates, enabling
    our clients to offer valuable benefits to their employees at an
    affordable cost.

Workers’ compensation insurance
    services:

Most employers are required to
    carry workers’ compensation insurance, which provides
    payments to employees who are unable to work because of
    job-related injuries. We provide workers’ compensation
    insurance services through our licensed insurance agency, acting
    as general agent to provide insurance through a variety of
    insurance carriers who are underwriters. Our Workers’
    Compensation Payment Service uses rate and job classification
    information to enable clients to pay workers’ compensation



premiums in regular monthly amounts rather than with large
    up-front payments, which stabilizes their cash flow and
    minimizes year-end adjustments. Our Workers’ Compensation
    Report Service provides our clients with comprehensive
    information to allow them to better manage workers’
    compensation insurance costs. As of May 31, 2009,
    approximately 77,000 clients utilized our workers’
    compensation insurance services.

Time and attendance solutions:

We offer
    Time In A
    Box

®

,

    Paychex Time and Labor Online, and other time and attendance
    solutions, which help employers minimize the time spent
    compiling time sheet information. These computer-based systems
    allow the employer flexibility to handle multiple payroll
    scenarios and result in improved productivity, accuracy, and
    reliability in the payroll process. Certain clients are charged
    a monthly fee for use of hardware, software, and support.
    Clients also have the option to purchase the hardware and
    software with annual maintenance contracts.

Other human resource services and
    products:

We offer the outsourcing of plan
    administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for
    certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care
    expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation,
    administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement,
    and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer
    state unemployment insurance services, which provide clients
    with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations,
    change statements, and requests for separation documents. Other
    Human Resource Services products include employee handbooks,
    management manuals, and personnel and required regulatory forms.
    These products are designed to simplify clients’ office
    processes and enhance their employee benefits programs.

Sales and
    Marketing

We market our services primarily through our direct sales force
    based in the metropolitan markets we serve. Our sales
    representatives specialize in payroll or Human Resource
    Services. For the year ending May 31, 2010, our sales force
    is expected to total approximately 2,370 and is expected to be
    comprised of the following categories of sales representatives:

Payroll

1,590

Retirement services administration and other human resource
    services


Comprehensive human resource outsourcing services


Licensed agents for health and benefits services


Licensed agents for workers’ compensation insurance


Total sales representatives

2,370

In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we
    utilize relationships with existing clients, certified public
    accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client
    referrals. More than 60% of our new clients (excluding
    acquisitions) come from these referral sources. To further
    enhance our strong relationship with CPAs, we have partnered
    with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll provider for its
    AICPA Business Solutions Partner Program. As of May 31,
    2009, more than 30,000 CPA firms nationwide participated in this
    program, which includes our payroll services and retirement
    services administration.

Our website at

www.paychex.com

, which includes online
    payroll sales presentations and service and product information,
    is a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of leads and
    new sales while complementing the efforts of our direct sales
    force. This online tool allows us to market to clients in more
    geographically remote areas. Our sales representatives are also
    supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade
    shows, and telemarketing programs. We have grown and expect to
    continue to grow our direct sales force in key areas, primarily
    MMS and health and benefits services. In recent years, we have
    increased our emphasis on the selling of ancillary services and
    products to both new clients and our existing client base.

In addition, Advantage Payroll Services Inc.
    (“Advantage”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex,
    Inc., has license agreements with independently owned associate
    offices (“Associates”), which are responsible for
    selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing
    certain operational functions, while Paychex, Inc. and



Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll processing
    and payroll tax administration services. The marketing and
    selling by the Associates is conducted under their own logos.

Competition

The market for payroll processing and human resource services is
    highly competitive and fragmented. We believe our primary
    national competitor,
    ADP

®

(“Automatic Data Processing, Inc.”), is the largest
    U.S. third-party provider of payroll processing and human
    resource services in terms of revenue. We compete with other
    national, regional, local, and online service providers, all of
    which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us.

In addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource
    service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and human
    resource systems and departments. Payroll and human resource
    systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our Human
    Resource Services also compete with a variety of providers of
    human resource services, such as retirement services companies,
    insurance companies, and human resources and benefits consulting
    firms.

Competition in the payroll processing and human resource
    services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness,
    product quality and reputation, breadth of service and product
    offering, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of
    these areas.

Software
    Maintenance and Development

The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and
    regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the
    proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human
    resource services to our clients. We are continually engaged in
    developing enhancements to and maintenance of our various
    software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our
    clients and the marketplace.

Employees

As of May 31, 2009, we employed approximately
    12,500 people. None of our employees were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements.

Intellectual
    Property

We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names,
    copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and
    software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a
    whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the
    conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be
    appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual
    property rights, including, but not limited to,
    confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with
    employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with
    licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and
    registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the
    “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material
    importance to us.

Seasonality

There is no significant seasonality to our business. However,
    during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the
    number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients,
    and new Paychex Premier and PEO worksite employees tends to be
    higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily
    because a majority of new clients begin using our services in
    the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end
    transaction processing and client funds activity are
    traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to
    clients paying year-end bonuses and requesting additional
    year-end services. Historically, as a result of these factors,
    our total revenue has been slightly higher in the third fiscal
    quarter, with greater sales commission expenses also reported in
    this quarter.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our future results of operations are subject to a number of
    risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could
    cause actual results to differ materially from historical and
    current results and from our projections. Important factors
    known to us that could cause such differences include, but are
    not limited to, those discussed below and those contained in the
    “Safe Harbor” statement at the beginning of
    Part I of this

Form 10-K.

We may be adversely impacted by volatility in the
    financial and economic environment:

During
    periods of weakening economic conditions, employment levels may
    decrease and interest rates may become more volatile. These
    conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction
    volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of
    business. Current or potential clients may decide to reduce
    their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services. In
    addition, new business starts may be affected by an inability to
    obtain credit. The interest we earn on funds held for clients
    may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to
    invest and lower interest rates. In addition, during periods of
    volatility in the credit markets, certain types of investments
    may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to
    invest in, further reducing the interest we may earn on client
    funds. Constriction in the credit markets may impact the
    availability of financing, even to borrowers with the highest
    credit ratings. We historically have not borrowed against
    available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs. However,
    should we require additional short-term liquidity during days of
    large outflows of client funds, a credit constriction may limit
    our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain
    them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us. If all of
    these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in
    effect for an extended period of time, there could be a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our interest earned on funds held for clients may be
    impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the
    amount of tax withheld or timing of
    remittance:

We receive interest income from
    investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. A
    change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to
    be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable
    tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest
    income.

Our services may be adversely impacted by changes in
    government regulations and policies:

Many of
    our services, particularly payroll tax administration services
    and employee benefit plan administration services, are designed
    according to government regulations that continue to change.
    Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of
    benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide
    employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and
    employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or
    eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially
    decrease our revenue. Added requirements could also increase our
    cost of doing business. Failure by us to modify our services in
    a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

We may not be able to keep pace with changes in
    technology:

To maintain our growth strategy,
    we must adapt and respond to technological advances and
    technological requirements of our clients. Our future success
    will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase
    the performance of our internal use systems, particularly our
    systems that meet our clients’ requirements. We continue to
    make significant investments related to the development of new
    technology. If our systems become outdated, we may be at a
    disadvantage when competing in our industry. There can be no
    assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will
    be successful. If we do not integrate and update our systems in
    a timely manner, or if our investments in technology fail to
    provide the expected results, there could be a material adverse
    effect to our business and results of operations.

In the event of a catastrophe, our business continuity
    plan may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and
    adversely interrupt operations:

Our
    operations are dependent on our ability to protect our
    infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural
    disaster, unauthorized security breach, power loss,
    telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, or other events
    that could have a significant disruptive effect on our
    operations. We have a



business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure
    due to any of these events. If the business continuity plan is
    unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could
    potentially lose client data or experience material adverse
    interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our
    clients.

We may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party
    service providers to perform their
    functions:

As part of providing services to
    clients, we rely on a number of third-party service providers.
    These service providers include, but are not limited to,
    couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to
    electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees.
    Failure by these service providers, for any reason, to deliver
    their services in a timely manner could result in material
    interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and
    result in significant penalties or liabilities to us.

We may make errors and omissions in providing services,
    which could result in significant penalties and liabilities for
    us:

Processing, tracking, collecting, and
    remitting client funds to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies, client employees, and other third parties are complex
    operations. These tasks could be subject to error and these
    errors could include, but are not limited to, late filing with
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies, underpayment of taxes,
    and failure to comply with applicable banking regulations and
    laws relating to employee benefits administration, which could
    result in significant penalties and liabilities that would
    adversely affect our results of operations. We could also
    transfer funds in error to an incorrect party or for the wrong
    amount, and may be unable to correct the error or recover the
    funds, resulting in a loss to us.

We may experience a loss as the result of our clients
    having insufficient funds to cover payments we have made on
    their behalf to applicable tax or regulatory agencies and
    employees:

As part of the payroll processing
    service, we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from
    their bank accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies. It is possible that we
    would be held liable for such amounts in the event the client
    has insufficient funds to cover them. We have made in the past,
    and may make in the future, payments on our clients’ behalf
    for which we are not reimbursed, resulting in a loss to us.

Our business and reputation may be affected by our ability
    to keep clients’ information
    confidential:

Our business involves the use
    of significant amounts of private and confidential client
    information including employees’ identification numbers,
    bank accounts, and retirement account information. This
    information is critical to the accurate and timely provision of
    services to our clients, and certain information may be
    transmitted via the Internet. There is no guarantee that our
    systems and processes are adequate to protect against all
    security breaches. If our systems are disrupted or fail for any
    reason, or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized
    persons, our clients could experience data loss, financial loss,
    harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. Such
    events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation,
    regulation investigation and penalties, loss of clients’
    business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, and there
    could be a material adverse effect on our business and results
    of operations.

We may be exposed to additional risks related to our
    co-employment relationship within our PEO
    business:

Many federal and state laws that
    apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically
    address the obligations and responsibilities of the
    “co-employment” relationship. As a result, there is a
    possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations
    of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or
    omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our
    agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or
    violations. Although our agreements with the clients provide
    that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable
    to its own or its employees’ conduct, we may not be able to
    effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. In
    addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our
    employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the
    “employer” under any of the state or federal laws.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits from
    acquisitions:

From time to time we acquire
    other companies. The effective integration of acquired companies
    may be difficult to achieve. It is also possible that we may not
    realize any or all expected benefits from acquisitions or
    achieve benefits from acquisitions in a timely manner. In
    addition, we may incur significant costs and management’s
    time and attention may be diverted from other parts of our
    business in connection with the integration of acquisitions.
    Failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could have
    a material adverse effect on our results of operations.



We may have an adverse outcome of legal matters, which
    could harm our business:

We are subject to
    various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course
    of business. These include disputes or potential disputes
    related to breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty,
    employment-related claims, tax claims, and other matters. As of
    May 31, 2009, we have a reserve of $20.4 million for
    pending litigation. Refer to Item 3 of this

Form 10-K

for additional disclosure regarding legal proceedings. In light
    of the litigation reserve recorded, our management currently
    believes that resolution of outstanding legal matters will not
    have a material adverse effect on our financial position or
    results of our operations. However, legal matters are subject to
    inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that
    their ultimate resolution could have a material adverse effect
    on our financial position and results of operations in the
    period in which any such effect is recorded.

    our regional, branch, and sales offices and data processing
    centers. These locations are concentrated in metropolitan areas.
    We believe that adequate, suitable lease space will continue to
    be available for our needs.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in
    the normal course of our business. These include disputes or
    potential disputes related to breach of contract, breach of
    fiduciary duty, employment-related claims, tax claims, and other
    matters.

In August 2001, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,
    Rapid Payroll, Inc. (“Rapid Payroll”) informed
    76 licensees that it intended to stop supporting their
    payroll processing software in August of 2002. Thereafter,
    lawsuits were commenced by licensees asserting various claims,
    including breach of contract and related tort and fraud causes
    of action. As previously reported in our prior periodic reports,
    these lawsuits sought compensatory damages, punitive damages,
    and injunctive relief against Rapid Payroll, the Company, our
    former Chief Executive Officer, and our former Senior Vice
    President of Sales and Marketing. In accordance with our
    indemnification agreements with our senior executives, the
    Company has agreed to defend and, if necessary, indemnify them
    in connection with these pending matters.



At the present time, the Company has fully resolved its
    licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with
    75 of the 76 licensees who were provided services by Rapid
    Payroll. In 2007, a verdict was issued in the

Brunskill
    Associates, Inc. v. Rapid Payroll, Inc. et al

. case,
    which was pending in California Superior Court, Los Angeles
    County, in which a jury awarded to the plaintiff
    $15.0 million in compensatory damages and subsequently
    awarded an additional $11.0 million in punitive damages.
    The Company is pursuing an appeal of that verdict. Any final
    judgment could be subject to an award of statutory interest.

We have a reserve for pending litigation matters. The litigation
    reserve has been adjusted in fiscal 2009 for settlements and
    incurred litigation expenditures. Our reserve for all pending
    litigation totaled $20.4 million as of May 31, 2009,
    and is included in current liabilities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

In light of the reserve for all pending litigation matters, our
    management currently believes that resolution of outstanding
    legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position or results of operations. However, legal
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists
    the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters
    could have a material adverse impact on our financial position
    and results of operations in the period in which any such effect
    is recorded.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

    the solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the three
    months ended May 31, 2009.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under
    the symbol “PAYX.” Dividends have historically been

    The level and continuation of future dividends are dependent on
    our future earnings and cash flows, and are subject to the
    discretion of the Board of Directors.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations reviews the operating results of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“we,”
    “our,” or “us”) for each of the three fiscal
    years ended May 31, 2009 (“fiscal 2009”),
    May 31, 2008 (“fiscal 2008”), and May 31,
    2007 (“fiscal 2007”), and our financial condition as
    of May 31, 2009. This review should be read in conjunction
    with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the
    related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Form 10-K”)

and the “Risk Factors” discussed in Item 1A of
    this

Form 10-K.

Forward-looking statements in this review are qualified by the
    cautionary statement under the heading “Safe Harbor
    Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995” contained at the beginning of Part I of this

Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a leading provider of payroll, human resource, and
    benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized
    businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a
    portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to
    meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs.

Our Payroll services are provided through either our core
    payroll or Major Market Services (“MMS”), which is
    utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and
    benefits needs, and include:

•

payroll processing;

•

payroll tax administration services;

•

employee payment services; and

•

regulatory compliance services (new-hire reporting and
    garnishment processing).

In addition to the above, our software-as-a-service solution
    through the MMS platform provides human resource management,
    employee benefits management, a time and attendance solution,
    online expense reporting, and applicant tracking.



Our Human Resource Services primarily include:

•

comprehensive human resource outsourcing services, which include
    Paychex
    Premier

®

Human Resources and our Professional Employer Organization
    (“PEO”);

•

retirement services administration;

•

health and benefits services;

•

workers’ compensation insurance services;

•

time and attendance solutions; and

•

other human resource services and products.

We mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services
    performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of
    clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and
    utilization of ancillary services. We also earn interest on
    funds held for clients between the time of collection from our
    clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. Our strategy is focused on
    achieving strong long-term financial performance while providing
    high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services; growing
    our client base; increasing utilization of our ancillary
    services; leveraging our technological and operating
    infrastructure; and expanding our service offerings.

Our financial results for fiscal 2009 were affected by weak
    economic conditions in the United States (“U.S.”), the
    severe credit crisis in the financial markets, and extremely low
    investment rates of return on our funds held for clients. The
    weak economy affects our ability to sell and retain clients,
    reduces our transaction volumes related to fewer employees in
    our client base, and results in lower average invested balances
    in our funds held for clients. The impacts were reflected in
    many of our key indicators, with the most significant
    deterioration occurring in the three months ending May 31,
    2009 (the “fourth quarter”), as follows:

•

Checks per client decreased 5.2% for the fourth quarter and 2.9%
    for fiscal 2009, and are projected to decline 3% for the year
    ending May 31, 2010 (“fiscal 2010”);

•

New client sales from new business starts declined 27% for the
    fourth quarter and 19% for fiscal 2009;

•

Clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer
    having any employees increased 19% for the fourth quarter and
    17% for fiscal 2009;

•

Average rate of return earned on our combined investment
    portfolios was 2.1% for fiscal 2009 compared to 3.7% for fiscal
    2008; and

•

Short-term taxable average interest rate earned was 1.2% for
    fiscal 2009 compared to 4.2% for fiscal 2008.

Despite the economic pressures, we achieved service revenue
    growth of 4% over the prior fiscal year as a result of our
    annual price increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary
    payroll and Human Resource Services. We effectively managed our
    expenses as operating income, net of certain items, increased 5%
    and improved as a percentage of service revenue to 36.4% for
    fiscal 2009 as compared to 36.0% for fiscal 2008. Refer to the
    discussion below for further information on operating income,
    net of certain items.

Our financial results for fiscal 2009 included the following
    highlights:

•

Payroll service revenue increased 1% to $1.5 billion.

•

Human Resource Services revenue increased 11% to
    $523.6 million.

•

Total revenue increased 1% to $2.1 billion.

•

Operating income decreased 3% to $805.2 million, as
    combined interest on funds held for clients and investment
    income decreased 48%.

•

Operating income, net of certain items, increased 5% to
    $729.7 million.

•

Net income decreased 7% to $533.5 million.



•

Diluted earnings per share decreased 5% to $1.48 per share.

•

Cash flow from operations decreased 5% to $688.8 million.

•

Dividends of $447.7 million were paid to stockholders,
    representing 84% of net income.

In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) measure, we
    present operating income, net of certain items, which is a
    non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain
    items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an
    indicator of our core business operations performance period
    over period. It is also the measure used internally for
    establishing the following year’s targets and measuring
    management’s performance in connection with certain
    performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating
    income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held
    for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to increase
    the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an
    adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest
    rates, which are not within the control of management. The
    expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an
    adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent
    nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and
    obscures the comparability of performance period over period.
    Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated
    through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of
    disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”). As such, it should not be considered as a
    substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and,
    therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction
    with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may
    produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be
    comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other
    companies. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 5%
    to $729.7 million for fiscal 2009 compared to
    $696.5 million for fiscal 2008 and $605.4 million for
    fiscal 2007.

Although we have been operating in an unprecedented economic
    environment during fiscal 2009, we maintained stability in our
    employee base, allowing us to continue to focus on providing
    excellent customer service and invest in our business. Some of
    these investments include the following:

Client base and increased utilization of ancillary
    services:

Our client base was approximately
    554,000 clients as of May 31, 2009. This compares with
    approximately 572,000 clients as of May 31, 2008, and
    approximately 561,000 clients as of May 31, 2007. Our
    client base declined 3.1% for fiscal 2009, compared to growth of
    2.0% for fiscal 2008 and growth of 3.3% for fiscal 2007. The
    reduction in our client base for fiscal 2009 reflects the impact
    of weaker economic conditions on our ability to attract and
    retain clients. New client sales from new business starts
    decreased 19% for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. Also,
    an increase of 17% in clients lost due to companies going out of
    business or no longer having any employees impacted our client
    retention, which was slightly below historical levels at
    approximately 77% of our beginning of the fiscal year client
    base.

Despite the challenging selling environment resulting from the
    weak economy, we added over 111,000 new clients during fiscal
    2009. New sales revenue for MMS clients was strong for fiscal
    2009, increasing just under 20% compared to fiscal 2008. The
    market for MMS has not been as severely impacted by the decline
    in new business starts.

We believe growth opportunities continue to exist in our target
    market of small- to medium-sized businesses. Accordingly, we
    continue to increase the size of our sales force in key areas,
    primarily MMS and health and benefits services. Reductions are
    expected in certain areas of our Human Resource Services sales
    force due to deceleration



in client bases and aggressive sales force increases in prior
    periods. The following table summarizes the expected composition
    of our sales force in fiscal 2010 with comparisons to fiscal
    2009 and 2008:

There are also opportunities for growth within our current
    client base, as well as with new clients, through increased
    penetration of our payroll and human resource ancillary services
    and products. Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll
    processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating
    margin. The following statistics demonstrate the growth in our

Service and product initiatives:

During
    fiscal 2009, we made investments in the ongoing expansion of our
    portfolio of services and products. These included strengthening
    our software-as-a-service solution for our MMS clients through
    the following:

•

Enhanced the Paychex Time and Labor Online product, an
    Internet-based, integrated time and labor management system that
    provides clients with an easy and cost-effective way to automate
    time and attendance processes.

•

Introduced Paychex Expense Manager, an integrated payroll and
    expense management solution to help clients control
    discretionary spending while giving their employees the
    convenience of preparing and submitting expense reports via an
    easy-to-use, secure, online tool.

In addition, other fiscal 2009 initiatives included the
    following:

•

Enhanced our 401(k) product through the addition of auto
    enrollment as an optional plan feature. This feature allows
    employers to automatically enroll their employees in their
    company’s 401(k) plan and increase overall plan
    participation.

•

Continued expansion of our health insurance services nationwide,
    simplifying the process for our clients to obtain coverage
    through our network of national and regional insurers. Revenue
    from health and benefits services increased 70% to
    $20.9 million for fiscal 2009, and is anticipated to exceed
    $30.0 million for fiscal 2010.

•

Made necessary adjustments to proactively respond to provisions
    under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the
    “2009 economic stimulus package”), particularly the
    “Making Work Pay” income tax credit and premium
    assistance for COBRA recipients. Our preparedness allowed us to
    educate and assist our clients with these regulatory changes.



Business acquisitions:

We may
    supplement our growth from time to time through strategic
    acquisitions when opportunities arise. In fiscal 2009, we made
    immaterial acquisitions to supplement our payroll client base.

Focus on customer service:

Integral to
    our strategy is satisfied customers to achieve maximum client
    retention. For fiscal 2009, we received high client satisfaction
    results which was encouraging considering the economic pressures
    our clients are facing. Client retention was approximately 77%
    of our beginning of the fiscal year client base. Although
    customer satisfaction remained strong, increases in clients
    going out of business or no longer having any employees, and
    pricing pressures from our largest direct competitor and
    regional payroll providers kept our client retention rate
    slightly below historical levels.

Financial position and liquidity:

The
    current credit crisis has resulted in unprecedented volatility
    in the global financial markets, with diminished liquidity and
    increased exposure to investment losses occurring in these
    markets. Despite this macroeconomic environment, as of
    May 31, 2009, our financial position remained strong with
    cash and total corporate investments of $574.7 million and
    no debt. Our cash and total corporate investments have increased
    approximately $140 million since May 31, 2008.

We also believe that our investments as of May 31, 2009
    were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date
    that would indicate any

other-than-temporary

impairment. We maintain a conservative investment strategy
    within our investment portfolios to maximize liquidity and
    protect principal. In the current financial markets, this
    translates to significantly lower yields on high quality
    instruments, negatively impacting our income earned on funds
    held for clients and corporate investments. Our exposure has
    been minimized in the current investment environment as the
    result of our policies of investing primarily in high credit
    quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term
    securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings, and by limiting the amounts that can be invested in any
    single issuer. All investments held as of May 31, 2009 are
    traded in active markets.

As of May 31, 2009, we had no exposure to variable rate
    demand notes (“VRDNs”) or prime money market funds. In
    September 2008, we sold all of our holdings in these types of
    investments as a result of turmoil in the related markets. No
    losses were recognized on these sales. The proceeds from the
    sale of these investments were reinvested in U.S. agency
    discount notes, which is our current primary short-term
    investment vehicle. We have no exposure to auction rate
    securities,

sub-prime

mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed
    commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash
    or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles
    (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial
    instruments to manage interest rate risk.

Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow
    from operations was $688.8 million for fiscal 2009.
    Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases,
    and dividend payments from our operating activities. It is
    anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of
    May 31, 2009, along with projected operating cash flows,
    will support our normal business operations, capital purchases,
    and dividend payments for the foreseeable future. During fiscal
    2009, dividends paid to stockholders were 84% of net income.

For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal
    years 2009, 2008, and 2007, and our financial position as of
    May 31, 2009, refer to the tables and analysis in the
    “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and
    Capital Resources” sections of this Item 7 and the
    discussion in the “Critical Accounting Policies”
    section of this Item 7.



Outlook

Our current outlook for fiscal 2010 is based upon current
    economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no
    significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding
    guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on
    future changes to interest rates. Comparisons to fiscal 2009
    quarters are expected to improve as fiscal 2010 progresses.
    Projected changes in revenue and net income for fiscal 2010 are
    as follows:

Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of
    service revenue is expected to range from 34% to 35% for fiscal
    2010. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate
    35% for fiscal 2010. The higher tax rate for fiscal 2010 is
    driven by higher state income tax rates resulting from state
    legislative changes.

Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for
    fiscal 2010 are expected to be impacted by interest rate
    volatility. Interest on funds held for clients will be further
    impacted by a projected 5% decline in average invested balances,
    with most of the effect in the first half of fiscal 2010. This
    decline is largely the result of the 2009 economic stimulus
    package generating lower tax withholdings for client employees.
    The Federal Funds rate dropped significantly in fiscal 2009 from
    2.00% as of May 31, 2008 to a range of zero to 0.25% as of
    May 31, 2009. As of May 31, 2009, the long-term
    investment portfolio had an average

yield-to-maturity

of 3.3% and an average duration of 2.5 years. In the next
    twelve months, slightly less than 20% of this portfolio will
    mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will
    be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately
    1.40%. Based upon current interest rate and economic conditions,
    we expect interest on funds held for clients and investment
    income to (decrease)/increase by the following amounts in the
    respective quarters of fiscal 2010:

Interest on funds held

Investment income,

Fiscal 2010

for clients

First quarter

(45)%

(70)%

Second quarter

(35)%

(40)%

Third quarter

(20)%

10%

Fourth quarter

(15)%

50%

Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to our
    earnings from a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in
    short-term interest rates would be approximately
    $3.5 million, after taxes, for a twelve-month period. Such
    a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the
    Federal Funds rate. We estimate the lowest level of combined
    interest on funds held for clients and investment income over
    the next fiscal year would be approximately $55 million.

Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2010 are expected
    to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million.
    Fiscal 2010 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range
    of $65 million to $70 million, and we project
    amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2010 to be in the
    range of $20 million to $25 million.

Payroll service revenue:

Payroll
    service revenue increased 1% to $1.5 billion for fiscal
    2009 due to our annual price increase and growth in utilization
    of our ancillary payroll services. Payroll service revenue
    increased 8% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2008 due to client
    base growth, higher check volume, our annual price increase, and
    growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services. The
    weakening economic conditions in fiscal 2009 negatively impacted
    payroll service revenue. During fiscal 2009, our client base
    declined 3.1%, affected by a decline in new client sales from
    new business starts and clients lost due to companies going out
    of business or no longer having any employees. Also, checks per
    client declined 2.9%.

As of May 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, 93% of clients utilized
    our payroll tax administration services. Our employee payment
    services were utilized by 75% of our clients as of May 31,
    2009, compared with 73% as of May 31, 2008 and 71% as of
    May 31, 2007. Nearly all new clients purchase our payroll
    tax administration services and more than 80% of new clients
    select a form of our employee payment services.

Human Resource Services revenue:

Human
    Resource Services revenue increased 11% for fiscal 2009 and 19%
    for fiscal 2008 to $523.6 million and $471.8 million,
    respectively. The following factors contributed to Human

While the above factors contributed to the revenue growth as
    compared to the same period last year, the rate of growth has
    been adversely impacted by weak economic conditions. The
    volatility in the financial markets has caused the asset value
    of retirement services client employees’ funds to decline
    12% to $8.5 billion as of May 31, 2009 as compared to
    the same period last year. The S&P 500 declined 34% during
    the same period. The decline in asset value and a shift in
    client employees’ retirement portfolios to investments
    earning lower fees from external fund managers reduced
    retirement services revenue growth by $8.9 million for
    fiscal 2009. Comprehensive human resource outsourcing services
    revenue growth was adversely impacted by fewer employees per
    client, decreasing revenue by $8.7 million for fiscal 2009.
    The estimated growth in Human Resource Services revenue for
    fiscal 2009 would have been 15% exclusive of these two items. We
    also continue to experience volatility in PEO net service
    revenue due to fluctuations in workers’ compensation claims
    and adjustments to workers’ compensation rates in



Florida. Offsetting some of the above revenue declines was
    $12.4 million of retirement services billings for client
    plan restatements during fiscal 2009 that are required by law
    approximately every ten years.

Total service revenue:

Total service
    revenue growth was 4% for fiscal 2009 and 10% for fiscal 2008.
    The weak economy had a negative impact on service revenue growth
    for fiscal 2009. Refer to the discussion of key indicators in
    the “Overview” section of this Item 7.

Interest on funds held for clients:

The
    decrease in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008 was the result of lower average interest
    rates earned, lower average investment balances, and lower
    realized gains on sales of

available-for-sale

securities. Interest on funds held for clients decreased in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of lower average
    interest rates earned offset by higher average investment
    balances and higher realized gains on sales of

available-for-sale

securities. Overall economic factors, which have negatively
    impacted our client base, have resulted in a decrease of 3% in
    our average investment balances for fiscal 2009. Average
    investment balances for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, which
    deteriorated 9%, were also impacted by the 2009 economic
    stimulus package generating lower tax withholdings for client
    employees. Refer to the “Market Risk Factors” section,
    contained in Item 7A of this

Form 10-K,

for more information on changing interest rates.

During fiscal 2007, we recorded an expense charge of
    $38.0 million to increase our litigation reserve to account
    for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to pending
    legal matters. Refer to Note N of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for additional information on pending legal matters.

Excluding the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve,
    combined operating and SG&A expenses increased 3% for
    fiscal 2009 and 8% for fiscal 2008. This was primarily the
    result of increases in personnel, though at a slower pace than
    prior years, and other costs related to selling and retaining
    clients, and promoting new services. The lower growth rates in
    compensation-related expenses for fiscal 2009 are a result of
    lower bonus and commission expenses attributed to the more
    challenging selling environment given the weak economic
    conditions and the slower pace of new hires. As of May 31,
    2009, we had approximately 12,500 employees compared with
    approximately 12,200 as of May 31, 2008 and 11,700 as of
    May 31, 2007.

Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings,
    furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software.
    Increases in depreciation expense were due to capital
    expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow
    our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily
    related to client list acquisitions, which are amortized using
    either straight-line or accelerated methods. The increases in
    amortization are a result of intangibles from acquisitions and
    client list acquisitions. Other expenses include items such as
    delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and
    entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred
    to support our business.



Operating income:

Operating income
    declined 3% for fiscal 2009 as compared to growth of 18% for
    fiscal 2008. The fluctuations in operating income were
    attributable to the factors previously discussed.

Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on
    funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to
    increase the litigation reserve. Refer to the previous
    discussion of operating income, net of certain items, in the
    “Overview” section of this Item 7. Operating
    income, net of certain items, is as follows for the year ended
    May 31:

Investment income, net:

Investment
    income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and
    cash equivalents and investments in

available-for-sale

securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds
    held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The
    decrease in investment income for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal
    2008 was the result of lower average interest rates earned and
    lower average investment balances. The decrease in investment
    income for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily
    due to lower average investment balances. The lower average
    investment balances in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were a
    result of funding the stock repurchase program which was
    completed in December 2007.

Income taxes:

Our effective income tax
    rate was 34.3% for fiscal 2009, compared with 32.6% for fiscal
    2008, and 30.7% for fiscal 2007. The increases in our effective
    income tax rate for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were primarily
    the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income, derived from
    municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and
    corporate investment portfolios. The increase for fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007 was impacted by a higher effective state
    income tax rate as a result of the adoption of Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109.” Refer to Note J of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K,

for additional disclosures on income taxes.

Net income and earnings per share:

Net
    income declined 7% for fiscal 2009, decreasing to
    $533.5 million, as compared to a net income growth of 12%
    to $576.1 million for fiscal 2008. These fluctuations were
    attributable to the factors previously discussed. In particular,
    for fiscal 2009, combined interest on funds held for clients and
    investment income decreased 48%, or $76.0 million. Net
    income growth for fiscal 2008 was impacted by the increase to
    the litigation reserve of $38.0 million recognized in
    fiscal 2007.

Diluted earnings per share decreased 5% for fiscal 2009 to $1.48
    per share as compared to a 16% increase for fiscal 2008 to $1.56
    per share. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2008 increased
    at a rate higher than net income growth and for fiscal 2009
    decreased at a rate lower than the decrease in net income due to
    a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding resulting
    from the stock repurchase program completed in December 2007. In
    fiscal 2009, the decline in combined interest on funds held for
    clients and investment income noted above impacted diluted
    earnings per share by $0.14 per share.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The current credit crisis has resulted in unprecedented
    volatility in the global financial markets, with diminished
    liquidity and increased exposure to investment losses occurring
    in these markets. Despite this macroeconomic environment, as of
    May 31, 2009, our financial position remained strong as we
    had $574.7 million in cash and total corporate investments
    and no debt. We also believe that our investments as of
    May 31, 2009 were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date
    that would indicate any

other-than-temporary

impairment. Cash and total corporate investments as of
    May 31, 2009, along with projected



operating cash flows, are expected to support our normal
    business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments
    for the foreseeable future.

Commitments
    and Contractual Obligations

Lines of credit:

As of May 31,
    2009, we had unused borrowing capacity available under four
    uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market rates
    of interest with financial institutions as follows:

February 2010

Our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are
    secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between
    Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the
    “Lenders”), pursuant to which we have granted each of
    the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment
    securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
    custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and
    is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the
    Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may
    require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account
    into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual
    Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
    short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
    overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from
    electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the
    ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were
    outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2009 or
    as of May 31, 2009.

JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. are also
    parties to our credit facility and irrevocable standby letters
    of credit, which arrangements are discussed below.

Credit facility:

We have a committed,
    secured, one-year revolving credit facility, expiring on
    September 20, 2009. This credit facility was available to
    extend the duration of our long-term investment portfolio. We
    have not used the credit facility during fiscal 2009 or as of
    May 31, 2009, and we do not have plans for it in the
    future. The credit facility is collateralized by the long-term
    securities of Paychex of New York LLC (the
    “Borrower”), to the extent of any borrowing. Under the
    credit facility the Borrower may, subject to certain
    restrictions, borrow up to $400 million to meet short-term
    funding requirements on client fund obligations. Upon expiration
    of the commitment in September 2009, any borrowings outstanding
    will mature and be payable on such date.

The revolving loans under the credit facility will bear interest
    at competitive rates to be elected by the Borrower. The Borrower
    will also pay a facility fee at a rate of .05% per annum on the
    average daily unused amount of the commitment. Refer to
    Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for further discussion of the credit facility.

Letters of credit:

As of May 31,
    2009, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding
    totaling $65.8 million, required to secure commitments for
    certain of our insurance policies and bonding requirements.
    These letters of credit expire at various dates between December
    2009 and December 2012 and are collateralized by securities held
    in our investment portfolios. No amounts were outstanding on
    these letters of credit during fiscal 2009 or as of May 31,
    2009.



Other commitments:

We have entered into
    various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under
    GAAP, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    May 31, 2009. The table below summarizes our estimated
    annual payment obligations under these commitments, as well as
    other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2009:

Advantage has license agreements with independently owned
    associate offices (“Associates”), which are
    responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services
    and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex,
    Inc. and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll
    processing and payroll tax administration services. Under these
    arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates commissions based on
    processing activity for the related clients. When we acquired
    Advantage, there were fifteen Associates. As of May 31,
    2009, we have ten Associates. Since the actual amounts of future
    payments are uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are
    not included in the table above. Commission expense for the
    Associates for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 was
    $12.3 million, and $15.3 million, and
    $15.2 million respectively.

We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance
    contracts for clients who financed their service contracts
    through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make
    representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of
    services under service arrangements with clients. In addition,
    we have entered into indemnification agreements with our
    officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if
    necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or
    future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to
    us. Historically, there have been no material losses related to
    such guarantees and indemnifications.

We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various
    insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans.
    Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements
    is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been
    material. We also



maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary
    insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices
    liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, and acts of
    terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured
    retentions through our captive insurance company.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in
    transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special
    purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would
    have been established for the purpose of facilitating
    off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do
    maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing
    projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations.
    These investments are accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting and are less than 1% of our total assets as of
    May 31, 2009.

Reclassification
    Within Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

Client fund obligations represent our contractual obligation to
    remit funds to satisfy clients’ payroll and tax payment
    obligations. To better reflect the nature of these activities,
    in fiscal 2008 we reclassified the net change in client fund
    obligations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from
    investing activities to financing activities for all periods
    presented. This reclassification had no impact on the net change
    in cash and cash equivalents or cash flows from operating
    activities for any periods presented. Refer to Note B to
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for more information on this reclassification.

The decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 is
    attributable to lower net income. The increase in operating cash
    flows for fiscal 2008 reflects higher net income adjusted for
    non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
    The increase in non-cash adjustments to net income in fiscal
    2009 is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization on
    property and equipment and intangible assets. The decrease in
    non-cash adjustments to net income for fiscal 2008 was primarily
    attributable to the expense charge of $38.0 million to
    increase the litigation reserve in fiscal 2007, offset by an
    increase in the provision for deferred income taxes. The
    fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between
    periods were primarily related to lower interest receivable
    balances and the timing of collection and payments for
    compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.

Funds held for clients and corporate
    investments:

Funds held for clients consist
    of short-term funds and

available-for-sale

securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of

available-for-sale

securities. The



portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is
    detailed in Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate
    investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases,
    sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of funds held
    for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client
    funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or
    regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and
    to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services.
    During fiscal 2008, proceeds from sales and maturities of

available-for-sale

securities were not reinvested as a result of the
    $1.0 billion stock repurchase program completed in December
    2007. In fiscal 2009, with the volatility in the financial
    markets, funds previously invested in certain

available-for-sale

securities were reinvested in cash equivalents. Additional
    discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in
    the “Market Risk Factors” section, contained in
    Item 7A of this

Form 10-K.

Purchases of long-lived assets:

To
    support our continued client and ancillary product growth,
    purchases of property and equipment were made for data
    processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and
    upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal 2009,
    fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2007, we purchased approximately
    $4.5 million, $4.4 million, and $2.8 million,
    respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC
    Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive
    Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board of Directors
    (the “Board”).

Construction in progress totaled $4.0 million and
    $52.1 million as of May 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Of these costs, $3.4 million and
    $51.6 million represent software being developed for
    internal use as of May 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for
    its intended use, at which time we begin amortization of the
    costs. During the last three months of fiscal 2009, a
    significant portion of the internal use software costs
    previously in construction in progress were placed in service.
    These internal use software costs are being amortized over
    fifteen years, at a rate of approximately $4.0 million
    annually.

During fiscal 2009, we paid $6.4 million related to
    acquisitions of businesses, compared with $32.9 million and
    $3.1 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    acquisitions in fiscal 2008 related mainly to employee benefits
    products. The purchases of other assets were for customer lists.

Net change in client fund
    obligations:

The client fund obligations
    liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client
    funds, and the related required remittance of funds to
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax
    administration services and to employees of clients utilizing
    employee payment services. Collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days.

Repurchases of common stock:

We
    repurchased 23.7 million shares of common stock for a total
    of $1.0 billion under our stock repurchase program
    completed in December 2007.

Dividends paid:

In July 2008, our Board
    approved a 3% increase in our quarterly dividend payment to
    $0.31 per share from $0.30 per share. In July 2007, our Board
    approved an increase of 43% in the quarterly dividend payment to
    $0.30 per share from $0.21 per share. The dividends paid as a
    percentage of net income totaled 84%,



77%, and 58% for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2007,
    respectively. The payment of future dividends is dependent on
    our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the
    discretion of our Board.

Exercise of stock options:

Proceeds
    from and excess tax benefit related to exercise of stock options
    decreased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, and
    increased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Common
    shares acquired through exercise of stock options for fiscal
    2009 were 0.4 million shares compared with 2.0 million
    shares for fiscal 2008 and 1.8 million shares for fiscal
    2007. Refer to Note C to the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for additional disclosures on our stock-based compensation plans.

Other

New accounting pronouncements:

In
    December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141 (revised 2007)
    (“SFAS No. 141R”), “Business
    Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R provides guidance on
    how an entity will recognize and measure the identifiable assets
    acquired (including goodwill), liabilities assumed, and
    noncontrolling interests, if any, acquired in a business
    combination. SFAS No. 141R further requires that
    acquisition-related costs and costs associated with
    restructuring or exiting activities of an acquired entity will
    be expensed as incurred. SFAS No. 141R will impact
    business combinations that may be completed on or after
    June 1, 2009. We cannot anticipate whether the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141R will have a material effect on our
    results of operations or financial position as the impact is
    solely dependent on whether we enter into any business
    combination, and the terms of such transactions.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. FAS 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets.” This FSP amends the factors that should be
    considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used
    to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset
    under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.” The intent is to improve the
    consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible
    asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected
    cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under
    SFAS No. 141R and other U.S. GAAP. This standard
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and is applicable to our fiscal year beginning
    June 1, 2009. We do not expect that the adoption of this
    FSP will have an effect on our results of operations or
    financial condition.

In April 2009, the FASB issued the following three staff
    positions intended to provide additional accounting guidance and
    enhance disclosures regarding fair value measurements and
    impairments of debt securities:

•

FSP No. FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1,

“Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments,” requiring publicly traded companies to
    disclose the fair value of financial instruments in interim
    financial statements;

•

FSP

No. FAS 157-4,

“Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of
    Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased
    and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly,”
    providing guidance for determining fair value when there is no
    active market or where price inputs being used represent
    distressed sales; and

•

FSP

No. FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2,

“Recognition and Presentation of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairments,” providing guidance for measurement and
    recognition of impaired debt securities along with expanded
    disclosures with respect to impaired debt securities.

These FSPs are effective for interim and annual periods ending
    after June 15, 2009, and are applicable to our fiscal year
    beginning June 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of
    these FSPs will have a material effect on our results of
    operations or financial position.

In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165,
    “Subsequent Events.” This statement establishes
    guidance related to accounting for and disclosure of events that
    happen after the date of the balance sheet but before the
    release of the financial statements. SFAS No. 165 is
    effective for reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009,
    and is applicable to our fiscal year beginning June 1,
    2009. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a
    material effect on our results of operations or financial
    position.



In June 2009, the FASB issued the following standards:

•

SFAS No. 166, “Accounting for Transfers of
    Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 140;” and

•

SFAS No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation
    No. 46(R).”

Both standards are effective for annual periods beginning after
    November 15, 2009, and are applicable to our fiscal year
    beginning June 1, 2010. We are currently evaluating both
    standards but do not expect their adoption to have a material
    effect on our results of operations or financial position.

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB
    (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American
    Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not,
    or are not expected to have a material effect on our results of
    operations or financial position.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Note A to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex, Inc.
    Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial
    Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that
    affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and
    expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting
    policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical
    experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be
    reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts
    and results could differ from these estimates. Certain
    accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of
    operations or financial position are discussed below.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenue is
    recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
    service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
    or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Certain processing services are provided under annual service
    arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
    service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to
    payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a
    fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per
    processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction
    processed. The revenue earned from delivery service for the
    distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is
    included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are
    included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
    Income.

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net
    of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes,
    benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct
    costs billed and incurred were $2.6 billion for each of
    fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007.

Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized
    when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence that
    an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order;
    delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is
    fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and
    collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are
    generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their
    purchase of certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from
    these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term
    of the contract.

In certain situations we allow a client a right of return or
    refund. We maintain an allowance for returns, which is based on
    historical data. The allowance is reviewed periodically for
    adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in our results
    of operations for the period in which the adjustment is
    identified.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
    that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
    administration services and for employee payment services, and
    invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on
    these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and
    remitting of these funds are critical components of providing
    these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
    net realized gains and losses from the sales of

available-for-sale

securities.



PEO workers’ compensation
    insurance:

Workers’ compensation
    insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated
    costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves
    include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those
    claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain
    expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In
    establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves,
    we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future
    cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
    and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
    actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
    multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal
    liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially
    impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from
    our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not
    occur until well into the future.

We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’
    compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously
    established reserves are reflected in our results of operations
    for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such
    adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
    variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

In fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, workers’ compensation
    insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on
    claims paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims liability
    was $1 million under both the fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008
    policies.

We had recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation claims as of:

Valuation of investments:

Our
    investments in

available-for-sale

securities are reported at fair value. In determining the fair
    value of our available-for-sale securities, we utilize the
    Interactive Data Pricing Service, a market approach. Unrealized
    gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and
    unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value of
    investments are included in comprehensive income, net of tax, as
    reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
    Equity. Changes in the fair value of investments impact our net
    income only when such investments are sold or impairment is
    recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities
    are determined by specific identification of the security’s
    cost basis. On our Consolidated Statements of Income, realized
    gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in
    interest on funds held for clients, whereas realized gains and
    losses from corporate investments are included in investment
    income, net.

We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our

available-for-sale

securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the
    terms of their bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by
    investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA
    and AA ratings, and short-term securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any
    single issuer. We regularly review our investment portfolio to
    determine if any investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential
    valuation concerns, which would require us to record an
    impairment charge in the period any such determination is made.
    In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the
    duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is
    less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit
    rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold
    the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or
    maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not

other-than-temporarily

impaired could change in the future due to new developments or
    changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any
    particular investment.

Goodwill and other intangible
    assets:

We have $433.3 million of
    goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    May 31, 2009, resulting from acquisitions of businesses.
    Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment on
    an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
    circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a
    potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.
    Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including
    goodwill. Our business is



largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the
    goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. We perform our
    annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter. Based on the results
    of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment loss was
    recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2009 or
    fiscal 2008. Subsequent to this review, there have been no
    events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment
    of our goodwill balance.

We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable.

Accrual for client fund losses:

We
    maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our
    clients’ inability to meet their payroll obligations. As
    part of providing payroll, payroll tax administration services,
    and employee payment services, we are authorized by the client
    to initiate money transfers from the client’s bank account
    for the amount of tax obligations and employees’ direct
    deposits. Electronic money fund transfers from client bank
    accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from
    clients’ insufficient funds to cover such transfers. We
    evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and
    analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically
    reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the
    clients.

Contingent liabilities:

We are subject
    to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal
    course of business. As of May 31, 2009, we had
    approximately $20.4 million of reserves for pending
    litigation. Based on the application of SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies,” which requires us to
    record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is
    probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably
    estimated, we deem this amount adequate. The determination of
    whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the
    amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires
    considerable judgment. This reserve may change in the future due
    to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions
    related to any particular matter. In light of the litigation
    reserve recorded, we currently believe that resolution of these
    matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position or results of operations. However, these matters are
    subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the
    possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could
    have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our
    results of operations in the period in which any such effect is
    recorded. For additional information regarding pending legal
    matters, refer to Note N in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Stock-based compensation costs:

In
    accordance with SFAS No. 123R, all stock-based awards
    to employees, including grants of stock options, are recognized
    as compensation costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements
    based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We
    estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various
    assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the
    Paychex stock price and expected option life. We estimate
    volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using
    weekly stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a
    period equal to the expected option life. We estimate expected
    option life based on historical exercise behavior.

Under SFAS No. 123R, we are required to estimate
    forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards
    that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were
    determined based on type of award and historical experience.
    Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a
    significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in
    the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the
    requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in our results of operations.

We have determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
    as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application,
    is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option
    grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our
    choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model
    if additional information becomes available in the future
    indicating that another model would provide a more accurate
    estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants
    would warrant such a change.

Income taxes:

We account for deferred
    taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
    included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax
    returns. Under



this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
    based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
    basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
    effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
    reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to the
    stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain
    stock-based awards. At the time of exercise of non-qualified
    stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards, we account
    for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income
    tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any
    excess tax benefit increasing additional paid-in capital. We
    currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in
    additional paid-in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits
    related to stock-based awards. We also maintain a reserve for
    uncertain tax positions in accordance with FIN 48.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk Factors

Changes in interest rates and interest rate
    risk:

Funds held for clients are primarily
    comprised of short-term funds and

available-for-sale

securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of

available-for-sale

securities. As a result of our operating and investing
    activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may
    materially affect our results of operations and financial
    position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings
    potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in
    the fair value of our longer-term

available-for-sale

securities. We maintain a conservative investment strategy
    within our investment portfolios to maximize liquidity and
    protect principal. We attempt to mitigate the risks associated
    with our investing activities by investing primarily in high
    credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term
    securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings, limiting amounts that can be invested in any single
    issuer, and by investing in short- to intermediate-term
    instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate
    changes. We manage the

available-for-sale

securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three
    years. All investments held as of May 31, 2009 are traded
    in active markets.

As of May 31, 2009, we had no exposure to VRDNs or prime
    money market funds. In September 2008, we sold all of our
    holdings of these types of investments as a result of turmoil in
    the related markets. No losses were recognized on those sales.
    The proceeds from the sales of these investments were reinvested
    in U.S. agency discount notes, which are currently our
    primary short-term investment option. We have no exposure to
    auction rate securities,

sub-prime

mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed
    commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash
    or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles
    (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial
    instruments to manage our interest rate risk.

During fiscal 2009, the average interest rate earned on our
    combined funds held for clients and corporate investment
    portfolios was 2.1% compared with 3.7% for fiscal 2008 and 4.0%
    for fiscal 2007. With the turmoil currently in the financial
    markets, our conservative investment strategy translates to
    significantly lower yields on high quality instruments. When
    interest rates are falling, the full impact of lower interest
    rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the
    interaction of short- and long-term interest rate changes.
    During a falling interest rate environment, the decreases in
    interest rates decrease earnings from our short-term
    investments, and over time decrease earnings from our
    longer-term

available-for-sale

securities. Earnings from

available-for-sale

securities, which as of May 31, 2009 had an average
    duration of two and one-half years, would not reflect decreases
    in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and
    the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates. In the next twelve
    months, slightly less than 20% of our

available-for-sale

portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that
    these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest
    rate of approximately 1.40%.



The cost and fair value of

available-for-sale

securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2009
    are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can
    differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have
    the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

The Federal Funds rate was a range of zero to 0.25% as of
    May 31, 2009.

Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates
    involves many factors. These factors include, but are not
    limited to:

•

daily interest rate changes;

•

seasonal variations in investment balances;

•

actual duration of short-term and

available-for-sale

securities;

•

the proportional mix of taxable and tax-exempt investments;

•

changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment
    rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous; and

•

financial market volatility and the resulting effect on
    benchmark and other indexing interest rates.

Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change in taxable
    interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates
    by approximately 17 basis points.

Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and
    corporate investments) averaged approximately $3.9 billion
    for fiscal 2009. Our anticipated allocation is approximately 50%
    invested in short-term securities and

available-for-sale

securities with an average duration of less than 30 days,
    and 50% invested in

available-for-sale

securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three
    years.

The combined funds held for clients and corporate

available-for-sale

securities reflected a net unrealized gain of $66.7 million
    as of May 31, 2009, compared with a net unrealized gain of
    $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008. During fiscal 2009,
    the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of
    $15.2 million to a net unrealized gain of
    $86.6 million. During fiscal 2008, the investment
    portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of



$24.3 million to a net unrealized gain of
    $48.7 million. The net unrealized gain of our investment
    portfolios was approximately $72.7 million as of
    July 10, 2009.

As of May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, we had
    $1.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, invested
    in

available-for-sale

securities at fair value. The weighted-average

yield-to-maturity

was 3.3% and 3.4%, as of May 31, 2009 and May 31,
    2008, respectively. The weighted-average

yield-to-maturity

excludes

available-for-sale

securities tied to short-term interest rates such as the VRDNs
    held as of May 31, 2008. We held no VRDNs as of
    May 31, 2009. Assuming a hypothetical decrease in both
    short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis
    points, the resulting potential increase in fair value for our
    portfolio of

available-for-sale

securities as of May 31, 2009, would be approximately $11.0
    million. Conversely, a corresponding increase in interest rates
    would result in a comparable decrease in fair value. This
    hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the
    portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the
    portfolio’s recorded value, with an offsetting amount
    recorded in stockholders’ equity. These fluctuations in
    fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the
    results of operations, unless any declines in fair value were
    considered to be

other-than-temporary

and an impairment loss recognized.

Credit risk:

We are exposed to credit
    risk in connection with these investments through the possible
    inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We
    attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high
    credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term
    securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any
    single issuer.

We regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if
    any investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential
    valuation concerns. We believe that the investments we held as
    of May 31, 2009 were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired. While certain

available-for-sale

securities had fair values that were below cost, we believe that
    it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected
    in accordance with the contractual terms, and that the decline
    in the fair value was due to changes in interest rates and was
    not due to increased credit risk. As of May 31, 2009 and
    May 31, 2008, the majority of the securities with an
    unrealized loss held an AA rating or better. We have the ability
    and intent to hold these investments until the earlier of market
    price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is
    not

other-than-temporarily

impaired could change in the future due to new developments or
    changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any
    particular investment.

REPORT ON
    MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Paychex, Inc. (the “Company”) is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system
    of internal control over financial reporting as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Our internal control over
    financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits
    and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
    guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified
    personnel, and a written Code of Business Ethics and Conduct
    adopted by our Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to
    all Company Directors and all officers and employees of our
    Company.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
    even when determined to be effective, can only provide
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

The Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors
    meets with the independent public accountants, management, and
    internal auditors periodically to discuss internal control over
    financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting
    matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent public
    accountants the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit
    Committee also meets periodically with the independent public
    accountants and the chief internal auditor without management
    present to ensure that the independent public accountants and
    the chief internal auditor have free access to the Audit
    Committee. The Audit Committee’s Report can be found in the
    Definitive Proxy Statement to be issued in connection with the
    Company’s 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
    2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
    set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission in “Internal Control —

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors

and the Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Paychex, Inc. as of May 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(1). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
    Paychex, Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Paychex, Inc. at May 31, 2009 and
    2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Paychex, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of May 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated July 10, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors

and the Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited Paychex Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    Paychex Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on
    Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Paychex, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of May 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2009 and 2008,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended May 31, 2009 of Paychex, Inc.,
    and our report dated July 10, 2009, expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES
    TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A —

Description
    of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Paychex, Inc.
    and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company” or
    “Paychex”) is a leading provider of payroll, human
    resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to
    medium-sized businesses in the United States (“U.S.”).
    The Company also has a subsidiary in Germany.

Paychex, a Delaware corporation formed in 1979, reports as one
    segment. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is
    generated within the U.S. The Company also generates
    revenue within Germany, which was less than one percent of its
    total revenue for each of the years ended May 31, 2009
    (“fiscal 2009”), 2008 (“fiscal 2008”), and
    2007 (“fiscal 2007”). Long-lived assets in Germany are
    insignificant in relation to total long-lived assets of the
    Company as of May 31, 2009.

Total revenue is comprised of service revenue and interest on
    funds held for clients. Service revenue is comprised of the
    Payroll and Human Resource Services portfolios of services and
    products. Payroll service revenue is earned primarily from
    payroll processing, payroll tax administration services,
    employee payment services, and other ancillary services. Payroll
    processing services include the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; preparation of
    federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
    and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations.

In connection with the automated payroll tax administration
    services, the Company electronically collects payroll taxes from
    clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepares and
    files the applicable tax returns, and remits taxes to the
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due
    dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and
    30 days after receipt, with some items extending to
    90 days. The Company handles regulatory correspondence,
    amendments, and penalty and interest disputes, and is subject to
    cash penalties imposed by tax or regulatory agencies for late
    filings and late or under payment of taxes. With employee
    payment services, employers are offered the option of paying
    their employees by direct deposit, Chase Pay Card

Plus

, a
    check drawn on a Paychex account
    (Readychex

®

),

    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by Paychex. For the first three methods,
    net payroll is collected electronically from the clients’
    bank account, typically one day before payday, and provides
    payment to the employee on payday.

In addition to service fees paid by clients, the Company earns
    interest on funds held for clients that are collected before due
    dates and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or
    regulatory agencies or client employees. The funds held for
    clients and related client fund obligations are included in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as current assets and current
    liabilities. The amount of funds held for clients and related
    client fund obligations varies significantly during the year.

The Human Resource Services portfolio of services and products
    provides small- to medium-sized businesses with retirement
    services administration, health and benefit services,
    workers’ compensation insurance services, time and
    attendance solutions, and other human resource services and
    products. The Company’s Paychex
    Premier

®

Human Resources (“Paychex Premier”) provides a
    combined package of services that include payroll, employer
    compliance, human resource and employee benefits administration,
    risk management outsourcing, and the

on-site

availability of a professionally trained human resource services
    representative. This comprehensive bundle of services is
    designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
    payroll and related benefits costs while providing a benefits
    package equal to that of larger companies. The Company also
    operates a Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”),
    which provides primarily the same services as Paychex Premier,
    except Paychex serves as a co-employer of the clients’
    employees, assumes the risks and rewards of workers’
    compensation insurance, and provides more sophisticated health
    care offerings to PEO clients.

Principles of consolidation:

The
    Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash and
    cash equivalents consist of available cash, money market
    securities, U.S. agency discount notes, and other
    investments with a maturity of three months or less as of the
    balance sheet date. Amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets approximate fair value.

Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful
    accounts:

Accounts receivable balances are
    shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts of $4.0 million as of May 31,
    2009 and $4.1 million as of May 31, 2008. Amounts
    reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair
    value. No single client had a material impact on total accounts
    receivable, service revenue, or results of operations.

Funds held for clients and corporate
    investments:

Marketable securities included
    in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist
    primarily of securities classified as

available-for-sale

and are recorded at fair value obtained from an independent
    pricing service. These investment portfolios also include cash,
    money market securities, and short-term investments. Unrealized
    gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported
    as comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity. Realized gains and losses on the
    sales of securities are determined by specific identification of
    the cost basis of each security. On the Consolidated Statements
    of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients
    are included in interest on funds held for clients and realized
    gains and losses from corporate investments are included in
    investment income, net.

Concentrations:

Substantially all of
    the Company’s deposited cash is maintained at two large
    credit-worthy financial institutions. These deposits may exceed
    the amount of any insurance provided. All of the Company’s
    deliverable securities are held in custody with one of the two
    aforementioned financial institutions, for which that
    institution bears the risk of custodial loss. Non-deliverable
    securities, primarily time deposits and money market mutual
    funds, are restricted to credit-worthy financial institutions.

Property and equipment, net of accumulated
    depreciation:

Property and equipment is
    stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
    Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of property
    and equipment using the straight-line method. The estimated
    useful lives of depreciable assets are generally ten to
    35 years, or the remaining life, whichever is shorter, for
    buildings and improvements; two to seven years for data
    processing equipment; seven years for furniture and fixtures;
    and ten years or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter,
    for leasehold improvements. Normal and recurring repair and
    maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. The
    Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for
    impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.

Software development and
    enhancements:

Expenditures for software
    purchases and software developed for internal use are
    capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives, which are generally three to five years,
    except for substantial changes in the functionality of
    processing applications, for which the estimated useful life may
    be longer. For software developed for internal use, costs are
    capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use.” Capitalized internal use
    software costs include external direct costs of materials and
    services associated with developing or obtaining the software,
    and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are
    directly associated with internal-use software projects.
    Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at
    which the project is substantially complete and ready for its
    intended use. Costs associated with preliminary project stage
    activities, training, maintenance, and other post-implementation
    stage activities are expensed as incurred. The carrying value of
    software and development costs is reviewed for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of such assets may not be recoverable.

Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated
    amortization:

The Company has recorded
    goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of businesses.
    Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment
    on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs
    or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been
    a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.
    Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including
    goodwill. The Company’s business is largely homogeneous
    and, as a result, substantially all the goodwill is associated
    with one reporting unit.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company performs its annual impairment testing in its fiscal
    fourth quarter. Based on the Company’s review, no
    impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for
    fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, or fiscal 2007. Subsequent to this
    review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate
    any potential impairment of the Company’s goodwill balance.

Intangible assets are primarily comprised of client list
    acquisitions and license agreements with independently owned
    associate offices and are reported net of accumulated
    amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Intangible
    assets are amortized over periods generally ranging from five to
    twelve years using either the straight-line method, an
    accelerated method, or based on client attrition. The Company
    tests intangible assets for potential impairment when events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
    such assets may not be recoverable.

Other long-term assets:

Other long-term
    assets are primarily related to the Company’s investment as
    a limited partner in various low-income housing partnerships.
    These partnerships were determined to be variable interest
    entities. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these
    variable interest entities and, therefore, does not consolidate
    them in its results of operations or financial position. The
    investments in these partnerships are accounted for under the
    equity method of accounting, with the Company’s share of
    partnership losses recorded in investment income, net on the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. The net investment in these
    entities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was
    $1.5 million as of May 31, 2009 and $2.5 million
    as of May 31, 2008.

Accrual for client fund losses:

The
    Company maintains an accrual for estimated losses associated
    with its clients’ inability to meet their payroll
    obligations. As part of providing payroll, payroll tax
    administration services, and employee payment services, the
    Company is authorized by the client to initiate money transfers
    from the client’s bank account for the amount of tax
    obligations and employees’ direct deposits. Electronic
    money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to
    potential risk of loss resulting from clients’ insufficient
    funds to cover such transfers. The Company evaluates certain
    uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyzes historical
    experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine
    the likelihood of recovery from the clients.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenue is
    recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
    service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
    or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Certain processing services are provided under annual service
    arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
    service period. The Company’s service revenue is largely
    attributable to payroll-related processing services where the
    fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed
    amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or
    transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service
    for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and
    reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the
    delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net
    of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes,
    benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct
    costs billed and incurred were $2.6 billion for each of
    fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2007, respectively.

Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized
    when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence that
    an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order;
    delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is
    fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and
    collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are
    generally purchased by the Company’s clients in conjunction
    with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions.
    Revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably
    over the term of the contract.

In certain situations the Company allows a client a right of
    return or refund. The Company maintains an allowance for
    returns, which is based on historical data. The allowance is
    reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to
    revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in
    which the adjustment is identified.

NOTES TO

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
    that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
    administration services and for employee payment services, and
    invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on
    these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and
    remitting of these funds are critical components of providing
    these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
    net realized gains and losses from the sales of

available-for-sale

securities.

Advantage Payroll Services Inc. (“Advantage”), a
    subsidiary of the Company, has license agreements with
    independently owned associate offices (“Associates”).
    The Associates are responsible for selling and marketing
    Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational
    functions. Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized
    back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration
    services for the Associates, including the billing and
    collection of processing fees and the collection and remittance
    of payroll and payroll tax funds pursuant to Advantage’s
    service arrangement with Associate customers. The marketing and
    selling by the Associates is conducted under their respective
    logos. Commissions earned by the Associates are based on the
    processing activity for the related clients. Revenue generated
    from customers as a result of these relationships and
    commissions paid to Associates are included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income as service revenue and selling, general and
    administrative expense, respectively.

PEO workers’ compensation
    insurance:

Workers’ compensation
    insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated
    costs of paying claims underwritten by the Company. These
    reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for
    those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain
    expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In
    establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves,
    the Company uses an independent actuarial estimate of
    undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle
    the claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
    and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
    actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
    multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal
    liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially
    impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from
    the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not
    occur until well into the future.

The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated
    workers’ compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to
    previously established reserves are reflected in the results of
    operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified.
    Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
    variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

In fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, workers’ compensation
    insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on
    claims paid as incurred. The Company’s maximum individual
    claims liability was $1 million under both its fiscal 2009
    and its fiscal 2008 policies.

The Company had recorded the following amounts on its
    Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation
    claims as of:

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stock-based compensation costs:

In
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004)
    (“SFAS No. 123R”), “Share-Based
    Payment,” all stock-based awards to employees, including
    grants of stock options, are recognized as compensation costs in
    the Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values
    measured as of the date of grant. These costs are recognized as
    expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the
    requisite service period and increase additional paid-in capital.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires
    various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of
    the Paychex stock price and expected option life. Volatility is
    estimated based on a combination of historical volatility using
    weekly stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a
    period equal to the expected option life. Expected option life
    is estimated based on historical exercise behavior.

The Company is required to estimate forfeitures and only record
    compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest.
    The assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of
    award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are
    adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified
    with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the
    final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to
    equal actual forfeitures.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in the Company’s results of operations.

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its
    application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of
    stock option grants. The Company periodically reassesses its
    assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will
    reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes
    available in the future indicating that another model would
    provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if
    characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.

Refer to Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion of the Company’s
    stock-based compensation plans.

Income taxes:

The Company accounts for
    deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and
    liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
    that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
    or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
    financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities
    using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a
    deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs
    recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of the
    exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of restricted
    stock awards, the Company accounts for the resulting tax
    deduction by reducing its accrued income tax liability with an
    offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit
    increasing additional paid-in capital. The Company currently has
    a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in
    capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to
    stock-based awards. The company also maintains a reserve for
    uncertain tax positions in accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48
    (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109.”

Use of estimates:

The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires
    management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that
    affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts and results
    could differ from these estimates.

New accounting pronouncements:

In
    December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised
    2007) (“SFAS No. 141R”), “Business
    Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R provides guidance on
    how an entity will recognize

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and measure the identifiable assets acquired (including
    goodwill), liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests, if
    any, acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 141R
    further requires that acquisition-related costs and costs
    associated with restructuring or exiting activities of an
    acquired entity will be expensed as incurred.
    SFAS No. 141R will impact business combinations that
    may be completed on or after June 1, 2009. The Company
    cannot anticipate whether the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141R will have a material effect on its
    results of operations or financial position as the impact is
    solely dependent on whether the Company enters into any business
    combination, and the terms of such transactions.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. FAS 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets.” This FSP amends the factors that should be
    considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used
    to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset
    under SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.” The intent is to improve the
    consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible
    asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected
    cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under
    SFAS No. 141R and other U.S. GAAP. This standard
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year
    beginning June 1, 2009. The Company does not expect that
    the adoption of this FSP will have an effect on its results of
    operations or financial condition.

In April 2009, the FASB issued the following three staff
    positions intended to provide additional accounting guidance and
    enhanced disclosures regarding fair value measurements and
    impairments of debt securities:

•

FSP

No. FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1,

“Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments,” requiring publicly traded companies to
    disclose the fair value of financial instruments in interim
    financial statements;

•

FSP

No. FAS 157-4,

“Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of
    Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased
    and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly,”
    providing guidance for determining fair value when there is no
    active market or where price inputs being used represent
    distressed sales; and

•

FSP

No. FAS 115-2

and

FAS 124-2,

“Recognition and Presentation of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairments,” providing guidance for measurement and
    recognition of impaired debt securities along with expanded
    disclosures with respect to impaired debt securities.

These FSPs are effective for interim and annual periods ending
    after June 15, 2009, and are applicable to the
    Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. The
    Company does not expect that the adoption of these FSPs will
    have a material effect on its results of operations or financial
    position.

In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165,
    “Subsequent Events.” This statement establishes
    guidance related to accounting for and disclosure of events that
    happen after the date of the balance sheet but before the
    release of the financial statements. SFAS No. 165 is
    effective for reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009.
    The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 165 in its
    fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. The Company does not
    expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect
    on its results of operations or financial position.

In June 2009, the FASB issued the following standards:

•

SFAS No. 166, “Accounting for Transfers of
    Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 140;” and

•

SFAS No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation
    No. 46(R).”

Both standards are effective for annual periods beginning after
    November 15, 2009, and are applicable to the Company’s
    fiscal year beginning June 1, 2010. The Company is
    currently evaluating both standards but does not expect their
    adoption to have a material effect on its results of operations
    or financial position.

Reclassification
    Within Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

Client fund obligations represent the Company’s contractual
    obligation to remit funds to satisfy clients’ payroll and
    tax payment obligations. To better reflect the nature of these
    activities, in fiscal 2008 the Company reclassified the net
    change in client fund obligations in the Consolidated Statements
    of Cash Flows from investing activities to financing activities
    for all periods presented. The impacts of the reclassification
    to prior year periods were as follows:

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

The Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and
    restated (the “2002 Plan”), became effective on
    October 12, 2005 upon its approval by the Company’s
    stockholders. The 2002 Plan authorizes the granting of options
    to purchase up to 29.1 million shares of the Company’s
    common stock. As of May 31, 2009, there were
    14.3 million shares available for future grants under the
    2002 Plan. No future grants will be made pursuant to the
    Paychex, Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, which expired in August
    2002; however, options to purchase an aggregate of
    2.0 million shares under the plan remain outstanding as of
    May 31, 2009.

The Company accounts for stock-based awards in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R. This statement requires that all
    stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock
    options, be recognized as compensation costs in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of
    the date of grant. These costs are recognized as an expense in
    the Consolidated Statements of Income over the requisite service
    period and increase additional paid-in capital.

The Company adopted this standard as of June 1, 2006 (the
    “adoption date”) using the modified-prospective
    transition method. Under this method, compensation costs were
    recognized for: (1) stock-based awards granted after the
    adoption date based on grant date fair value in accordance with
    the provisions of SFAS No. 123R on a straight-line
    basis over the requisite service period; and (2) the
    unvested portion of any grants issued prior to the adoption date
    based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with
    the original provisions of SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” on an
    accelerated basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based
    compensation expense was $25.7 million, $25.4 million,
    and $25.7 million for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, and fiscal
    2007, respectively. Related income tax benefits recognized were
    $8.0 million, $7.4 million, and $7.6 million for
    the respective fiscal years. Capitalized stock-based
    compensation costs related to the development of internal use
    software for these same fiscal years were not significant.

As of May 31, 2009, the total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to all unvested stock-based awards was
    $60.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 2.3 years.

Stock option grants:

Stock option
    grants entitle the holder to purchase, at the end of the vesting
    term, a specified number of shares of Paychex common stock at an
    exercise price per share set equal to the closing market price
    of the common stock on the date of grant. All stock option
    grants have a contractual life of ten years from the date of the
    grant and a vesting schedule as established by the Board of
    Directors (the “Board”). The Company issues new shares
    of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises. Non-qualified
    stock option grants to officers, outside directors, and
    management are typically approved by the Board in July.
    Non-qualified stock option grants to officers and management,
    beginning with grants in July 2005, vest 20% per annum.
    Non-qualified stock option grants to the Board vest one-third
    per annum.

The fair value of stock option grants was estimated at the date
    of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model for grants
    prior to and subsequent to the adoption date. The
    weighted-average assumptions used for valuation under the
    Black-Scholes model are as follows:

Expected option life in years

Risk-free interest rates are yields for zero coupon
    U.S. Treasury notes maturing approximately at the end of
    the expected option life. The estimated volatility factor is
    based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly
    stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a period
    equal to the expected option life. The expected option life is
    based on historical exercise behavior.

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its
    application, are appropriate in estimating the fair value of its
    stock option grants. The Company periodically assesses its
    assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will
    reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes
    available in the future indicating that another model would
    provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if
    characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.

Restricted stock awards:

Beginning in
    July 2006, the Board approved grants of restricted stock awards
    to the Company’s officers and outside directors in
    accordance with the 2002 Plan. All shares underlying awards of
    restricted stock are restricted in that they are not
    transferable until they vest. The recipients of the restricted
    stock have voting rights and earn dividends, which are paid to
    the recipient at the time of vesting of the awards. If the
    recipient leaves Paychex prior to the vesting date for any
    reason, the shares of restricted stock and the dividends accrued
    on those shares will be forfeited and returned to Paychex.

For restricted stock awards granted to officers, the shares vest
    upon the fifth anniversary of the grant date provided the
    recipient is still an employee of the Company on that date.
    These awards have a provision for the acceleration of vesting
    based on achievement of performance targets established by the
    Board. If the established targets are met for a fiscal year,
    one-third of the award will vest. If the targets are met for
    three consecutive years, the award will be fully vested. For
    outside directors, the shares vest on the third anniversary of
    the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock awards is
    equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock
    as of the date of grant and is expensed over the requisite
    service period on a straight-line basis.

Restricted stock units:

Beginning in
    July 2007, the Board approved grants of restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”) to non-officer management as a replacement of
    non-qualified stock options. RSUs do not have voting rights or
    earn dividend equivalents during the vesting period. These
    awards vest 20% per annum over five years with a small
    population of awards vesting on the fourth anniversary of the
    grant date. The fair value of RSUs is equal to the closing
    market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of
    grant, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends over
    the vesting period.

Non-compensatory employee benefit
    plan:

The Company offers an Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan to all employees under which the Company’s
    common stock can be purchased through a payroll deduction with
    no discount to the market price and no look-back provision. All
    transactions occur directly through the Company’s transfer
    agent and no brokerage fees are charged to employees, except for
    when stock is sold. The plan has been deemed non-compensatory
    subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 123R and,
    therefore, no stock-based compensation costs have been
    recognized for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, or fiscal 2007 related
    to this plan.

The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these
    investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to
    meet the terms of their bonds. In addition, the Company is
    exposed to interest rate risk, as rate volatility will cause
    fluctuations in the fair value of held investments and in the
    earnings potential of future investments. The Company maintains
    a conservative investment strategy within its investment
    portfolios to maximize liquidity and protect principal. The
    Company attempts to mitigate the risks associated with its
    investment activities by investing primarily in high credit
    quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term
    securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings, limiting amounts that can be invested in any single
    issuer, and by investing in short- to intermediate-term
    instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate
    changes. All the investments held as of May 31, 2009 are
    traded in active markets.

As of May 31, 2009, the Company had no exposure to variable
    rate demand notes or prime money market funds. The Company sold
    all of its holdings in these types of investments in September
    2008 as a result of turmoil in the related markets. No losses
    were recognized on these sales. The proceeds from the sale of
    these investments were reinvested into U.S. agency discount
    notes, which is the Company’s current primary short-term
    investment vehicle. The Company has no exposure to auction rate
    securities,

sub-prime

mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed
    commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash
    or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles
    (SIVs). The Company has not and does not utilize derivative
    financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.

The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to
    determine if any investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential
    valuation concerns. The Company believes that the investments it
    held as of May 31, 2009 were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired. While certain

available-for-sale

securities had fair values that were below cost, the Company
    believes that it is probable that the principal and interest
    will be collected in accordance with contractual terms, and that
    the decline in the fair value was due to changes in interest
    rates and was not due to increased credit risk. As of
    May 31, 2009 and 2008, the majority of the securities in an
    unrealized loss position held an AA rating or better. The
    Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments
    until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. The
    Company’s assessment that an investment is not

other-than-temporarily

impaired could change in the future due to new developments or
    changes in the Company’s strategies or assumptions related
    to any particular investment.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Effective June 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”
    This statement clarifies the definition of fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    the disclosures



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

on fair value measurements; however, this standard does not
    require any new fair value measurements. The adoption of this
    standard has not had a material effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or financial position.

SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy for information
    and valuations used in measuring fair value that is broken down
    into three levels based on reliability. Level 1 valuations
    are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical
    assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
    access. Level 2 valuations are based on inputs, other than
    quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable,
    either directly or indirectly. Level 3 valuations are based
    on information that is unobservable and significant to the
    overall fair value measurement.

The following table presents information on the Company’s
    financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis under SFAS No. 157 as of May 31,
    2009:

In determining the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the
    Company uses various valuation approaches, predominately the
    market and income approaches. The components of the
    Company’s

available-for-sale

securities are disclosed in Note E to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. In determining the fair value of its

available-for-sale

securities, the Company utilizes the Interactive Data Pricing
    service, a market approach. Other securities are comprised of
    mutual fund investments, which are valued based on quoted market
    prices. Other long-term liabilities includes the liability for
    the Company’s non-qualified and unfunded deferred
    compensation plan, and is valued based on the quoted market
    prices for various mutual fund investment choices.

The preceding method described may produce a fair value
    calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value
    or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the
    Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
    consistent with other market participants, the use of different
    methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
    certain financial instruments could result in a different fair
    value measurement at the reporting date.

As of May 31, 2009, the Company did not have any assets or
    liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using
    significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

On June 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48, and its
    related amendment. These standards prescribe minimum recognition
    thresholds for evaluating uncertain income tax positions, and
    provide guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
    disclosure, and transition. The impact of the adoption mainly
    affected the state income tax rate, net of federal benefit.

Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect
    adjustment by increasing its reserve for uncertain tax positions
    by $8.4 million, with an offsetting decrease to opening
    retained earnings. As of May 31, 2009, the total reserve
    for uncertain tax positions was $25.7 million and is
    included in long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the
    Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, not including
    interest or other potential offsetting effects, is as follows:

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well
    as income tax in one foreign and numerous state jurisdictions.
    Uncertain tax positions relate primarily to state income tax
    matters. The Company believes it is



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

probable that the reserve for uncertain tax positions will
    increase in the next twelve months, resulting from the
    settlement of open periods and the effect of operations on
    anticipated tax benefits. It is anticipated that this increase
    will impact the tax provision in the range of $1.0 to
    $3.0 million. The Company is currently under a state income
    tax audit for fiscal 2004 through 2007. The examination phase of
    the audit may conclude within the next twelve months; however,
    based on the current status of the examination, it is not
    reasonably possible to estimate the impact, if any, to the
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax
    matters through its fiscal year ended May 31, 2006, with
    fiscal 2007, 2008, and 2009 still subject to potential audit.
    With limited exception, state income tax audits by taxing
    authorities are closed through fiscal 2004, primarily due to
    expiration of the statute of limitations. Audit outcomes and the
    timing of audit settlements are subject to a high degree of
    uncertainty. As of May 31, 2009, substantially all of the
    $25.7 million reserve for uncertain tax positions, if
    recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective
    income tax rate.

The Company continues to follow its policy of recognizing
    interest and penalties accrued on tax positions as a component
    of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
    amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with the
    Company’s tax positions is immaterial to the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The amount of interest and penalties recognized
    for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 was immaterial to the
    Company’s results of operations.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

401(k) plan:

The Company maintains a
    contributory savings plan that qualifies under
    section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Paychex,
    Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan (the “Plan”)
    allows all employees to immediately participate in the salary
    deferral portion of the Plan, contributing up to a maximum of
    50% of their salary. Employees who have completed one year of
    service are eligible to receive a company matching contribution.
    Beginning in September 2007, the Company matches up to 100% of
    the first 3% of eligible pay and up to 50% of the next 2% of
    eligible pay that an employee contributes to the Plan. Prior to
    September 2007, the Company matched



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

50% of an employee’s voluntary contribution up to 6% of
    eligible pay. Effective April 1, 2009, the Company has
    suspended the discretionary matching contribution for a
    twelve-month period.

The Plan is 100% participant-directed. Plan participants can
    fully diversify their portfolios by choosing from any or all
    investment fund choices in the Plan. Transfers in and out of
    investment funds, including the Paychex, Inc. Employee Stock
    Ownership Plan (ESOP) Stock Fund, are not restricted in any
    manner. The Company match contribution follows the same fund
    elections as the employee compensation deferrals.

Company contributions to the Plan for fiscal 2009, 2008, and
    2007 were $14.3 million, $15.1 million, and
    $10.2 million, respectively.

Deferred compensation plans:

The
    Company offers non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation
    plans to a select group of key employees, executive officers,
    and outside directors. Eligible employees are provided with the
    opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and
    bonus and outside directors to defer 100% of their Board cash
    compensation. Gains and losses are credited based on the
    participant’s election of a variety of investment choices.
    The Company does not match any participant deferral or guarantee
    its return. Distributions are paid at one of the following dates
    selected by the participant: the participant’s termination
    date, the date the participant retires from any active
    employment, or a designated specific date. In fiscal 2009,
    participants were allowed to make a one-time election for a
    distribution under the Internal Revenue Service
    Section 409A transition rules. The amounts accrued under
    these plans were $6.2 million and $10.2 million as of
    May 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are reflected in
    other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

Prior to the April 1, 2003 acquisition, InterPay, Inc.
    (“InterPay”) entered into various salary continuation
    agreements with certain former employees. These agreements
    provide for benefits to these retired employees, and in certain
    cases to their beneficiaries, for life or other designated
    periods through 2015. The amounts accrued under these agreements
    were $0.8 million and $1.1 million as of May 31,
    2009 and May 31, 2008, respectively, and represent the
    estimated present value of the benefits earned under these
    agreements.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Lines of credit:

As of May 31,
    2009, the Company had unused borrowing capacity available under
    four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market
    rates of interest with financial institutions as follows:

February 2010

The credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are
    secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between
    Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the
    “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Company has granted
    each of the Lenders a security interest in certain investment
    securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
    custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and
    is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the
    Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may
    require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account
    into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual
    Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
    short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
    overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic
    payment transactions on behalf of clients in the ordinary course
    of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against
    these lines of credit during fiscal 2009 or as of May 31,
    2009.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. are also
    parties to the Company’s credit facility and irrevocable
    standby letters of credit, which arrangements are discussed
    below.

Credit facility:

The Company has a
    committed, secured, one-year revolving credit facility, expiring
    on September 20, 2009. Paychex of New York LLC (the
    “Borrower”), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into
    the credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of
    America, N.A. (the “Credit Agreement Lenders”). This
    credit facility was available to extend the duration of the
    Company’s long-term investment portfolio. The credit
    facility has not been used during fiscal 2009 or as of
    May 31, 2009, and the Company does not have plans for it in
    the future. The credit facility is collateralized by the
    long-term securities of the Borrower, to the extent of any
    borrowing. Under the credit facility the Borrower may, subject
    to certain restrictions, borrow up to $400 million to meet
    short-term funding requirements on client fund obligations. The
    obligations under this credit facility have been guaranteed by
    the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. Upon expiration of
    the commitment in September 2009, any borrowings outstanding
    will mature and be payable on such date.

The revolving loans under the credit facility will bear interest
    at competitive rates to be elected by the Borrower. The Borrower
    will also pay a facility fee at a rate of .05% per annum on the
    average daily unused amount of the commitment.

The credit facility includes various financial and other
    customary covenants, with which the Borrower must comply in
    order to maintain borrowing availability and avoid penalties,
    including a limitation on the Borrower’s ability to incur
    additional indebtedness, create liens, enter into consolidations
    or mergers, dispose of assets, make investments, pay dividends,
    enter into transactions with affiliates, or prepay certain
    indebtedness. The credit facility (and collateral security
    agreements executed in connection therewith) also contains
    customary events of default including, but not limited to,
    payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other
    indebtedness, material judgment defaults, inaccuracy of
    representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency
    events, defects in the Credit Agreement Lenders’ security
    interest, change in control events, and material adverse changes.

Certain Credit Agreement Lenders under the credit facility, and
    their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the
    future perform for the Company and its subsidiaries, various
    commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting, and other
    financial advisory services, for which they have received, and
    will receive, customary fees and expenses.

Letters of credit:

The Company had
    irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling
    $65.8 million and $71.5 million as of May 31,
    2009 and May 31, 2008, respectively, required to secure
    commitments for certain insurance policies and bonding
    requirements. Letters of credit as of May 31, 2009 expire
    at various dates between December 2009 and December 2012 and are
    collateralized by securities held in the Company’s
    investment portfolios. No amounts were outstanding on these
    letters of credit during fiscal 2009 or as of May 31, 2009.

Contingencies:

The Company is subject
    to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal
    course of its business. These include disputes or potential
    disputes related to breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
    duty, employment-related claims, tax claims, and other matters.

In August 2001, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary,
    Rapid Payroll, Inc. (“Rapid Payroll”) informed
    76 licensees that it intended to stop supporting their
    payroll processing software in August of 2002. Thereafter,
    lawsuits were commenced by licensees asserting various claims,
    including breach of contract and related tort and fraud causes
    of action. As previously reported in the Company’s prior
    periodic reports, these lawsuits sought compensatory damages,
    punitive damages, and injunctive relief against Rapid Payroll,
    the Company, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer,
    and the Company’s former Senior Vice President of Sales and
    Marketing. In accordance with the Company’s indemnification
    agreements with its senior executives, the Company has agreed to
    defend and, if necessary, indemnify them in connection with
    these pending matters.

At the present time, the Company has fully resolved its
    licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with
    75 of the 76 licensees who were provided services by Rapid
    Payroll. In 2007, a verdict was issued in the

Brunskill
    Associates, Inc. v. Rapid Payroll, Inc. et al

. case,
    which was pending in California Superior Court, Los Angeles



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

County, in which a jury awarded to the plaintiff
    $15.0 million in compensatory damages and subsequently
    awarded an additional $11.0 million in punitive damages.
    The Company is pursuing an appeal of that verdict. Any final
    judgment could be subject to an award of statutory interest.

The Company has a reserve for pending litigation matters. The
    litigation reserve has been adjusted in fiscal 2009 for
    settlements and incurred litigation expenditures. The
    Company’s reserve for all pending litigation totaled
    $20.4 million as of May 31, 2009, and is included in
    current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets contained
    in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

In light of the reserve for all pending litigation matters, the
    Company’s management currently believes that resolution of
    outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent
    uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate
    resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact
    on the Company’s financial position and results of
    operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

Lease commitments:

The Company leases
    office space and data processing equipment under terms of
    various operating leases. Rent expense for fiscal 2009, 2008,
    and 2007 was $46.6 million, $44.5 million, and
    $41.4 million, respectively. As of May 31, 2009,
    future minimum lease payments under various non-cancelable
    operating leases with terms of more than one year are as follows:

The amounts shown above for operating leases include obligations

Other commitments:

As of May 31,
    2009, the Company had outstanding commitments under purchase
    orders and legally binding contractual arrangements with minimum
    future payment obligations of approximately $59.8 million,
    including $4.5 million of commitments to purchase capital
    assets. These minimum future payment obligations relate to the

The Company guarantees performance of service on annual
    maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service
    contracts through a third party. In the normal course of
    business, the Company makes representations and warranties that
    guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements
    with clients. In addition, the Company has entered into
    indemnification agreements with its officers and directors,
    which require the Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify
    these individuals for certain pending or future claims as they
    relate to their

services provided to the Company. Historically, there have been
    no material losses related to such guarantees and
    indemnifications.

Paychex currently self-insures the deductible portion of various
    insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. The
    Company’s estimated loss exposure under these insurance
    arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued
    have not been material. The Company also maintains insurance
    coverage in addition to its purchased primary insurance policies
    for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and
    omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism; and
    capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through its
    captive insurance company.

During fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company purchased

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting:

Disclosure controls
    and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that
    information required to be disclosed in the Company’s
    reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”), such as this report, is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure
    controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of
    ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated
    to the Company’s management, including the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures:

As of the end of the period
    covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and
    procedures as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this
    report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective.

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
    Reporting:

During the three months ended
    May 31, 2009, the Company implemented changes to processes,
    procedures, and controls as a result of enhancements to its core
    processing capability. There were no other changes in the
    Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that
    occurred during the Company’s most recently completed
    fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

The Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm on Effectiveness of Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting are incorporated herein by
    reference from Part II, Item 8 of this
