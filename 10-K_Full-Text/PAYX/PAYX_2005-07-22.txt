Item 1.

Business

Paychex is a leading national provider of comprehensive payroll
and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing
solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses in the United
States. The Company, a Delaware corporation formed in 1979,
reports its results of operations and financial condition as one
business segment. The Company’s fiscal year ends
May 31. At May 31, 2005, Paychex serviced



approximately 522,000 clients and had approximately 10,000
employees. The Company maintains its corporate headquarters in
Rochester, New York, and has more than 100 offices nationwide.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company formed a
subsidiary in Germany and opened an office in Hamburg. The
Germany operation served approximately 150 clients as of
May 31, 2005. In May 2005, the Germany operation leased a
second office in Berlin.

Company Strategy

Paychex is focused on achieving strong long-term financial
performance while:

Market Opportunities

The outsourcing of business processes is a growing trend within
the United States. Outsourcing of the payroll and human resource
functions allows small- to medium-sized businesses to minimize
the administrative burden and compliance risks associated with
increasingly complex and changing administrative requirements
and federal, state, and local tax regulations. By utilizing the
expertise of outsourcing service providers, businesses are
better able to efficiently meet their compliance requirements
and administrative burdens while, at the same time, providing
competitive benefits for their employees. The technical
capabilities, knowledge, and operational expertise that Paychex
has built, along with the broad portfolio of ancillary services
it offers its clients, have enabled the Company to capitalize on
the outsourcing trend.

There are approximately 7.4 million employers in the
geographic markets that Paychex currently serves within the
United States. Of those employers, 99% have fewer than 100
employees and are the Company’s primary customers and
target market. Based on publicly available industry data, the
Company estimates that all payroll processors combined serve
somewhere between 15% to 20% of the potential businesses in the
target market, with much of the unpenetrated market being
composed of businesses with ten or fewer employees. Paychex
remains focused on servicing small- to medium-sized businesses
based upon the growth potential that management believes exists
in this market segment.

Clients

Paychex serves a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients
operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the
continental United States. At May 31, 2005, the Company
serviced approximately 522,000 clients. The Company utilizes
service agreements and arrangements with clients that are
generally terminable by the client at any time or upon
relatively short notice. Fiscal year client retention is at
record levels of slightly less than 80% of the beginning client
base. The most significant factor contributing to client losses
is companies going out of business. No single client has a
material impact on total service revenues or results of
operations.



The composition of the market and the client base serviced by
Paychex (in the United States) by employee size is as follows:

Products and Services

Paychex offers a comprehensive portfolio of payroll,
payroll-related, and human resource products and services to
meet the diverse needs of its client base. These include payroll
processing, tax filing and payment services, employee payment
services, time and attendance solutions, regulatory compliance
(new-hire reporting and garnishment processing), retirement
services administration, employee benefits administration,
workers’ compensation insurance administration, and
comprehensive human resource administrative services. By
offering ancillary services that leverage the information
gathered in the base payroll processing service, Paychex is able
to provide comprehensive outsourcing services that allow
employers to expand their employee benefits offerings at an
affordable cost. The Company earns its revenues primarily
through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenues
are largely driven by the number of clients, utilization of
ancillary services, and checks or transactions per client per
pay period.

Payroll
Processing

Payroll processing is the foundation of the Paychex service
portfolio. The Paychex payroll service includes the calculation,
preparation, and delivery of employee payroll checks; production
of internal accounting records and management reports; and the
preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns.
Payroll processing clients are charged a base fee each period
that payroll is processed, plus a fee per employee check
processed.

The Core Payroll service is generally targeted for clients with
one to forty-nine employees, although many clients with fifty or
more employees utilize this service. The Company’s average
Core Payroll client employs approximately thirteen people and
processes approximately thirty payrolls each year. These figures
are impacted year over year as larger clients, generally fifty
or more employees, convert to the Company’s Major Market
Services (“MMS”).

Core Payroll clients may communicate their payroll information,
including hours worked by each employee and any personnel or
compensation changes, by telephone, fax, use of the Paychex
Paylink® software or the Internet. Each client is assigned
a payroll specialist who is trained extensively and continuously
in all facets of payroll preparation and applicable tax
regulations. Clients receive payroll checks and reports from
either a delivery service, the United States Postal Service, or
by picking them up at the local Paychex branch.

Paychex also offers Core Payroll services to its clients and
their accountants through Paychex Online. This secure Internet
site offers clients a suite of interactive, self-service
products and services twenty-four hours a day, seven days a
week. These include Paychex Online
Payroll

sm

,
Internet Time Sheet, Paychex Online Reports, and General Ledger
Reporting Service. Clients can communicate payroll information
through the Internet Time Sheet or use the Online Payroll
service, and can access current and historical payroll
information using Paychex Online Reports. The General Ledger
Reporting Service transfers payroll information calculated by
Paychex to the client’s general ledger accounting software,
eliminating manual entries and improving the accuracy of
bookkeeping. Over 150,000 clients are currently utilizing some
form of Paychex online service.



The Company’s Major Market Services primarily target
companies that have more complex payroll and benefits needs or
have outgrown the Company’s Core Payroll service, as well
as new clients that have fifty or more employees. The Company
currently offers this service in all of its significant markets.
Approximately one-third of new MMS clients are conversions from
the Company’s Core Payroll service.

Most MMS clients communicate their payroll information to
Paychex using the Company’s Preview® software.
Preview® provides clients with in-house control of payroll
and human resource information because the software and the
payroll and human resource database reside on the client’s
personal computer or personal computer network. Clients can
produce reports and checks at their convenience. Paychex handles
the software maintenance and provides the client ancillary
services as requested.

Ancillary
Products and Services

Paychex provides its clients with a portfolio of ancillary
products and services that have been developed and refined over
many years. Ancillary products provide the Company with
additional recurring revenue streams and increased service
efficiencies as these products are integrated with payroll
processing services. Paychex offers the following ancillary
products and services:

Tax Filing and Payment Services:

As of
May 31, 2005, 90% of the Company’s clients utilized
its tax filing and payment services (including Taxpay®),
which provide accurate preparation and timely filing of
quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic
transfer of funds to the appropriate agencies (federal, state,
and local). More than 95% of new clients purchase the
Company’s tax filing and payment services. The Company
believes that the client utilization percentage of these
services is near maturity. In connection with these services,
the Company electronically collects payroll taxes from
clients’ bank accounts, typically on the payday, files the
applicable tax returns, and pays taxes to the appropriate taxing
authorities on the respective due dates. These taxes are
typically paid between one and thirty days after receipt of
collections from clients, with some items extending to ninety
days. The Company handles all regulatory correspondence,
amendments, and penalty and interest disputes, and is subject to
cash penalties imposed by tax authorities for late filings and
late- or under-payments of taxes. Clients utilizing the tax
filing and payment services are charged a base fee each period
that payroll is processed. In addition to fees paid by clients,
the Company earns interest on client funds that are collected
before due dates and invested until remittance to the
appropriate taxing authority.

Employee Payment Services:

As of May 31,
2005, 65% of the Company’s clients utilized its employee
payment services, which provide the employer the option of
paying their employees by direct deposit, Paychex Access
Visa® Card, a check drawn on a Paychex account
(Readychex®), or a check drawn on the employer’s
account and electronically signed by Paychex. More than 75% of
new clients purchase some form of employee payment services.
Except for the last method, Paychex electronically collects net
payroll from the client’s bank account, typically one day
before payroll, and provides payment to the employee on payday.
The Company’s flexible payment options provide a
cost-effective solution that offers the benefit of convenient,
one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers. Clients
utilizing employee payment services are charged a base fee for
each period that payroll is processed and a fee per transaction
or per employee depending on the service provided. In addition
to fees paid by clients, the Company earns interest on client
funds that are collected before pay dates and invested until
remittance to clients’ employees.

The tax filing and payment services and employee payment
services are integrated with the Company’s payroll
processing service. Interest earned on funds held for clients is
included in total revenues on the Consolidated Statements of
Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these
funds are critical components of providing these services.

Time and Attendance Solutions:

Paychex offers Time
In A Box® and other time and attendance solutions, which
help businesses or employers minimize the time spent compiling
time sheet information. These computer-based systems allow the
employer flexibility to handle multiple payroll scenarios and
result in improved productivity, accuracy, and reliability in
the payroll process. Certain clients are charged a monthly fee
for use of hardware, software, and support. Clients also have
the option to purchase the hardware and software with annual
maintenance contracts. Time In A Box® is marketed to
Paychex’s small- to medium-



sized clients, while other time and attendance solutions are
marketed to larger clients as such other time and attendance
solutions may better fit their requirements.

Regulatory Compliance Services:

Paychex offers
new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to comply with
federal and state requirements to report information on newly
hired employees, to aid the government in enforcing child
support orders, and to minimize fraudulent unemployment and
workers’ compensation insurance claims. The Company’s
garnishment processing service provides deductions from
employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies,
including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the
obligation to fulfillment. These services enable employers to
comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties.

Comprehensive Administrative Services:

The Paychex
Administrative Services (“PAS”) provide businesses a
full-service approach to the outsourcing of employer and
employee administrative needs. PAS offers businesses a combined
package of services that includes payroll, employer compliance,
human resource and employee benefits administration, and risk
management outsourcing. This comprehensive bundle of services is
designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
payroll and benefit costs while providing a benefits package
equal to that of larger companies. The Company also operates a
Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”), which
provides businesses with primarily the same services as PAS, but
with Paychex acting as a co-employer of the client’s
employees. The Company’s PEO service is available primarily
in the states of Florida and Georgia, where PEOs are more
prevalent. Paychex offers its PEO service through its
subsidiary, Paychex Business Solutions, Inc. For these two
services, the client pays a fee per employee per processing
period. As of May 31, 2005, PAS and PEO combined serviced
over 225,000 client employees.

Retirement Services Administration:

The
Company’s Retirement Services product line offers a variety
of options to clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE,
SIMPLE IRA, 401(k) plans with Safe Harbor provisions, profit
sharing, and money purchase plans. These services provide plan
implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations,
employee and employer reporting, participant access online,
electronic funds transfer, and other administrative services.
Selling efforts for these services are focused primarily on the
Company’s existing payroll client base, as the processed
payroll information allows for data integration necessary to
provide these services efficiently. Retirement Services were
utilized by over 33,000 clients at May 31, 2005. This
demonstrates the continuing interest of small- to medium-sized
businesses in providing retirement savings benefits to their
employees. Paychex believes that it is now one of the largest
401(k) recordkeepers for small businesses in the United States.
Clients utilizing this service are charged a one-time set up
fee, a monthly recurring fee, and a fee per employee. Client
employee 401(k) funds externally managed totaled approximately
$5.1 billion at May 31, 2005. The Company earns a fee
approximating thirty basis points from the external managers
based on the total of client employee 401(k) funds.

Workers’ Compensation Insurance
Administration:

Most employers are required to carry
workers’ compensation insurance, which provides payments to
employees who are unable to work because of job-related
injuries. Paychex provides workers’ compensation insurance
administration services by serving, through the Company’s
licensed insurance agency, as a general agent providing
qualified workers’ compensation insurance through a variety
of insurance carriers who are underwriters. The Paychex
workers’ compensation payment service uses rate and job
classification information to enable clients to pay
workers’ compensation premiums in regular monthly amounts
rather than with large up-front payments, which stabilizes their
cash flow and minimizes year-end adjustments. The workers’
compensation report service provides the client with
comprehensive information to allow it to better manage its
workers’ compensation insurance costs. As of May 31,
2005, approximately 44,000 clients utilized the workers’
compensation insurance administration services.

Section 125 Plans:

The Company offers the
outsourcing of plan administration under section 125 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The Premium Only Plan allows employees to
pay for certain health insurance benefits with pretax dollars,
which can result in a reduction in payroll taxes for employers
and employees. The Flexible Spending Account Plan allows a
client’s employees to pay, with pretax dollars, health and
dependent care



expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation,
administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement,
and coverage tests are provided with these services.

Other Human Resource Products and Services:

Group
health benefits are offered in select geographic areas, as are
state unemployment insurance services, which provide clients
with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations,
change statements, and requests for separation documents. Other
Human Resource and Benefits products include employee handbooks,
management manuals, and personnel forms. These products are
designed to simplify clients’ office processes and enhance
their employee benefits programs.

Sales and Marketing

The Company markets its services primarily through its direct
sales force based in major metropolitan markets serviced by the
Company. The Company’s sales representatives specialize in
Core Payroll, Major Market Services payroll, or Human Resource
and Benefits lines. For fiscal 2006, the Company’s sales
force is expected to total approximately 1,805, with 1,115 for
Core Payroll (including international), 195 for Major Market
Services payroll, 470 for various Human Resource and Benefits
products and services and 25 for time and attendance solutions.
The Human Resource and Benefits sales force includes 240 human
resources and 401(k) recordkeeping sales representatives, 160
PAS/ PEO sales representatives, and 70 licensed agents selling
workers’ compensation insurance and health and benefits
services. The direct sales force has grown with the addition of
time and attendance solutions. These products are utilized by
businesses not generally in Paychex’s client base.
Additionally, the complexity of the time and attendance
solutions requires specialized sales representatives.

In addition to its direct selling and marketing efforts, the
Company utilizes relationships with existing clients, certified
public accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client
referrals. Approximately two-thirds of the Company’s new
clients (excluding acquisitions) come from these referral
sources. To further enhance its strong relationship with CPAs,
during fiscal 2004, Paychex partnered with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) as
the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business Solutions
Partner Program. In fiscal 2005, the program was expanded to
include Paychex’s 401(k) recordkeeping services and Major
Market Services. The direct sales force for Human Resource and
Benefits products and services is primarily focused on selling
products and services to existing payroll clients as their
processed payroll information provides the data integration
necessary to more efficiently provide these services.

The Company’s Web site at www.paychex.com, which includes
online payroll sales presentations and product and service
information, is a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of
leads and new sales while complementing the efforts of the
direct sales force. This online tool allows Paychex to market to
clients in more geographically remote areas. The Company’s
sales representatives are also supported by marketing,
advertising, public relations, trade shows, and telemarketing
programs. The Company has grown and expects to continue to grow
its direct sales force. In recent years, the Company has
increased its emphasis on the selling of ancillary services to
both new clients and its existing client base.

The acquisition of Advantage Payroll Services, Inc.
(“Advantage”) in fiscal 2003 provided Paychex with
additional sales channels. Advantage has license agreements with
fifteen independently owned associate offices
(“Associates”), which are responsible for selling and
marketing payroll services and performing certain operational
functions, while Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized
back-office payroll processing and tax filing services. In
addition, Advantage has a relationship with New England Business
Service, Inc. (“NEBS®”) whereby Advantage
performs all client functions other than sales and marketing.
The marketing and selling by both Associates and NEBS is
conducted under their respective logos.

Competition

The market for payroll processing and human resource services is
highly competitive and fragmented. The Company believes its
primary national competitor, ADP® (“Automatic Data
Processing, Inc.”), is the largest U.S. third-party
provider of payroll processing and human resource services in
terms of revenue. Paychex competes with other national,
regional, local, and online service providers, all of which it
believes have significantly smaller client bases than Paychex.



In addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource
service providers, the Company competes with in-house payroll
and human resource systems and departments. Payroll and human
resource systems and software are sold by many vendors. The
Company’s Human Resource and Benefits products and services
also compete with a variety of providers of human resource
services, such as retirement services companies, insurance
companies, and human resources and benefits consulting firms.

Competition in the payroll processing and human resource
services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness,
product quality and reputation, breadth of product and service
offering, and price. Paychex believes it is competitive in each
of these areas.

Software Maintenance and Development

The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local taxing
authorities require Paychex to regularly update the proprietary
software it utilizes to provide Payroll and Human Resource and
Benefits services to its clients. The Company is continually
engaged in developing enhancements to and maintenance of its
various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of
its clients and the marketplace.

Employees

As of May 31, 2005, the Company employed approximately
10,000 people. None of the employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements.

Intellectual Property

The Company owns or licenses and uses a number of trademarks,
trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer
programs and software, and other intellectual property rights.
Taken as a whole, the Company’s intellectual property
rights are material to the conduct of its business. Where it is
determined to be appropriate, the Company takes measures to
protect its intellectual property rights, including, but not
limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or
policies with employees, vendors and others, license agreements
with licensees and licensors of intellectual property, and
registration of certain trademarks. Paychex believes that the
“Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material
importance to the Company.

Seasonality

There is no significant seasonality to the Company’s
business. However, during the Company’s third fiscal
quarter, which ends in February, the number of new Payroll
clients, new Retirement Services clients, and new PAS and PEO
worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of
the fiscal year, primarily because a majority of new clients
begin using Paychex services in the beginning of a calendar
year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and
client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third
fiscal quarter due to clients paying year-end bonuses and
requesting additional year-end services. Historically, as a
result of these factors, the Company’s total revenue has
been slightly higher in the third fiscal quarter, with greater
sales commission expenses also reported in this quarter.

stockholder information, press releases, and filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) can be
found on the Company’s Web site at www.paychex.com. The
Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly

Relations section of such Web site as soon as reasonably

with its 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, will be made

Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations

The Company’s future results of operations are subject to a
number of risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties
could cause actual results to differ materially from historical
and current results and from Company projections. Important
factors known to the Company that could cause such differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those
contained in the “Safe Harbor” statement at the
beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K.

The Company may make errors and omissions in providing
services which could result in significant penalties and
liabilities for the Company:

Processing, tracking,
collecting, and remitting client funds to the various taxing
authorities, client employees, and other third parties are
complex operations. These tasks could be subject to error and
these errors could include, but are not limited to, late filing
with tax agencies, underpayment of taxes, and failure to comply
with applicable banking regulations and laws relating to
employee benefits administration, which could result in
significant penalties and liabilities that would adversely
affect the Company’s results of operations. The Company
could also transfer funds in error to an incorrect party or for
the wrong amount, and may be unable to correct the error or
recover the funds, resulting in a loss to the Company.

Changes in government regulations and policies could
adversely impact the business:

Many of the
Company’s services, particularly tax filing and payment
services and benefit plan administration services, are designed
according to government regulations that continue to change.
Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of
benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide
employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and
employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or
eliminate the need for some of the Company’s services and
substantially decrease its revenue. Added requirements could
also increase the Company’s cost of doing business. Failure
by the Company to modify its services in a timely fashion in
response to regulatory changes could have adverse effects on the
Company’s results of operations.

Failure of third-party service providers to perform their
functions could harm the Company’s business:

As
part of providing services to clients, Paychex relies on a
number of third-party service providers. These providers
include, but are not limited to, couriers used to deliver client
payroll checks and banks, which electronically transfer funds
from clients to their employees. Failure by these providers, for
any reason, to deliver their services in a timely manner could
result in material interruptions to Company operations, impact
client relations, and result in significant penalties or
liabilities to the Company.

Failure of the Company’s Business Continuity Plan in
the event of a catastrophe could result in the loss of client
data and adversely interrupt operations:

The
Company’s operations are dependent on its ability to
protect its infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or
natural disaster, security breach, power loss,
telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, or similar event.
The Company has a Business Continuity Plan in place in the event
of system failure due to any of these events. If the Business
Continuity Plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario,
the Company could potentially lose client data or experience
material adverse interruptions to its operations or delivery of
services to its clients.

Investments in new technology for the Company’s
internal use may not be implemented in a timely or
cost-effective manner which could impact the Company’s
results of operations:

To maintain its growth strategy,
the Company must adapt and respond to technological advances
offered by its competitors and technological requirements of its
clients. The Company has made significant investments related to
the development of new technologies for internal use. Such
technologies may not be implemented in a timely manner or within
targeted costs. Delays or difficulties in implementation or
added costs could impact the Company’s results of
operations.

Acquisitions may not provide anticipated benefits:

The effective integration of acquired companies may be difficult
to achieve. It is also possible that the Company may not realize
any or all expected benefits from acquisitions or achieve
benefits from acquisitions in a timely manner. In addition, the
Company may incur significant costs and management’s time
and attention may be diverted in connection with the integration
of acquisitions. Failure to effectively integrate future
acquisitions could affect the Company’s results of
operations. The Company currently has no definitive agreements
or current plans with respect to any material prospective
acquisitions.



The adverse outcome of legal matters could harm the
Company’s business:

The Company is subject to
various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course
of business. These include disputes related to breach of
contract, employment-related claims, and other matters. As of
May 31, 2005, the Company has a reserve of
$25.3 million for pending legal matters. See Item 3 of
this Form 10-K for additional disclosure. In light of the
legal reserve recorded, the Company’s management currently
believes that resolution of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position
or results of operations. However, these matters are subject to
inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that
their ultimate resolution could have a material adverse impact
on the Company’s financial position and results of
operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

Paychex clients could have insufficient funds to cover
payments the Company has made on their behalf to taxing
authorities and employees resulting in loss to the
Company:

As part of the payroll processing service,
Paychex is authorized by its clients to transfer money from
their bank accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and
various taxing authorities. It is possible that the Company
would be held liable for such amounts in the event the client
has insufficient funds to cover them. The Company has in the
past, and may in the future, make payments on its clients’
behalf for which it is not reimbursed, resulting in a loss to
the Company.

Interest earned on funds held for clients could be
impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the
amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance:

The
Company receives interest income from investing client funds
collected but not yet remitted to taxing authorities or to
client employees. A change in regulations either decreasing the
amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit
taxes to government authorities would adversely impact this
interest income.

The price of the Company’s stock may be volatile as a
result of factors and events that are beyond the Company’s
control:

The market price of the Company’s common
stock may be influenced by factors such as quarterly variations
in operating results, announcements of new services or
technological innovations by the Company or its competitors,
market conditions in the business process outsourcing industry,
changes in ratings or financial estimates by securities
analysts, general economic conditions, fluctuations in the stock
market that are not directly related to the Company’s
operating performance, and other factors and events that are
beyond the Company’s control. These and other factors can
lead to fluctuations in the price of the Company’s stock.

Item 2.

Properties

The Company’s headquarters are located at 911 Panorama
Trail South, Rochester, New York 14625 in a 140,000-square-foot
building complex owned by the Company. In addition, within the
Rochester area, the Company owns four facilities, which account
for a combined total of 501,000 square feet, and leases
approximately 69,000 square feet in two other office
complexes. These facilities house various distribution,
processing and technology functions, certain ancillary service
functions, a telemarketing unit, and other back office functions.

Outside of Rochester, New York, the Company leases approximately
1,882,000 square feet of space for its regional, branch,
and sales offices, and data processing centers at various
locations throughout the United States, concentrating on
major metropolitan areas. The Company owns branch facilities
located in Syracuse, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;
Auburn, Maine; and Rock Hill, South Carolina, which together
comprise approximately 105,000 square feet. The Company
leases approximately 9,000 square feet of space for offices
in Hamburg and Berlin, Germany. The Company believes that
adequate, suitable lease space will continue to be available for
its needs.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Contingencies:

The Company is subject to various
claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of its
business. These include disputes related to breach of contract,
employment-related claims, and other matters.

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Rapid Payroll,
Inc., are currently defendants in lawsuits pending in Los
Angeles Superior Court, the United States District Court for the
Central District of California, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the California Court of
Appeal, Second District all brought between calendar years 2002
and 2004 by licensees of payroll processing software owned by
Rapid Payroll.

In August 2001, Rapid Payroll informed seventy-six licensees
that it intended to stop supporting the software in August 2002.
Thereafter, lawsuits were commenced by licensees asserting
various claims, including breach of contract and related tort
and fraud causes of action. These lawsuits seek compensatory
damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief against Rapid
Payroll, the Company, the Company’s former Chief Executive
Officer and its Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. In
accordance with the Company’s indemnification agreements
with its senior executives, the Company will defend and, if
necessary, indemnify the individual defendants as it relates to
these pending matters.

On July 5, 2002, the federal district court entered a
preliminary injunction requiring that Rapid Payroll and the
Company continue to support and maintain the subject software
pursuant to the license agreements. In February 2005, the court
held that the preliminary injunction will be lifted on
April 30, 2006.

Court Rulings:

In September 2004, the Los Angeles
Superior Court granted certain post-trial motions in the

Payroll Partnership, L.P., et al. v. Rapid Payroll, Inc.
et al.

matter, reducing the jury’s June 2004
verdict against Rapid Payroll from $6.4 million to
$5.1 million. The Los Angeles Superior Court dismissed
all other claims against Rapid Payroll and all claims against
the Company and the individual defendants, including fraud and
tort causes of action. Subsequently, this case was settled for a
reduced amount.

On February 23, 2005, a tentative ruling was issued by a
Los Angeles Superior Court judge, following a bench trial of the

Accuchex, Inc. v. Rapid Payroll, Inc. et al.

matter. The court found that the limitation of liability clause
in the parties’ license agreement is valid and enforceable.
The court awarded Accuchex damages of $30.5 thousand plus a
refund of approximately $35.0 thousand in license fees. The
court rejected all of the other causes of action asserted by the
plaintiff. The court entered judgment in the Accuchex case in
April 2005. The plaintiff has filed a Notice of Appeal to the
California Court of Appeal, Second District.

On February 28 and March 1, 2005, the federal district
court entered judgment in thirteen of the cases pending before
it. Those judgments provide that Rapid Payroll’s liability
is limited by the license fees paid to it by the plaintiff
licensees, pursuant to express contractual provisions of the
license agreements. Those judgments also provide that Rapid
Payroll must support the licensed software until April 30,
2006, and, at that time, refund to each of the licensee
plaintiffs the license fees paid by that plaintiff. The license
fees received by Rapid Payroll under the agreements from these
thirteen licensee plaintiffs total approximately
$2.5 million. The federal court also ordered the release of
the source code pursuant to the escrow terms of the license
agreements. The federal court judgments also rejected the fraud
and other tort claims brought by those plaintiffs against all of
the defendants.

Through June 27, 2005, the Company has settled thirteen
cases discussed above for approximately $8.0 million.

Based on the application of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (“SFAS”) No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies,” the Company is required to record a reserve
if it believes an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount
of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated. The
Company’s legal reserve for all pending legal matters
totaled $25.3 million at May 31, 2005, and is included
in current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
legal reserve has been reduced in fiscal 2005 as actual
settlements and incurred professional fees have been charged
against the legal reserve.

In light of the legal reserve recorded, the Company’s
management currently believes that resolution of pending legal
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.
However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
there exists the possibility that



the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material
adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and the
results of operations in the period in which any such effect is
recorded.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations reviews our operating results for each
of the three fiscal years in the period ended May 31, 2005
(fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003), and our financial condition at
May 31, 2005. This review should be read in conjunction
with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the
related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the “Factors That
May Affect Future Results of Operations” section discussed
in Item 1 of this Form 10-K. Forward-looking
statements in this review are qualified by the cautionary
statement under the heading “Safe Harbor” Statement
under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
contained at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a leading national provider of comprehensive payroll and
integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing
solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. We have a broad
portfolio of products and services that allow our clients to
meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs, which
include:

Our strategy is focused on growing our client base, increasing
utilization of our ancillary services, and leveraging our
technological and operating infrastructure. We earn revenues
primarily through recurring fees



for services performed related to our products. Service revenues
are largely driven by the number of clients, utilization of
ancillary services, and checks or transactions per client per
pay period. We also earn interest on funds held for clients
between the time of collection from our clients and remittance
to the respective tax or regulatory agencies or client employees.

Fiscal 2005 was our fifteenth consecutive year of record total
revenues, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Our
financial results for fiscal 2005 included the following
highlights:

Our growth rates in fiscal 2005 were due to strong service
revenue growth of 12% and the impact of expense charges recorded
in fiscal 2004 related to pending legal matters. These expense
charges reduced diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004 by
approximately $0.06 per share.

During fiscal 2005, we began to see positive signs of economic
improvement, especially in the interest rate environment. The
Federal Reserve increased the Federal Funds rate by
200 basis points since June 2004 to 3.00% as of
May 31, 2005. Our combined interest on funds held for
clients and corporate investment income increased 3%
year-over-year for fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, our combined
portfolios earned an average rate of return of 2.2% compared
with 1.8% in fiscal 2004 and 2.5% in fiscal 2003. During fiscal
2004 and fiscal 2003, we were able to offset some of the impact
of lower interest rates by realizing gains on the sale of
available-for-sale securities of $19.1 million for fiscal
2004 and $17.8 million for fiscal 2003. This compares to
net realized gains of $0.2 million in fiscal 2005. The
impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed
in more detail in the “Market Risk Factors” section in
Item 7A of this Form 10-K.

We continue to make investments in our business as part of our
growth strategy. Some of these investments include the following:

Growing the client base and increasing utilization of
ancillary services:

Our client base increased to
approximately 522,000 clients at May 31, 2005. This
compares with approximately 505,000 clients at May 31,
2004, and approximately 490,000 clients at May 31, 2003.
Year-over-year client growth was approximately 3.5% for fiscal
2005, compared with 3.1% for fiscal 2004. Client growth
excluding the impact of the Advantage and InterPay, Inc.
(“InterPay”) acquisitions was approximately 6% for
fiscal 2005 and 7% for fiscal 2004.



We have continued to invest in our direct sales force, as we
believe there is opportunity for growth within our target market
of small- to medium-sized businesses. The approximate
composition of our direct sales force is summarized in the
following table:

We believe there are opportunities for growth within our current
client base, as well as with new clients, through increased
utilization of our payroll-related and human resource ancillary
services. Ancillary services effectively leverage the payroll
processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating
margin. Penetration of our tax filing and payment services and
our employee payment services has continued to increase, and
total 90% and 65%, respectively, at May 31, 2005. Our
client bases in the human resource and employee benefits areas
have continued to grow, as shown in the following table:

Acquired businesses:

During fiscal 2003, we
acquired two payroll service providers servicing small- to
medium-sized businesses in the United States. Advantage was
purchased on September 20, 2002 and InterPay was purchased
on April 1, 2003. Since the completion of the acquisitions,
we have integrated the sales force, branch operations, and
corporate support of these acquired businesses to provide
efficiencies in operations and services provided to our clients.
By November 2004, we had successfully converted all InterPay
clients to our Paychex software platforms and fully completed
the integration of InterPay. The Advantage payroll system is
being retained for the foreseeable future in order to service
clients affiliated with independently owned associate offices
and Advantage co-branded products.

In April 2004, we acquired substantially all the assets and
certain liabilities of Stromberg LLC (“Stromberg”).
This acquisition, along with the October 2003 acquisition of
Stromberg’s Time In A Box® product, has allowed us to
expand our product offering to include time and attendance
solutions and thus offer value-added products and services to
payroll and non-payroll clients.

Focus on customer service:

We have always focused
on customer service and maximizing client retention. Fiscal year
client retention is at record levels of slightly less than 80%
of our beginning client base. The most significant factor
contributing to our client losses is companies going out of
business.

At May 31, 2005, we maintained a strong financial position
with total cash and corporate investments of
$707.6 million. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing
operations. Cash flow from operations was $467.9 million in
fiscal 2005 and $389.9 million in fiscal 2004.
Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases,
and dividend payments from our operating activities. The
acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 and
Stromberg in fiscal 2004, were funded from our cash and
corporate investments. It is anticipated that current cash and
corporate investment balances, along with projected operating
cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital
purchases, and current dividend payments for the foreseeable
future.



For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal
years 2005, 2004, and 2003, and our financial position at
May 31, 2005, refer to the tables and analysis in the
“Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and
Capital Resources” sections of this Item 7 and the
discussion in the “Critical Accounting Policies”
section of this Item 7.

Outlook

Our current outlook for the full fiscal year ended May 31,
2006 is summarized as follows:

Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2006 are expected
to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million. The
expected increase in fiscal 2006 capital expenditures reflects
printing equipment, communication system upgrades, and branch
expansions. Fiscal 2006 depreciation expense is projected to be
in the range of $50 million to $55 million. In
addition, we project amortization of intangible assets for
fiscal 2006 to be in the range of $14 million to
$15 million.

Our projections are based on current economic and interest rate
conditions continuing with no significant changes. We estimate
that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest
rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at the
beginning of fiscal 2006 would be in the range of
$3.7 million to $4.2 million for fiscal 2006. The
total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate
investments) is expected to average approximately
$3.8 billion in fiscal 2006. Given current accounting
interpretations, in order to preserve the accounting treatment
on available-for-sale securities of recording market value
fluctuations through comprehensive income instead of through the
income statement, we do not expect to realize any losses in the
investment portfolios in fiscal 2006.

Revenues:

Our total service revenues are comprised
of revenues from the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits
services. Payroll service revenues are earned primarily from
payroll processing, tax filing and payment services, employee
payment services, and other ancillary services through either
our Core Payroll or Major Market Services. Human Resource and
Benefits service revenues are earned primarily from retirement
services, workers’ compensation insurance administration,
section 125 plan administration, Paychex Administrative
Services (“PAS”) and Professional Employer
Organization (“PEO”) services, and time and attendance
solutions.

Our total service revenues growth year-over-year was 12% for
fiscal 2005 and 19% for fiscal 2004. The year-over-year growth
in Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2005 was due to increased
utilization of our ancillary services, growth from within our
current client base, and price increases. The increase in
Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal
2003 was attributable to these same factors as well as the
acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003.

As of May 31, 2005, 90% of all clients utilized our tax
filing and payment services, compared with 89% at May 31,
2004, and 87% at May 31, 2003. We believe our client
utilization percentage of the tax filing and payment services is
near maturity. Our employee payment services were utilized by
65% of our clients at May 31, 2005, compared with 63% at
May 31, 2004, and 60% at May 31, 2003. More than 95%
of new clients purchase our tax filing and payment services and
more than 75% of new clients purchase our employee



payment services. Major Market Services revenues totaled
$177.7 million, $139.7 million, and
$101.7 million for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue growth of
27% for fiscal 2005 and 37% for fiscal 2004. Approximately
one-third of our new Major Market Services clients are
conversions from our Core Payroll service.

The increases in Human Resource and Benefits service revenues in
fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are primarily related to growth in
the number of clients utilizing Retirement Services products,
growth in client employees for PAS and PEO services, and the
benefit of revenue from the April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg
time and attendance solutions.

Retirement Services revenues totaled $91.4 million,
$78.4 million, and $66.4 million in fiscal 2005, 2004,
and 2003, respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue
growth of 17% and 18% for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. We
serviced over 33,000 and 29,000 Retirement Services clients at
May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

PAS is a combined package of services that include payroll,
employer compliance, human resource and employee benefits
administration, and risk management outsourcing designed to make
it easier for businesses to manage their payroll and benefit
costs. Our PEO service provides primarily the same services as
PAS, but with Paychex acting as a co-employer of the
client’s employees. The PEO service is available primarily
in the states of Florida and Georgia, where PEOs are more
prevalent. Sales of the PAS and PEO products have been strong,
with administrative fee revenues from these services increasing
39% and 34% for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our PAS and
PEO products serviced over 225,000 and 157,000 client employees
as of May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal
2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is the result of higher average
interest rates earned in fiscal 2005 and higher average
portfolio balances, offset by lower net realized gains on the
sales of available-for-sale securities. The increase in interest
on funds held for clients in fiscal 2004 is the result of higher
net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities
and higher average portfolio balances, offset by lower average
interest rates earned in fiscal 2004. The higher average
portfolio balances in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were
driven by organic client base growth and fiscal 2004 benefited
from our acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003.

Combined Operating and SG&A Expenses:

The
following table summarizes total combined operating and selling,
general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for
the fiscal year ended May 31:

Combined operating and selling, general, and administrative
expenses increased 10% in fiscal 2005 and 18% in fiscal 2004,
excluding the expense charge to increase legal reserve. These
increases are primarily the result of our investments in
personnel, information technology, and other costs to support
organic growth, and additional expenses as a result of our April
2004 acquisition of Stromberg. Our acquisitions of Advantage and
InterPay in fiscal 2003 contributed to the increases in expenses
in fiscal 2004. At May 31, 2005, we had approximately
10,000 employees compared with approximately 9,400 at
May 31, 2004, and 8,850 at May 31, 2003.



Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings,
furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software.
In addition to the impact from the 2003 acquisitions of
businesses, depreciation expense in fiscal 2004 was higher due
in part to the purchase of a 220,000-square-foot facility in
Rochester, New York, and the placement into service of our
$30.0 million consolidated data center, both of which
occurred during the first half of fiscal 2003. Amortization of
intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained
from our fiscal 2003 acquisitions. Other expenses include items
such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and
entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred
to support our business.

Operating Income:

Operating income year-over-year
growth was 23% for fiscal 2005 and 8% for fiscal 2004. The
increases in operating income in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are
attributable to the factors previously discussed. Operating
income growth in fiscal 2005 was impacted by the
$35.8 million expense charge for the reserve for pending
legal matters in fiscal 2004, net incremental PEO revenue of
$6.7 million in fiscal 2005 and $6.4 million in fiscal
2004, and $3.2 million of expense charges related to our
captive insurance company in fiscal 2005. Operating income
exclusive of interest on funds held for clients and these
unusual items increased approximately 15% for fiscal 2005 and
approximately 17% in fiscal 2004.

Investment Income, Net:

Investment income, net,
primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents
and investments in available-for-sale investment securities.
Investment income does not include interest on funds held for
clients, which is included in total revenues. The decrease in
investment income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is
mainly due to lower net realized gains on the sales of
available-for-sale securities and lower average interest rates
earned in fiscal 2005 on longer-term investments, offset by an
increase in average daily invested balances. The decrease in
investment income in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is
mainly due to a decrease in average daily invested balances,
lower average interest rates earned, and lower net realized
gains on the sales of available-for-sale investments. The
decrease in average daily invested balances in fiscal 2004 is
primarily the result of the sale of corporate investments to
fund our Advantage and InterPay acquisitions in fiscal 2003.

Income Taxes:

Our effective income tax rate was
32.5% in fiscal 2005, compared with 32.6% in fiscal 2004, and
32.0% in fiscal 2003. The increase in our effective income tax
rate in fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of lower levels of
tax-exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal
debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate
investment portfolios. See Note H of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of
this Form 10-K, for additional disclosures on income taxes.

Net Income:

Net income year-over-year growth was
22% for fiscal 2005 and 3% for fiscal 2004. The increases in net
income for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are attributable to the
factors previously discussed.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At May 31, 2005, our principal source of liquidity was
$707.6 million of cash and corporate investment balances.
Current cash and corporate investments and projected operating
cash flows are expected to support our normal business
operations, capital purchases, and current dividend payments for
the foreseeable future.

Our Credit Facilities are evidenced by Promissory Notes and are
secured by separate Pledge Security Agreements by and between
Paychex and each of the financial institutions (the
“Lenders”), pursuant to which we have granted each of
the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment
securities accounts.



The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account
pursuant to the terms of a Control Agreement and is to be
administered under an Intercreditor Agreement among the Lenders.
Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that
collateral be transferred from the pooled account into
segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from
electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the
ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were
outstanding against our lines of credit during fiscal 2005 or at
May 31, 2005.

We had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling
$53.1 million and $8.4 million at May 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively, required to secure commitments for
certain of our insurance policies. These letters of credit at
May 31, 2005, expire at various dates between December 2005
and July 2006. Included in the $53.1 million is a
$44.2 million letter of credit arrangement entered into in
fiscal 2005. The letters of credit are secured by securities
held in our corporate investment portfolios, including the
$44.2 million letter of credit for which funds have been
segregated into a separate account. No amounts were outstanding
on these letters of credit during fiscal 2005 or at May 31,
2005.

We have entered into various operating leases and purchase
obligations that, under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
at May 31, 2005. The table below summarizes our estimated
annual payment obligations under these commitments, as well as
other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2005:

Operating leases are primarily for office space and equipment
    used in our branch operations throughout the United States.
    These amounts do not include future payments under redundant
    leases related to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay,
    which are included in the table above with other liabilities.

(2)

Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum
    outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and
    services and legally binding contractual arrangements with
    future payment obligations. Included in the total purchase
    obligations is $13.7 million of commitments to purchase
    capital assets. Amounts actually paid under some of these
    arrangements may be higher due to variable components of these
    agreements.

(3)

The obligations shown as other liabilities are reflected in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2005, with
    $0.9 million in other current liabilities and
    $1.6 million in other long-term liabilities. Certain
    deferred compensation plan obligations and other long-term
    liabilities amounting to $32.3 million are excluded because
    the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or
    reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions
    required to project the timing of future payments.

Advantage has license agreements with fifteen independently
owned associate offices, which are responsible for selling and
marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain
operational functions, while Paychex and Advantage provide all
centralized back-office payroll processing and tax filing
services. In addition, Advantage has a relationship with NEBS
whereby Advantage performs all client functions other than sales
and marketing. Under these arrangements, Advantage pays the
Associates and NEBS commissions based on processing activity for
the related clients. Since the actual amounts of future payments
is uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not
included in the table above. Commission expense for the
Associates and NEBS in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was
$16.7 million and $14.4 million, respectively.



In the normal course of business, we make representations and
warranties that guarantee the performance of our services under
service arrangements with clients. In addition, we have entered
into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors,
which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these
individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they
relate to their services to Paychex and our subsidiaries.
Historically, there have been no material losses related to such
guarantees and indemnifications.

We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various
insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans.
Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements
is recorded in other current liabilities. Historically, the
amounts accrued have not been material. We have insurance
coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies
for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and
omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism, and
capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our
captive insurance company.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in
transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special
purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would
have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do
maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing
projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations.
These investments are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting.

The increase in our operating cash flows in fiscal 2005 and

items, impacted by cash from working capital. The increases in
non-cash adjustments to net income are primarily related to
higher depreciation and amortization on fixed and intangible
assets. In fiscal 2004, non-cash adjustments to net income were
also impacted by $35.8 million in expense charges to
increase the reserve for pending legal matters. The fluctuations
in our working capital between periods were primarily related to
the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection, and
timing of payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax,
and other liabilities.

Funds held for clients and corporate investments:

Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term
funds and available-for-sale debt securities. Corporate
investments are primarily comprised of



available-for-sale debt securities. The portfolio of funds held
for clients and corporate investments is detailed in Note D
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the
timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of
funds to tax authorities for tax filing and payment services and
to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services.
Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate
investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases,
sales, or maturities of corporate investments. During fiscal
2003, corporate investments were sold to fund the acquisitions
of Advantage and InterPay. Additional discussion of interest
rates and related risks is included in the “Market Risk
Factors” section included in Item 7A of this
Form 10-K.

Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired:

In fiscal 2005, we paid $0.4 million related to the
acquisition of Stromberg. In fiscal 2004, we paid approximately
$12.6 million in cash for the acquisition of Stromberg and
$0.6 million of additional purchase price related to the
InterPay acquisition. In fiscal 2003, we paid
$314.4 million in cash for the acquisition of Advantage and
$181.7 million in cash for the acquisition of InterPay.

Purchases of property and equipment:

To support
our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of
property and equipment were made for data processing equipment
and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various
operating facilities. In fiscal 2005, we made purchases of
property and equipment of $70.7 million, compared with
$50.6 million of purchases in fiscal 2004, and
$60.2 million in fiscal 2003. In May 2005, we purchased a
127,000-square-foot facility in Rochester, New York for
$10.5 million. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2003
include the purchase of a 220,000-square-foot facility in
Rochester, New York. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we
placed into service a consolidated data center to enhance data
processing and disaster recovery capabilities. Purchases for the
data center of data processing equipment, software, and building
improvements in fiscal 2003 were approximately
$12.2 million. Construction in progress totaled
$29.5 million and $10.9 million at May 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. A significant portion of these costs
represents software being developed for internal use.

During fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004, and fiscal 2003, we purchased
approximately $2.5 million, $1.2 million, and
$2.6 million, respectively, of data processing equipment
and software from EMC Corporation, whose President and Chief
Executive Officer is a member of our Board of Directors.

October 2003, our Board of Directors approved a 9.1% increase in
the quarterly dividend payment to $0.12 per share from
$0.11 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net
income totaled 52%, 59%, and 56% in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004,
and fiscal 2003, respectively. Future dividends are dependent on
our future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the
discretion of our Board of Directors.

Proceeds from exercise of stock options:

The
decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in
fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is primarily due to a
decrease in the number of shares exercised. The increase in
proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2004
compared with fiscal 2003 is primarily due to an increase in
both the average exercise price per share and the number of
shares exercised. Shares exercised in fiscal 2005 were
0.7 million compared with 1.3 million shares in fiscal
2004 and 0.8 million shares



in fiscal 2003. We have recognized a tax benefit from the
exercise of stock options of $4.5 million,
$10.2 million, and $5.5 million for fiscal 2005,
fiscal 2004, and fiscal 2003, respectively. This tax benefit
reduces the accrued income tax liability and increases
additional paid-in capital, with no impact on the expense amount
for income taxes. See Note G to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this
Form 10-K, for additional disclosures on our stock option
plans.

Other

New accounting pronouncements:

On
December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment,” which replaces
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.” This statement will require
that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, be recognized as compensation costs in
the financial statements based on their fair values. The pro
forma disclosure of the effect on net earnings and earnings per
share as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting
for stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123 is
contained in Note A to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K,
under the heading “Stock-based compensation costs.”
However, the calculation of compensation costs for share-based
payment transactions in accordance with SFAS No. 123R
may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under
SFAS No. 123. We are currently evaluating the new
standard and the models that may be used to calculate the
expense for future share-based payment transactions. The
effective date of SFAS No. 123R was delayed until
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We anticipate
adopting this standard for our fiscal year beginning
June 1, 2006.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
“Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB
Opinion No. 29,” which eliminates the exception from
fair value measurement for non-monetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. The statement defines a non-monetary exchange with
commercial substance as one in which the future cash flows of an
entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the
exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005. We will adopt this statement
as required, and we do not believe the adoption will have a
material effect on our results of operations or financial
position.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”) FIN 46(R)-5 “Implicit Variable
Interests under FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities.” FSP FIN 46(R)-5
provides guidance for a reporting enterprise that holds an
implicit variable interest in a variable interest entity
(“VIE”) and is also a related party to other variable
interest holders. This guidance requires that if the aggregate
variable interests held by the reporting enterprise and its
related parties would, if held by a single party, identify that
party as the primary beneficiary, then the party within the
related party group that is most closely associated with the VIE
is the primary beneficiary. The effective date of FSP
FIN 46(R)-5 is the first reporting period beginning after
March 3, 2005 with early application permitted for periods
for which financial statements have not been issued. We do not
believe that implementation of this FSP will have a material
effect on our results of operations or financial position.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” which
establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as
the required method for reporting a change in accounting
principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements
specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The
statement provides guidance for determining whether
retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is
impracticable. The statement also addresses the reporting of a
correction of error by restating previously issued financial
statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting
changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. We will adopt this statement as
required, and we do not believe the adoption will have a
material effect on our results of operations or financial
position.



Critical Accounting Policies

Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included
in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, discusses the significant
accounting policies of Paychex, Inc. Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based
upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and
assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the
accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the
Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on
historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions
believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances.
Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates.
Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our
results of operations or financial position are discussed below.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenues are
recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Certain processing services are provided under annual service
arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
service period. Our service revenues are largely attributable to
payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a
fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per
processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction
processed. The revenue earned on delivery service for the
distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is
included in service revenues, and the costs for delivery are
included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

PEO revenues are included in service revenues and are reported
net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages,
taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees.
Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees were
$2,230.8 million, $1,846.1 million, and
$1,460.7 million for fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively.

Revenues from certain time and attendance solutions are
recognized using the residual method when all of the following
are present: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
typically a non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for
the software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and
free of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in
conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance
solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is
recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
filing and payment services and for employee payment services,
and invested until remittance to the applicable tax agencies or
client employees. These collections from clients are typically
remitted between one and thirty days after receipt, with some
items extending to ninety days. The interest earned on these
funds is included in total revenues on the Consolidated
Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and
remittance of these funds are critical components of providing
these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
net realized gains and losses from the sales of
available-for-sale securities.

PEO workers’ compensation insurance:

Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to
provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by
us. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus
amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates
of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the
claims. In establishing the workers’ compensation insurance
reserves, we utilize an independent actuary. We do not discount
our reserves for workers’ compensation insurance claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes
in legal liability law and damage awards, all of which could
materially impact the reserves as reported in the financial
statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from
our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not
occur until well into the future.



We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’
compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously
established reserves are reflected in the operating results of
the period in which the adjustment is determined to be
necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant,
reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

In fiscal 2004, workers’ compensation insurance for PEO
worksite employees was provided under a pre-funded, deductible
workers’ compensation policy with a national insurance
company. In fiscal 2005, the policy was no longer pre-funded and
claims were paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims
liability was $500,000 under each of the fiscal 2004 and 2005
policies.

We had recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation claims as of
May 31:

Valuation of investments:

Our investments in debt
securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related
to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized
losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in
comprehensive income as reported on our Consolidated Statements
of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value
of investments impact our net income only when such investments
are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses
on the sale of securities are determined by specific
identification of the security’s cost basis. On our
Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses
from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds
held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from
corporate investments are included in investment income, net.

We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these
investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to
meet the terms of the bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by
investing primarily in high-credit-quality securities. We
periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any
investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in
credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would
require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such
determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate,
among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair
value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating
and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our
ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of
market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an
investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change
in the future due to new developments or changes in our
strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.

Goodwill and intangible assets:

For business
combinations, we assign estimated fair values to all assets and
liabilities acquired, including intangible assets such as
customer lists, certain license agreements, trade names, and
non-compete agreements. The assignment of fair values to
acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful
lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires
significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions. For certain
fixed assets, including software, and intangible assets, we
utilize the assistance of independent valuation consultants. The
remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned
to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

We have $406.0 million of goodwill recorded on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet at May 31, 2005, resulting from
acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004.
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” requires that goodwill not be amortized, but
instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim
periods if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to
indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair
value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by
comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its
carrying amount, including goodwill. We perform our annual
review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. Our
business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially
all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. Based
on the results of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment
charge was recognized in fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004. Subsequent
to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that
indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance.



We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable.

Accrual for client fund losses:

We maintain an
accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients’
inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of
providing payroll, tax filing and payment services, and employee
payment services, we are authorized by the client to initiate
money transfers from the client’s account for the amount of
tax obligations and employees’ direct deposits. Electronic
money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to
potential risk of loss resulting from clients’ insufficient
funds to cover such transfers. We evaluate certain uncollected
amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience
for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the
likelihood of recovery from the clients.

Contingent liabilities:

We are subject to various
claims and legal matters. During the third and fourth quarters
of fiscal 2004, we recorded $9.2 million and
$26.6 million, respectively, in expense charges to increase
the reserve for pending legal matters. At May 31, 2005,
approximately $25.3 million of our reserve for pending
legal matters remains. Based on the application of
SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,”
which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an
unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable
loss can be reasonably estimated, we deem this amount adequate.
The determination of whether any particular matter involves a
probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be
reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment. This
reserve may change in the future due to new developments or
changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any
particular matter. In light of the legal reserve recorded, we
currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have
a material adverse effect on our financial position or results
of operations. However, these matters are subject to inherent
uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate
resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact
on our financial position and our results of operations in the
period in which any such effect is recorded. For additional
information regarding pending legal matters refer to Note L
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in
Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Income taxes:

We account for deferred taxes by
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for
the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We
account for the tax benefit from the exercise of non-qualified
stock options by reducing our accrued income tax liability and
increasing additional paid-in capital.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

Market Risk Factors

Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:

Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term
funds and available-for-sale debt securities, and corporate
investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale debt
securities. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings
potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in
the market value of our longer-term available-for-sale
investments. We generally direct investments towards
high-credit-quality, fixed-rate municipal and government
securities and manage the available-for-sale portfolio to a
benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years. We do not
utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate
risk.

Our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios
have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates. The
Federal Funds rate has increased to 3.00% as of May 31,
2005. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005, the average
interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and
corporate investment portfolios was 2.2% compared with 1.8% for
the same period last year. Short-term interest rates rose
steadily throughout fiscal 2005, but longer-term rates, on
average, were basically unchanged from the end of fiscal 2004.
While short-term and long-term interest rates generally move in
the same direction, there are certain economic and liquidity
conditions that will affect this relationship. When interest
rates begin to rise, the full benefit of higher interest rates
will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the
interaction of long- and short-term interest rate changes as
discussed below. The Federal Funds rate decreased from 6.50% at
the end of fiscal 2000 to 1.00% at May 31, 2004. The
decreasing interest rate environment experienced



through fiscal 2004 negatively affected net income growth.
During most of fiscal 2004 and 2003, the decreasing rate
environment generated significant unrealized gains for our
longer-term available-for-sale portfolio. During fiscal 2004 and
fiscal 2003, we mitigated some of the impact of lower interest
rates on earnings by realizing gains from the sales of our
investments.

Increases in interest rates increase earnings from our
short-term investments, which totaled approximately
$1.4 billion at May 31, 2005, and over time will
increase earnings from our longer-term available-for-sale
investments, which totaled approximately $1.8 billion at
May 31, 2005. Earnings from the
available-for-sale-investments, which currently have an average
duration of 2.1 years, excluding the impact of auction rate
securities tied to short-term interest rates, will not reflect
increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or
mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates. An
increasing rate environment will generally result in a decrease
in the fair value of our investment portfolio.

The cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities at
May 31, 2005, by contractual maturity are shown below.
Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities

The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds
rate over the past three fiscal years:

On June 30, 2005, the Federal Funds rate was increased to
3.25%.

Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates
involves many factors. These factors include, but are not
limited to, daily interest rate changes, seasonal variations in
investment balances, actual duration of short-term and
available-for-sale investments, the proportional mix of taxable
and tax-exempt investments, and changes in tax-exempt municipal
rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not
synchronized or simultaneous. Subject to these factors, a
25-basis-point change generally affects our tax-exempt interest
rates by approximately 17 basis points.

The total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and
corporate investments) is expected to average approximately
$3.8 billion in fiscal 2006. Our normal and anticipated
allocation is approximately 60% invested in short-term
securities with an average duration of thirty days and 40%
invested in available-for-sale municipal securities with an
average duration of two and one-half to three years. We estimate
that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest
rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at the
beginning of fiscal 2006 would be in the range of
$3.7 million to $4.2 million for fiscal 2006.



The combined funds held for clients and corporate
available-for-sale investment portfolios reflected a net
unrealized loss of $9.9 million at May 31, 2005,
compared with a net unrealized loss of $4.2 million at
May 31, 2004, and a net unrealized gain of
$45.0 million at May 31, 2003. During fiscal 2005, the
net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from a net
unrealized loss of $14.4 million to a net unrealized gain
of $10.6 million. During fiscal 2004, the net unrealized
gain or loss position ranged from approximately
$7.6 million net unrealized loss to $49.6 million net
unrealized gain. The net unrealized loss position of our
investment portfolios was approximately $10.9 million at
July 19, 2005. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this
Form 10-K, for additional disclosures about our investment
portfolios.

As of May 31, 2005 and May 31, 2004, we had
$1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, invested
in available-for-sale securities at fair value, with
weighted-average yields to maturity of 2.6% and 2.3%,
respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both
short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis
points, the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our
portfolio of securities at May 31, 2005, would be in the
range of $7.5 million to $8.0 million. Conversely, a
corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a
comparable increase in fair value. This hypothetical decrease or
increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as
an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value, with an
offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity and with
no related or immediate impact on the results of operations.

Credit risk:

We are exposed to credit risk in
connection with these investments through the possible inability
of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. We attempt to
limit credit risk by investing primarily in AAA- and AA-rated
securities and A-1-rated short-term securities, and by limiting
amounts that can be invested in any single instrument. At
May 31, 2005, all available-for-sale and short-term
securities classified as cash equivalents held an A-1 or
equivalent rating, with over 98% of available-for-sale
securities holding an AA rating or better.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data




REPORT ON MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT ON EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Paychex, Inc. (the “Company”) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system
of internal control over financial reporting as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange
Act”). The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our internal control over
financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits
and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified
personnel, and a written Code of Business Conduct adopted by our
Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to all Company
Directors and all officers and employees of our Company.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
even when determined to be effective, can only provide
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

The Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors
meets with the independent public accountants, management, and
internal auditors periodically to discuss internal control over
financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting
matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent public
accountants the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit
Committee also meets periodically with the independent public
accountants and the chief internal auditor without management
present to ensure that the independent public accountants and
the chief internal auditor have free access to the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee’s Report can be found in the
Definitive Proxy Statement to be issued in connection with the
Company’s 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our
assessment, management believes that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
May 31, 2005.

The Company’s independent public accountants,
Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm,
are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board
of Directors. Ernst & Young LLP has audited and
reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Paychex,
Inc., management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting and the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. The reports of the independent public
accountants are contained in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Audit Committee of the Board of Directors

and the Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Paychex, Inc. as of May 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
May 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
Paychex, Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Paychex, Inc. at May 31,
2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended May 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Paychex, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of May 31, 2005, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
July 8, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Audit Committee of the Board of Directors

and the Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal
Control over Financial Reporting, that Paychex, Inc. (the
Company) maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of May 31, 2005, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Paychex Inc.’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment about
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Paychex, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of May 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
Paychex, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Paychex, Inc. as of May 31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended May 31, 2005, and our
report dated July 8, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Note A — Description of Business and
Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Paychex, Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a leading
national provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human
resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small-
to medium-sized businesses in the United States. The Company
also has a subsidiary in Germany, which opened its office in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company, a Delaware
corporation, reports one segment based upon the provision of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information.”

Total revenues are comprised of service revenues and interest on
funds held for clients. Service revenues are comprised of the
Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product and service
lines. Payroll service revenues are earned primarily from
payroll processing, tax filing and payment services, employee
payment services, and other ancillary services. Employee payment
services include the direct deposit, Readychex®, and Access
Card product lines.

Payroll processing services include the preparation of payroll
checks; internal accounting records; federal, state, and local
payroll tax returns; and collection and remittance of payroll
obligations for small- to medium-sized businesses.

In connection with the automated tax filing and payment
services, the Company collects payroll taxes electronically from
clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepares and
files the applicable tax returns, and remits taxes to the
appropriate taxing authorities on their due dates. These
collections from clients are typically paid between one and
thirty days after receipt, with some items extending to ninety
days. The Company handles all regulatory correspondence,
amendments, and penalty and interest disputes, and is subject to
cash penalties imposed by tax authorities for late filings and
late- or under-payment of taxes. With employee payment services,
employers are offered the option of paying their employees by
direct deposit, Access Card, a check drawn on a Paychex account
(Readychex®), or a check drawn on the employer’s
account. For the first three methods, net payroll is collected
electronically from the client’s bank account typically one
day before the payroll date and provides payment to the employee
on payday. In connection with both the tax filing and payment
and employee payment services, authorized electronic money
transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential
risk of loss resulting from insufficient funds to cover such
transfers.

In addition to service fees paid by clients, the Company earns
interest on funds held for clients that are collected before due
dates and invested until remittance to the applicable tax
authorities or client employees. The funds held for clients and
related client deposit liability are included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as current assets and current
liabilities. The amount of funds held for clients and related
client deposit liability varies significantly during the year.

The Human Resource and Benefits product and service line
provides small- to medium-sized businesses with retirement
services, workers’ compensation insurance administration,
section 125 plan administration, group benefits, and state
unemployment insurance. The Company’s Paychex
Administrative Services (“PAS”) product provides a
combined package of payroll, employer compliance, employee
benefits administration, and risk management outsourcing
services designed to make it easier for businesses to manage
their payroll and related benefits costs. The Company also
operates a Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”),
which provides primarily the same package of services as the PAS
product, but with Paychex acting as a co-employer of the
client’s employees. The Company makes available time and
attendance solutions to larger companies, and offers solutions
to small- to medium-sized businesses through Time In A Box®.

Principles of consolidation:

The Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of Paychex, Inc. and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.



PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash and cash
equivalents consist of available cash, money market securities,
and other investments with a maturity of three months or less
when purchased. Amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets approximate fair value.

Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful
accounts:

Accounts receivable balances are shown on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance for doubtful
accounts of $2.5 million and $3.3 million at
May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Amounts reported in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair values. No
single client has a material impact on total accounts
receivable, service revenues, or results of operations.

Funds held for clients and corporate investments:

Marketable securities included in funds held for clients and
corporate investments consist primarily of debt securities
classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value
obtained from an independent pricing service. Funds held for
clients also include cash, money market securities, and
short-term investments. Unrealized gains and losses, net of
applicable income taxes, are reported as accumulated other
comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity. Realized gains and losses on the
sales of securities are determined by specific identification of
the cost basis of each security. On the Consolidated Statements
of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients
are included in interest on funds held for clients and realized
gains and losses from corporate investments are included in
investment income, net.

Concentrations:

Substantially all of the
Company’s deposited cash is maintained at two large
credit-worthy financial institutions. These deposits may exceed
the amount of any insurance provided. All of the Company’s
deliverable securities are held in custody with one of the two
aforementioned financial institutions, for which that
institution bears the risk of custodial loss. Non-deliverable
securities, primarily time deposits and money market securities,
are restricted to credit-worthy broker-dealers and financial
institutions.

Property and equipment, net of accumulated
depreciation:

Property and equipment is stated at cost,
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
based on the estimated useful lives of property and equipment
using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of
depreciable assets are generally ten to thirty-five years for
buildings and improvements, two to seven years for data
processing equipment, three to five years for software, seven
years for furniture and fixtures, and two to ten years for
leasehold improvements. Normal and recurring repair and
maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. The
Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment,
including capitalized software, for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
such assets may not be recoverable.

Software development and enhancements:

Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed
for internal use are capitalized and depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets, which are generally three to five years. For
software developed for internal use, all external direct costs
for materials and services and certain payroll and related
fringe benefit costs are capitalized in accordance with
Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use.”

Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated
amortization:

The Company has recorded goodwill in
connection with the acquisitions of businesses during fiscal
2003 and fiscal 2004, which are discussed in Note B of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the provisions
of SFAS No. 142, goodwill is tested for impairment on
an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change in a way to indicate a potential decline in
the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined
by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its
carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company’s business
is largely homogeneous, and as a result, substantially all the
goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. The Company
performs its annual impairment testing at the beginning of



PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the fourth fiscal quarter. Based on the Company’s review,
no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations
for fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004.

Intangible assets are primarily comprised of client list
acquisitions and license agreements with independently owned
associate offices and are reported net of accumulated
amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Intangible
assets are amortized over periods generally ranging from five to
twelve years using either straight-line or accelerated methods.
The Company tests intangible assets for impairment when events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable.

Other long-term assets:

Other long-term assets are
primarily related to the Company’s investment as a limited
partner in various low-income housing partnerships. These
partnerships were determined to be variable interest entities as
defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46
(“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities.” The Company is not the primary
beneficiary of these variable interest entities and, therefore,
does not consolidate them in the Company’s results of
operations and financial position. The investments in these
partnerships are accounted for under the equity method, with the
Company’s share of partnership losses recorded in
investment income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The net investment in these entities recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets was $5.2 million at
May 31, 2005, and $6.1 million at May 31, 2004.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenues are
recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Certain processing services are provided under annual service
arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
service period. The Company’s service revenues are largely
attributable to payroll-related processing services where the
fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed
amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or
transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service
for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and
reports is included in service revenues, and the costs for the
delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

PEO revenues are included in service revenues and are reported
net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages,
taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees.
Direct costs billed and incurred were $2,230.8 million,
$1,846.1 million, and $1,460.7 million for fiscal
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Revenues from certain time and attendance solutions are
recognized using the residual method when all of the following
are present: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
typically a non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for
the software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and
free of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by the
Company’s clients in conjunction with their purchase of the
time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these maintenance
contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
filing and payment services and for employee payment services,
and invested until remittance to the applicable tax agencies or
client employees. These collections from clients are typically
remitted between one and thirty days after receipt, with some
items extending to ninety days. The interest earned on these
funds is included in total revenues on the Consolidated
Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and
remittance of these funds are critical components of providing
these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
net realized gains and losses from the sales of
available-for-sale securities.

Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. (“Advantage”) has
license agreements with fifteen independently owned associate
offices (“Associates”) which the Company became a
party to upon the acquisition of Advantage in September 2002.
The Associates are responsible for selling and marketing
Advantage services and performing certain operational functions.
Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized back-office



PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

payroll processing and tax filing services for the Associates,
including the billing and collection of processing fees and the
collection and remittance of payroll and payroll tax funds
pursuant to Advantage’s service arrangement with Associate
customers. The marketing and selling by the Associates is
conducted under their respective logos. Commissions earned by
the Associates are based on the processing activity for the
related clients. Revenue generated from customers as a result of
these relationships and commissions paid to Associates are
included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as service
revenues and selling, general, and administrative expense,
respectively.

PEO workers’ compensation insurance:

Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to
provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by
the Company. These reserves include estimates for reported
losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported
and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and
settling the claims. In establishing the workers’
compensation insurance reserves, the Company utilizes an
independent actuary. The Company does not discount its reserves
for workers’ compensation insurance claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes
in legal liability law and damage awards, all of which could
materially impact the reserves as reported in the financial
statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from
the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not
occur until well into the future.

The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated
workers’ compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to
previously established reserves are reflected in the operating
results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to
be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant,
reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

In fiscal 2004, workers’ compensation insurance for PEO
worksite employees was provided under a pre-funded, deductible
workers’ compensation policy with a national insurance
company. In fiscal 2005, the policy was no longer pre-funded and
claims were paid as incurred. The Company’s maximum
individual claims liability was $500,000 under each of the
fiscal 2004 and 2005 policies.

The Company had recorded the following amounts on its
Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation
claims as of May 31:

Other insurance:

The Company’s captive
insurance company provides insurance coverage to Paychex in
addition to primary insurance policies purchased by Paychex.
This coverage provided includes gap coverage for employment
practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability,
and acts of terrorism, and capacity for deductibles and
self-insured retentions.

Income taxes:

The Company accounts for deferred
taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for
the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The
Company accounts for the tax benefit from the exercise of
non-qualified stock options by reducing its accrued income tax
liability and increasing additional paid-in capital.

Stock-based compensation costs:

SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” establishes accounting and reporting
standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. As
permitted by



PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 123, the Company accounts for such
arrangements under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants
because the exercise price of the stock options equals the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant.

The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net
income and earnings per share as if the Company had applied the
fair value recognition provision of SFAS No. 123 to
stock-based compensation:

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value
of the stock option is amortized to expense over the
option’s vesting period. The weighted-average fair value of
stock options granted for the years ended May 31, 2005,
2004, and 2003 was $9.02, $9.61, and $8.66 per share,
respectively. The fair value of these stock options was
estimated at the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

Additional information related to the Company’s stock
option plans is detailed in Note G of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates,
judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual amounts and results could differ from these
estimates.

New accounting pronouncements:

On
December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment,” which replaces
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” This
statement will require that all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, be
recognized as compensation costs in the financial statements
based on their fair values. The pro forma disclosure of the
effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if the Company
had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation under SFAS No. 123 is contained in this
Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the
heading “Stock-based compensation

costs.” However, the calculation of compensation costs for
share-based payment transactions in accordance with
SFAS No. 123R may be different from the calculation of
compensation cost under SFAS No. 123. The Company is
currently evaluating the new standard and the models that may be
used to calculate the expense for future share-based payment
transactions. The effective date of this Statement was delayed
until fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The
Company anticipates adopting this standard for its fiscal year
beginning June 1, 2006.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
“Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB
Opinion No. 29,” which eliminates the exception from
fair value measurement for non-monetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. The statement defines a non-monetary exchange with
commercial substance as one in which the future cash flows of an
entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the
exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt this
statement as required, and management does not believe the
adoption will have a material effect on its results of
operations or financial position.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”) FIN 46(R)-5 “Implicit Variable
Interests under FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities.” FSP FIN 46(R)-5
provides guidance for a reporting enterprise that holds an
implicit variable interest in a variable interest entity
(“VIE”) and is also a related party to other variable
interest holders. This guidance requires that if the aggregate
variable interests held by the reporting enterprise and its
related parties would, if held by a single party, identify that
party as the primary beneficiary, then the party within the
related party group that is most closely associated with the VIE
is the primary beneficiary. The effective date of FSP
FIN 46(R)-5 is the first reporting period beginning after
March 3, 2005 with early application permitted for periods
for which financial statements have not been issued. The Company
does not believe that implementation of this FSP will have a
material effect on its results of operations or financial
position.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” which
establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as
the required method for reporting a change in accounting
principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements
specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The
statement provides guidance for determining whether
retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is
impracticable. The statement also addresses the reporting of a
correction of error by restating previously issued financial
statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting
changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. The Company will adopt this
statement as required, and management does not believe the
adoption will have a material effect on its results of
operations or financial position.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have
been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on reported consolidated
earnings, and include the reclassification of auction rate
securities to available-for-sale from cash equivalents, within
the funds held for clients on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Auction rate securities are variable rate and tied to short-term
interest rates with maturities in excess of 90 days.
Interest rates on these securities reset through a modified
Dutch auction, at predetermined short-term intervals, usually
every 7, 28, 35 or 49 days. Interest paid during a
given period is based upon the interest rate determined during
the prior auction. Although these securities are issued and
rated as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as
short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through
the interest rate reset. The Company had historically classified
these instruments as cash equivalents within the funds held for
clients if the period between interest rate resets was
90 days or less.

Based upon the Company’s re-evaluation of the maturity
dates associated with the underlying bonds, the Company has
reclassified its auction rate securities, previously classified
as cash equivalents, to available-for-

sale securities within the funds held for clients for each of
the periods presented in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets. In addition, “Purchases of available-for-sale
securities”, “Proceeds from sales and maturities of
available-for-sale securities”, and “Net change in
funds held for clients’ money market securities and other
cash equivalents”, included in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, have been revised to
reflect the purchase and sale of auction rate securities during
the periods presented.

Note B — Business Combinations

Fiscal 2003 acquisitions:

In fiscal 2003, Paychex
acquired two comprehensive payroll processors that serviced
small- to medium-sized businesses throughout the United States.
On September 20, 2002, the Company acquired Advantage for
$314.4 million in cash including the redemption of
preferred stock and the repayment of outstanding debt of
Advantage. On April 1, 2003, Paychex acquired InterPay,
Inc. (“InterPay”), a wholly owned subsidiary of
FleetBoston Financial Corporation (“Fleet®”), for
$182.3 million in cash.

Purchase price allocations:

The cost to acquire
Advantage and InterPay has been allocated to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed according to estimated fair values at
the respective dates of the acquisition. During fiscal year
2004, the Company recorded adjustments to the estimated fair
values and for additional purchase price required, which
increased goodwill by $0.4 million. The following table
summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed for each of the acquired entities.

As a result of these acquisitions, the Company has recorded
reserves for severance and redundant lease costs in the
allocation of purchase price under Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection With a Purchase Combination.” The purchase price
allocation for the acquisitions included reserves of
$10.0 million for severance and $5.9 million for
redundant lease costs. Activity for the fiscal year ended
May 31, 2005 for these reserves is summarized as follows:

The severance payments for these acquisitions were substantially

lease payments are expected to be complete in the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2007, with the remaining payments extending
until 2015. Payments of $1.6 million extend beyond one year
and are included in other long-term liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2005.

The amount of goodwill allocated to the Advantage purchase price
was $241.8 million, which is not deductible for tax
purposes. The amount of goodwill allocated to the InterPay
purchase price was

$152.2 million, nearly all of which is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes as an acquisition under the
section 338(h)(10) tax election.

Pro forma financial information:

The following
table sets forth the unaudited pro forma results of operations
of the Company for the year ended May 31, 2003. The
unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the results
of operations for the periods indicated as if the Advantage and
InterPay acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the
annual period presented. The pro forma information contains the
actual combined operating results of Paychex, Advantage, and
InterPay, with the results prior to the acquisition date
adjusted to include the pro forma impact of: the amortization of
acquired intangible assets, the elimination of Advantage’s
interest expense and preferred stock dividends, and lower
interest income as a result of the sale of available-for-sale
securities to fund the two acquisitions. The Company realized a
total of $10.5 million of gains related to the sale of
corporate investments to fund the acquisitions. These gains are
included in the pro forma period presented as if they occurred
at the beginning of that period. These pro forma amounts do not
purport to be indicative of the results that would have actually
been obtained if the acquisitions occurred as of the beginning
of each of the periods presented or that may be obtained in the
future.

Fiscal 2004 acquisition:

During fiscal 2004, the
Company expanded its product offerings to include time and
attendance solutions. Effective April 12, 2004, Paychex
acquired substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of
Stromberg LLC (“Stromberg”), a provider of time and
attendance solutions for medium- to large-sized businesses, for
approximately $13.6 million. The Company paid
$12.6 million at the date of acquisition and paid an
additional $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005. The balance of $0.6 million is subject to adjustment,
and payment will not be determined until after May 31,
2005. Paychex had purchased Stromberg’s Time In A Box®
product, a time and attendance solution for small- to
medium-sized businesses, in October 2003. The purchase price was
allocated to the assets and liabilities of Stromberg based on
their fair values as follows:

Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:

Weighted-average anti-dilutive stock options to purchase shares
of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share. These options had an exercise price that was
greater than the average market price of the common shares for
the period; therefore, the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Note D — Funds Held for Clients and Corporate
Investments

Funds held for clients and corporate investments at May 31,
2005 and 2004 are as follows:



PAYCHEX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company is exposed to credit risk from the possible
inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. In
addition, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk, as rate
volatility will cause fluctuations in the market value of held
investments and the earnings potential of future investments.
The Company attempts to limit these risks by investing primarily
in AAA- and AA-rated securities and A-1-rated short-term
securities, limiting amounts that can be invested in any single
instrument, and by investing in short- to intermediate-term
instruments whose market value is less sensitive to interest
rate changes. At May 31, 2005, all short-term securities
classified as cash equivalents and all available-for-sale
securities held at least an A-1 or equivalent rating, with over
98% of the available-for-sale bond securities holding an AA
rating or better. The Company does not utilize derivative
financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.

The change in the net unrealized loss position of the

2004 to May 31, 2005 resulted from increases in long-term
market interest rates. The gross unrealized losses at
May 31, 2005 were comprised of 327 available-for-sale
securities, which had a total fair value of
$1,211.5 million. The gross unrealized losses at
May 31, 2004 were comprised of 257 available-for-sale
securities with a total fair value of $876.0 million. The

The Company reviews its investment portfolios on an ongoing
basis to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily
impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential
valuation concerns. At May 31, 2005, the Company believed
that the investments it held were not other-than-temporarily
impaired. While certain available-for-sale debt securities had
fair values that were below cost, the Company believed that it
was probable that the principal and interest would be collected
in accordance with contractual terms, and that the decline in
the market value was due to changes in interest rates and was
not due to increased credit risk. At May 31, 2005 and
May 31, 2004, substantially all of the securities in an
unrealized loss position held an AA rating or better. The
Company currently believes that it has the ability and intent to
hold these investments until the earlier of market price
recovery or maturity. The Company’s assessment that an
investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change
in the future due to new developments or changes in the
Company’s strategies or assumptions related to any
particular investment.

Note G — Stock Option Plans

The Company’s 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2002
Plan”) became effective on October 17, 2002 upon its
approval by the Company’s stockholders. The 2002 Plan
authorizes the granting of options to purchase up to
9.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock, of
which 1.6 million shares were authorized by the
stockholders for the Paychex, Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan
(the “1998 Plan”), but were not optioned under the
1998 Plan, and 7.5 million shares that were newly
authorized for options. At May 31, 2005, there were
3.9 million shares available for future grants under the
2002 Plan.

No future grants will be made pursuant to the 1998 Plan or the
1995 Stock Incentive Plan, which expired in August 1998 and
1995, respectively. However, options to purchase an aggregate of
6.2 million shares under these two plans remain outstanding
at May 31, 2005.

The exercise price for the shares subject to options of the
Company’s common stock is equal to the fair market value on
the date of the grant. All stock option grants have a
contractual life of ten years from the date of the grant.
Non-qualified stock option grants vest at 33.3% after two years
of service from the date of the grant, with annual vesting at
33.3% thereafter.

Note K — Employee Benefit Plans

401(k) Plans:

The Company maintains contributory
savings plans that qualify under section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The Paychex, Inc. 401(k) Incentive
Retirement Plan allows all employees to immediately participate
in the salary deferral portion of the Plan, contributing up to a
maximum of 50% of their salary. Employees who have completed one
year of service are eligible to receive a company matching
contribution. The Company currently matches 50% of an
employee’s voluntary contribution up to 6% of a
participant’s gross wages.

This Plan is 100% participant-directed. Plan participants can
fully diversify their portfolios by choosing from any or all
investment fund choices in the Plan. Transfers in and out of
investment funds, including the Paychex, Inc. ESOP Stock Fund,
are not restricted in any manner. The Company match contribution
follows the same fund elections as the employee compensation
deferrals.

Effective April 15, 2002, the Plan was amended to add an
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) feature to the
Paychex Stock Fund under section 404(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Under this ESOP feature, participants have voting
rights for their ownership of Paychex stock within the Plan.
Participants are able to elect to receive dividends on their
shares of Paychex stock in the form of cash or have them
reinvested into the Paychex Stock Fund.

On February 28, 2003, the Advantage Business Services
Holdings, Inc. 401(k) Incentive Plan was terminated and the
assets were merged into the Paychex, Inc. 401(k) Incentive
Retirement Plan. On January 2, 2004, the InterPay, Inc.
401(k) Retirement Plan was terminated and the assets were merged
into the Paychex, Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan.

Company contributions to the 401(k) plans for the years ended
May 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $7.9 million,
$7.1 million, and $6.3 million, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans:

The Company offers a
non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan to a select group of
key employees that provides these employees with the opportunity
to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and bonus. This
Plan also allows non-employee directors to defer 100% of their
Board compensation. The amounts accrued under this Plan were
$5.4 million and $4.5 million at May 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, and are reflected in other long-term
liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Prior to the April 1, 2003 acquisition, InterPay entered
into various salary continuation agreements with certain former
employees. These agreements provide for benefits to these
retired employees, and in certain cases to their beneficiaries,
for life or other designated periods through 2015. The amounts
accrued under these agreements were $1.8 million and
$1.9 million at May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
and represent the estimated present value of the benefits earned
under these agreements.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

The Company offers
an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible employees
may purchase common stock of the Company at current market
prices. All transactions occur directly through the
Company’s transfer agent and no brokerage fees are charged
to employees, except for when stock is sold.

The Credit Facilities are evidenced by Promissory Notes and are
secured by separate Pledge Security Agreements by and between
Paychex and each of the financial institutions (the
“Lenders”), pursuant to which the Company has granted
each of the Lenders a security interest in certain investment
securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
custody account pursuant to the terms of a Control Agreement and
is to be administered under an Intercreditor Agreement among the
Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may
require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account
into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual
Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from
electronic payment transactions on behalf of clients in the
ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were
outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2005 or
at May 31, 2005.

Letters of credit:

The Company had standby letters
of credit outstanding totaling $53.1 million and
$8.4 million at May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies.
These letters of credit at May 31, 2005, expire at various
dates between December 2005 and July 2006. Included in the
$53.1 million is a $44.2 million letter of credit
arrangement entered into in fiscal 2005. The letters of credit
are secured by securities held in the Company’s corporate
investment portfolios, including the $44.2 million letter
of credit for which funds have been segregated into a separate
account. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit
during fiscal 2005 or at May 31, 2005.

Contingencies:

The Company is subject to various
claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of its
business. These include disputes related to breach of contract,
employment-related claims, and other matters.

The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Rapid Payroll,
Inc., are currently defendants in lawsuits pending in Los
Angeles Superior Court, the United States District Court for the
Central District of California, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the California Court of
Appeal, Second District all brought between calendar years 2002
and 2004 by licensees of payroll processing software owned by
Rapid Payroll.

In August 2001, Rapid Payroll informed seventy-six licensees
that it intended to stop supporting the software in August 2002.
Thereafter, lawsuits were commenced by licensees asserting
various claims, including breach of contract and related tort
and fraud causes of action. These lawsuits seek compensatory
damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief against Rapid
Payroll, the Company, the Company’s former Chief Executive
Officer and its Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. In
accordance with the Company’s indemnification agreements
with its senior executives, the Company will defend and, if
necessary, indemnify the individual defendants as it relates to
these pending matters.

On July 5, 2002, the federal district court entered a
preliminary injunction requiring that Rapid Payroll and the
Company continue to support and maintain the subject software
pursuant to the license agreements. In February 2005, the court
held that the preliminary injunction will be lifted on
April 30, 2006.

Court Rulings:

In September 2004, the Los Angeles
Superior Court granted certain post-trial motions in the

Payroll Partnership, L.P., et al. v. Rapid Payroll,
Inc. et al.

matter, reducing the jury’s June 2004
verdict against Rapid Payroll from $6.4 million to
$5.1 million. The Los Angeles Superior Court dismissed
all other claims against Rapid Payroll and all claims against
the Company and the individual defendants, including fraud and
tort causes of action. Subsequently, this case was settled for a
reduced amount.

On February 23, 2005, a tentative ruling was issued by a
Los Angeles Superior Court judge, following a bench trial of the

Accuchex, Inc. v. Rapid Payroll, Inc. et al.

matter. The court found that the limitation of liability clause
in the parties’ license agreement is valid and enforceable.
The court awarded Accuchex damages of $30.5 thousand plus a
refund of approximately $35.0 thousand in license fees. The
court rejected all of the other causes of action asserted by the
plaintiff. The court entered judgment in the Accuchex case in
April 2005. The plaintiff has filed a Notice of Appeal to the
California Court of Appeal, Second District.

On February 28 and March 1, 2005, the federal district
court entered judgment in thirteen of the cases pending before
it. Those judgments provide that Rapid Payroll’s liability
is limited by the license fees paid to it by the plaintiff
licensees, pursuant to express contractual provisions of the
license agreements. Those judgments also provide that Rapid
Payroll must support the licensed software until April 30,
2006, and, at that time, refund to each of the licensee
plaintiffs the license fees paid by that plaintiff. The license
fees received by Rapid Payroll under the agreements from these
thirteen licensee plaintiffs total approximately
$2.5 million. The federal court also ordered the release of
the source code pursuant to the escrow terms of the license
agreements. The federal court judgments also rejected the fraud
and other tort claims brought by those plaintiffs against all of
the defendants.

Through June 27, 2005, the Company has settled thirteen
cases discussed above for approximately $8.0 million.

Based on the application of SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies,” the Company is
required to record a reserve if it believes an unfavorable
outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be
reasonably estimated. The Company’s legal reserve for all
pending legal matters totaled $25.3 million at May 31,
2005, and is included in current liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The legal reserve has been reduced in fiscal
2005 as actual settlements and incurred professional fees have
been charged against the legal reserve.

In light of the legal reserve recorded, the Company’s
management currently believes that resolution of pending legal
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.
However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of
these matters could have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s financial position and the results of operations
in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

Lease commitments:

The Company leases office space
and data processing equipment under terms of various operating
leases, with most data processing equipment leases containing a
purchase option at prices representing the fair value of the
equipment at expiration of the lease term. Rent expense for the
years ended May 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 was
$35.9 million, $37.7 million, and $36.6 million,
respectively. At May 31, 2005, future minimum lease
payments under various non-cancelable operating leases with
terms of more than one year are as follows:

The amounts shown above for operating leases include obligations

Other commitments:

At May 31, 2005, the
Company had outstanding commitments under purchase orders and
legally binding contractual arrangements with minimum future
payment obligations of approximately $63.9 million,
including $13.7 million of commitments to purchase capital
assets.

In the normal course of business, the Company makes
representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of
the Company’s services under service arrangements with
clients. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements
with its officers and directors, which require the Company to
defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for
certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their
services to Paychex and its subsidiaries. Historically, there
have been no material losses related to such guarantees and
indemnifications.

Paychex currently self-insures the deductible portion of various
insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. The
Company’s estimated loss exposure under these insurance
arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities.
Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material. The
Company maintains insurance coverage in addition to its
purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for
employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty
liability, and acts of terrorism, and capacity for deductibles
and self-insured retentions through its captive insurance
company.

Note M — Related Parties

During fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company purchased
approximately $2.5 million, $1.2 million, and
$2.6 million, respectively, of data processing equipment
and software from EMC Corporation, whose President and Chief
Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Directors of
Paychex.
