Item 1.  Business.
         ---------

General

Paychex, Inc. (the "Company" or "Paychex"), a Delaware corporation, was
formed in 1979 through the consolidation of 17 corporations engaged in
providing computerized payroll accounting services.

Principal Products, Services and Markets.
- -----------------------------------------

Paychex is primarily engaged in providing computerized payroll accounting
services to over 234,000 small to medium sized businesses nationwide.
Paychex believes that in number of clients it is the second largest payroll
accounting service company in the country.  The Company prepares and
furnishes paychecks, earnings statements and internal accounting records such
as journals, summaries and earnings histories.  Paychex prepares for its
clients all required monthly, quarterly and annual payroll tax returns for
federal, state and local governments.  The TAXPAY  feature is utilized by
over 55% of its' clients nationwide.  This service provides automatic payment
of payroll taxes and electronic filing of quarterly and annual tax returns.
Paychex also provides enhanced payroll services, including an automatic
salary deposit service (Direct Deposit) which electronically transmits the
net payroll for client's employees to banks throughout the Federal Reserve
System.  In addition, a digital check signing and inserting service is
offered.

Paylink, a proprietary software package, enables clients to use their
personal computers and modems to transmit their own payroll data into the
local Paychex processing center at any time without assistance of a payroll
specialist.  Currently over 13,800 clients use this feature.

Paychex markets its services principally to small and medium sized businesses
through its 75 branch operating centers and 23 sales offices located in major
metropolitan areas.  The Company's market share in branch processing center
territories ranges from 1% to approximately 20%.  No client accounts for as
much as 1% of the Company's revenue.

Clients may discontinue Paychex service at will.  Approximately 80% of the
businesses which were clients in fiscal year 1994 or 1995 continued to be
clients in the succeeding fiscal year.  Ownership changes or business
failures common to small businesses are the primary causes of client loss.

The Company warrants its services, agreeing to reimburse any client for
penalties and interest incurred as a result of a Paychex error.  Warranty
expense paid in fiscal years 1996 and 1995 was approximately $800,000 and
$410,000, respectively.

The Company employs payroll specialists who communicate primarily by
telephone with their assigned clients each payroll period to record the
hours worked by each employee and any personnel or compensation changes.
These specialists are trained by Paychex in all facets of payroll
preparation and applicable tax regulations. All information furnished by a
client is handled by someone who is "payroll intelligent" and familiar
with that client's payroll.

The Paychex payroll system is an on-line, direct entry computer system which
enables the payroll specialist to simultaneously enter information from the
client while receiving it over the telephone.  Payroll processing is
decentralized in the Company's branch operating centers while Taxpay
and Direct Deposit processing are centralized at the Company's headquarters.
Sales offices utilize a nearby Company branch operating center for processing.

While payroll is its core business, Paychex also provides human resource
products and services through its HRS division.

HRS markets Cafeteria Plan products approved under Section 125 of the
Internal Revenue Code.  The Premium Only Plan allows employees to pay for
certain fringe benefits with pre-tax dollars, with a resultant reduction
of payroll taxes to employers and employees.  The Flexible Spending
Account Plan allows client employees to pay for health and dependent care
expenses with pre-tax dollars.  All administration, compliance, coverage and
discrimination tests are provided with these services.

The HRS Division's employee management services and products include
customized employee handbooks, management manuals, job descriptions and
personnel forms.   These have been designed to simplify clients' office
processes and enhance their employee benefits programs.  Also available are
group insurance products offered in selected geographical areas.

During 1995, the HRS Division introduced a 401(K) Recordkeeping Service to
selected markets.  This service provides plan design and implementation,
ongoing compliance with government regulations, employee and employer
reporting and other administrative services.

Products and services of the HRS Division are sold through a separate
sales organization located in most branch offices.  Some of the products
and services are available on a nationwide basis through an inside sales
group.

Software Maintenance and Product Development.
- ---------------------------------------------

The ever-changing mandates of Federal, State and local taxing authorities
compel the Company to continuously update its proprietary software. The
Company is also engaged in developing ongoing enhancements to its software
to meet the changing requirements of its clients and the marketplace.
However, the Company is not engaged, to any significant extent, in basic
software research and development.

Competition.
- ------------
The payroll accounting services industry is characterized by intense
competition.  The principal competitive factors are price and service.
Paychex believes it has one major competitor that provides computerized
payroll accounting services nationwide.  Although this competitor has
historically concentrated on larger employers, it has for several years
marketed directly to the small and medium sized businesses which
constitute the Paychex market.  In addition, the Company competes with
other providers of computerized payroll services, including banks and
smaller independent firms.

The Company's principal competition, used by a majority of the businesses
in its market, is manual payroll systems sold by numerous vendors.  Some
companies have in-house computer capability to generate their own payroll
documents and reports.

Executive Officers.
- -------------------
The information required is set forth in the Company's Proxy Statement and
is incorporated herein by reference.

Employees.
- ----------
Paychex currently employs approximately 3,950 persons, of which 3,760 are
full time and 190 are part time.

Trademarks.
- -----------
The Company has a number of trademarks registered in the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office including the names PAYCHEX, TAXPAY and PAYLINK.  The
Company believes these trademarks are of material importance to its
business.

Seasonality.
- ------------
There is no significant seasonality to the Company's business, except that
over  30% of new clients added in each of the last two fiscal years have
been added during the third fiscal quarter.  Consequently, greater sales
commissions are paid in that quarter, resulting in higher selling expenses
for the third quarter.

Item 2.  Properties.
         -----------
The corporate headquarters, owned by the Company, occupy a 139,000 square foot
office complex in a suburb of Rochester, New York.  The Company owns and
occupies a 62,000 square foot office and distribution facility located within
10 miles of corporate headquarters.  The Company also owns a 20,000 square
foot office facility in Syracuse, New York. Approximately one-half of this
building is occupied by the Syracuse branch office and the remaining space is
leased.  In June, 1995, the Company acquired a 38,000 square foot building (on
leased land) as part of the Company's acquisition of Pay-Fone Systems, Inc., a
payroll company located in Van Nuys, California.  Paychex occupies
approximately one half of the building and the remaining space is leased.

The Company leases office space for its branches and sales offices at
various locations throughout the country.  On average, branch offices
contain approximately 10,000 square feet and sales offices approximately
850 square feet.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.
         ------------------

There are no material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
         ----------------------------------------------------

No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year ended May 31, 1996.
