PART I

“SAFE
    HARBOR” STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION
    REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain written and oral statements made by management of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“we,”
    “our,” “us,” “Paychex,” or the
    “Company”) may constitute “forward-looking
    statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995 (the “Reform Act”). Forward-looking
    statements are identified by such words and phrases as “we
    expect,” “expected to,” “estimates,”
    “estimated,” “current outlook,” “we
    look forward to,” “would equate to,”
    “projects,” “projections,” “projected
    to be,” “anticipates,” “anticipated,”
    “we believe,” “could be,” and other similar
    phrases. All statements addressing operating performance,
    events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur
    in the future, including statements relating to revenue growth,
    earnings,

earnings-per-share

growth, or similar projections, are forward-looking statements
    within the meaning of the Reform Act. Because they are
    forward-looking, they should be evaluated in light of important
    risk factors. These risk factors include, but are not limited
    to, the following risks as well as those described in “Risk
    Factors” under Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

(“Form 10-K”):

•

general market and economic conditions including, among others,
    changes in United States (“U.S.”) employment and wage
    levels, changes in new hiring trends, legislative changes to
    stimulate the economy, changes in short- and long-term interest
    rates, changes in the fair value and the credit rating of
    securities held by us, and accessibility of financing;

•

changes in demand for our services and products, ability to
    develop and market new services and products effectively,
    pricing changes and the impact of competition, and the
    availability of skilled workers;

•

changes in the laws regulating collection and payment of payroll
    taxes, professional employer organizations, and employee
    benefits, including retirement plans, workers’
    compensation, health insurance, state unemployment, and
    section 125 plans;

•

changes in workers’ compensation rates and underlying
    claims trends;

•

the possibility of failure to keep pace with technological
    changes and provide timely enhancements to services and products;

•

the possibility of failure of our operating facilities, computer
    systems, and communication systems during a catastrophic event;

•

the possibility of third-party service providers failing to
    perform their functions;

•

the possible failure of internal controls or our inability to
    implement business processing improvements; and

•

potentially unfavorable outcomes related to pending legal
    matters.

Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ
    materially from our anticipated results. The information
    provided in this

Form 10-K

is based upon the facts and circumstances known at this time. We
    undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking
    statements after the date of filing of this

Form 10-K

with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
    “Commission”) to reflect events or circumstances after
    such date, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Item 1.

Business

We are a leading provider of payroll, human resource, and
    benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized
    businesses. As of May 31, 2011, we serviced approximately
    564,000 clients and had approximately 12,400 employees. We
    maintain our corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and
    have more than 100 offices nationwide.

As of May 31, 2011, we serviced approximately 1,900 clients
    in Germany through four offices.

Our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in 1979. We
    report our results of operations and financial condition as one
    business segment. Our fiscal year ends May 31.



Company
    Strategy

We are focused on achieving strong, long-term financial
    performance by:

•

providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable
    comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource services;

•

delivering these services utilizing a well-trained and
    responsive work force through a network of local and corporate
    offices servicing more than 100 of the largest markets in the
    U.S.;

•

growing our client base, primarily through the efforts of our
    direct sales force;

•

continually improving client service to maximize client
    retention;

•

capitalizing on the growth opportunities within our existing
    client base and from new clients by increasing utilization of
    our payroll and human resource ancillary services and products;

•

capitalizing on and leveraging our highly developed technology
    and operating infrastructure;

•

investing in our business through expansion of our service and
    product offerings to continually add value for our
    clients; and

•

supplementing our growth through strategic acquisitions when
    appropriate opportunities arise.

Services
    and Products

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services and products that
    allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human
    resource needs. These include:

•

payroll processing;

•

payroll tax administration services;

•

employee payment services;

•

regulatory compliance services (new-hire reporting and
    garnishment processing);

•

Paychex HR Solutions;

•

retirement services administration;

•

insurance services;

•

eServices; and

•

other human resource services and products.

By offering ancillary services that leverage the information
    gathered in the base payroll processing service, we are able to
    provide comprehensive outsourcing services that allow employers
    to expand their employee benefits offerings at an affordable
    cost. We mainly earn our revenue through recurring fees for
    services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the
    number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay
    period, and utilization of ancillary services.

Payroll

Payroll processing is the foundation of our service portfolio.
    Our payroll service includes the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; preparation of
    federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
    and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations. Our payroll
    services are provided through either our core payroll or Major
    Market Services (“MMS”) and are made available to
    clients via traditional or Internet-based methods.

Paychex Online is our secure Internet site, which offers core
    payroll clients a suite of self-service, interactive services
    and products twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. These
    include Paychex Online
    Payroll

®

,

    Internet Time Sheet, Paychex Online Reports, and General Ledger
    Reporting Service. Using these services, clients can



communicate payroll information, access current and historical
    payroll information, and transfer payroll information calculated
    by us to their general ledger accounting software, eliminating
    manual entries and improving the accuracy of bookkeeping. More
    than one-half of our clients are currently utilizing some form
    of Paychex Online payroll service.

During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2011 (“fiscal
    2011”), we acquired SurePayroll, Inc.
    (“SurePayroll”), a provider of software-as-a-service
    payroll processing for small businesses. This acquisition
    expands our product offering for small business clients to
    self-service and mobile applications.

Major Market Services:

MMS primarily
    targets companies that have more sophisticated payroll and
    benefits needs. We currently offer this service in all of our
    significant markets. Our proprietary MMS software,
    Preview

®

,

    provides a powerful payroll solution and allows smooth
    integration with other Paychex service offerings. Preview can be
    used as an

on-site,

PC-based system or via a secure web-hosted environment.

We offer a software-as-a-service solution to meet the payroll
    and human resource administrative needs of our MMS clients. This
    allows Preview to be integrated with various Internet-based
    services offered to assist clients with their administrative
    human resource and payroll needs through every step of the
    employee life cycle. Ancillary services particularly beneficial
    to our MMS clients include the following:

•

Paychex HR Online, our Internet-based human resource management
    system, offers powerful tools for managing employee benefits,
    personnel information, and critical human resource compliance
    and reporting needs. In addition, its self-service features
    allow for better communication between management and employees.

•

BeneTrac, our employee benefits management and administration
    system, provides our MMS clients a simple, accurate, and
    cost-effective solution for streamlined benefits management.

•

Paychex Time and Labor Online makes the time and attendance
    process more efficient. This solution can reduce time spent on
    preparing timesheets, minimize redundant data entry, increase
    awareness of critical labor information, and aid in compliance
    with federal time recording requirements.

•

Paychex Expense Manager is an integrated payroll and expense
    management solution that allows clients to control discretionary
    spending while giving employees an easy-to-use, secure tool to
    prepare and submit expense reports online.

•

Applicant tracking, offered through our partnership with Taleo
    Corporation, provides our MMS clients with a tool to manage
    their recruiting process in order to better hire and retain
    talented employees.

MMS clients can select Paychex One-Source Solutions, which
    seamlessly integrates Preview, Paychex Time and Labor Online,
    and Paychex HR Online applications through a single, web-based
    client portal. MMS clients also have the option to select from a
    number of á la carte payroll and human resource ancillary
    services or opt for our comprehensive human resource and payroll
    outsourcing solution, Paychex HR Solutions. This flexibility
    allows our clients to define the solution that best meets their
    particular needs.

Payroll tax administration services:

As
    of May 31, 2011, 95% of our clients utilized our payroll
    tax administration services (including
    Taxpay

®

),

    which provide accurate preparation and timely filing of
    quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic
    transfer of funds to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies
    (federal, state, and local). In connection with these services,
    we electronically collect payroll taxes from clients’ bank
    accounts, typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable
    tax returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically
    paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections
    from clients, with some items extending to 90 days. We
    handle regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and
    interest disputes, and we are subject to cash penalties imposed
    by tax or regulatory agencies for late filings and late or under
    payment of taxes.

Employee payment services:

As of
    May 31, 2011, 79% of our clients utilized our employee
    payment services, which provide the employer the option of
    paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a
    check drawn on a Paychex account
    (Readychex

®

),

    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by us. For the first three methods, we
    electronically collect net payroll from the clients’ bank
    accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provide
    payment to the employees on payday. Our flexible payment



options provide a cost-effective solution that offers the
    benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation
    for employers.

Regulatory compliance services:

We
    offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to
    comply with federal and state requirements to report information
    on newly hired employees. This information aids the government
    in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent
    unemployment and workers’ compensation insurance claims.
    Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from
    employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies,
    including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the
    obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to
    comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties.

Human
    Resource Services

Paychex HR Solutions:

We offer
    comprehensive human resource outsourcing solutions that provide
    businesses a full-service approach to the outsourcing of
    employer and employee administrative needs. Our Paychex HR
    Solutions offering is available as an administrative services
    organization (“ASO”), previously known as Paychex
    Premier

®

Human Resources, and a professional employer organization
    (“PEO”). Both options offer businesses a combined
    package of services that includes payroll, employer compliance,
    human resource and employee benefits administration, risk
    management outsourcing, and the

on-site

availability of a professionally trained human resource
    representative. These comprehensive bundles of services are
    designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
    payroll and related benefit costs while providing a benefits
    package equal to that of larger companies. Our PEO differs from
    the ASO in that we serve as a co-employer of the clients’
    employees, assume the risks and rewards of workers’
    compensation insurance, and provide health care coverage to PEO
    client employees. PEO services continue to be sold through our
    registered and licensed subsidiary, Paychex Business Solutions,
    Inc. The integration of the sales and service models of the ASO
    and PEO under Paychex HR Solutions has reduced redundancies and
    created more flexible options for business owners to find the
    solution that best meets their needs. In fiscal 2011, we
    introduced Paychex HR Essentials, which is an ASO product that
    provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help
    manage employee-related topics. As of May 31, 2011, Paychex
    HR Solutions were utilized by 21,000 clients with approximately
    567,000 client employees.

Retirement services administration:

Our
    retirement services product line offers a variety of options to
    clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE, SIMPLE IRA,
    401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, profit sharing, and
    money purchase plans. These services provide plan
    implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations,
    employee and employer reporting, participant and employer online
    access, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative
    services. Auto enrollment is an optional plan feature allowing
    employers to automatically enroll employees in their
    company’s 401(k) plan and increase overall plan
    participation. Clients have the ability to choose from a group
    of pre-defined fund selections or to customize their investment
    options within their plan. Selling efforts for these services
    are focused primarily on our existing payroll client base, as
    the processed payroll information allows for data integration
    necessary to provide these services efficiently. We are one of
    the largest 401(k) recordkeepers for small businesses in the
    U.S. We earn an average fee of slightly less than
    twenty-five basis points from the external fund managers based
    on the total asset value of client employee 401(k) funds. In May
    2011, we acquired ePlan Services, Inc., a provider of
    recordkeeping and administrative solutions to the defined
    contribution marketplace. This acquisition allows us to expand
    our retirement services to financial advisers. As of
    May 31, 2011, retirement services were utilized by
    approximately 57,000 clients and the asset value of client
    employee 401(k) funds externally managed totaled approximately
    $15.3 billion.

Insurance services:

Our licensed
    insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. (“Paychex
    Insurance Agency”), provides insurance through a variety of
    carriers. Insurance offerings include property and casualty
    coverage such as workers’ compensation; business-owner
    policies; commercial auto; and health and benefits coverage
    including health, dental, vision, and life. Our insurance
    services simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find
    plans with the features and affordability to meet the
    client’s needs. With access to numerous top national and
    regional carriers, our professional insurance agents enjoy a
    wide selection of plans from which to best match the insurance
    needs of small business. Clients also have the option to
    integrate with Paychex payroll processing for easy, accurate
    plan administration. Paychex Insurance Agency has a website,

www.paychexinsurance.com

, with information and
    interactive tools to help educate visitors on insurance and aid
    in making business insurance decisions. As of May 31, 2011,
    approximately 100,000 clients have appointed Paychex Insurance
    Agency as their agent for servicing their business insurance
    needs.



eServices:

We offer online human
    resource administration software products for employee benefits
    management and administration and time and attendance solutions.
    Paychex HR Online offers powerful tools for managing employee
    benefits, personnel information, and human resource compliance
    and reporting. Time and Labor Online helps minimize the time
    spent compiling time sheet information. It allows the employer
    to handle multiple payroll scenarios and results in improved
    productivity, accuracy, and reliability in the payroll process.

Other human resource services and
    products:

We offer the outsourcing of plan
    administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for
    certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care
    expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation,
    administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement,
    and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer
    state unemployment insurance services, which provide clients
    with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations,
    change statements, and requests for separation documents. Other
    Human Resource Services products include employee handbooks,
    management manuals, and personnel and required regulatory forms.
    These products are designed to simplify clients’ office
    processes and enhance their employee benefits programs.

Sales and
    Marketing

We market our services primarily through our direct sales force
    based in the metropolitan markets we serve, with sales
    representatives specializing within our portfolio of services.
    For the year ending May 31, 2012 (“fiscal 2012”),
    our sales force is expected to total approximately 2,400
    representatives. Our sales representatives are also supported by
    marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and
    telemarketing programs. We have grown and expect to continue to
    grow our direct sales force. In recent years, we have increased
    our emphasis on the selling of ancillary services and products
    to both new clients and our existing client base.

In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we
    utilize relationships with existing clients, certified public
    accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client
    referrals. More than 60% of our new core payroll clients
    (excluding acquisitions) come from these referral sources. To
    further enhance our strong relationship with CPAs, we have
    partnered with the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll
    provider for its AICPA Business Solutions Partner Program since
    2003. This long-standing strategic alliance has been extended to
    September 2016.

Our website at

www.paychex.com

, which includes online
    payroll sales presentations and service and product information,
    is a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of leads and
    new sales while complementing the efforts of our direct sales
    force. This online tool allows us to market to clients in more
    geographically remote areas. In addition, our insurance services
    website at

www.paychexinsurance.com

provides information
    to help small businesses navigate the insurance industry, and
    generates leads by allowing interested parties to get in contact
    with one of our professional insurance agents.

In addition, Advantage Payroll Services Inc.
    (“Advantage”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex,
    Inc., has license agreements with independently owned associate
    offices (“Associates”), which are responsible for
    selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing
    certain operational functions, while Paychex and Advantage
    provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and
    payroll tax administration services. The marketing and selling
    by the Associates is conducted under their own logos.

Markets
    and Competition

Industry data indicates there are approximately ten million
    employers in the geographic markets that we currently serve
    within the U.S. Of those employers, approximately 99% have
    fewer than 100 employees and are our primary customers and
    target market. We remain focused on servicing small- to
    medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we
    believe exists in this market segment.

We serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients
    operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the
    U.S. As of May 31, 2011, we serviced approximately
    564,000 clients. We utilize service agreements and arrangements
    with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any
    time or upon relatively short notice. For fiscal 2011, client
    retention was approximately 79% of our beginning client base, up
    two percentage points from the fiscal year ended May 31,
    2010 (“fiscal 2010”). Clients lost in fiscal 2011
    decreased 9% compared to fiscal



2010, largely due to fewer clients going out of business or
    having no employees. No single client has a material impact on
    total service revenue or results of operations.

The composition of the U.S. market and the client base we
    serve by number of employees is as follows:

Based on currently available market data from Dun &

The market for payroll processing and human resource services is
    highly competitive and fragmented. Our primary national
    competitor,
    ADP

®

(“Automatic Data Processing, Inc.”), is the largest
    U.S. third-party provider of payroll processing and human
    resource services in terms of revenue. We compete with other
    national, regional, local, and online service providers, all of
    which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us.

In addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource
    service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and human
    resource systems and departments. Payroll and human resource
    systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our Human
    Resource Services also compete with a variety of providers of
    human resource services, such as retirement services companies,
    insurance companies, and human resources and benefits consulting
    firms.

Competition in the payroll processing and human resource
    services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness,
    product quality and reputation, breadth of service and product
    offering, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of
    these areas.

Software
    Maintenance and Development

The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and
    regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the
    proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human
    resource services to our clients. We are continually engaged in
    developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various
    software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our
    clients and the marketplace.

In fiscal 2010, we completed implementation of an enhanced
    platform for our core processing capability, which allows us to
    leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide
    excellent customer service. Over the next few years, we will
    expand this platform to additional service offerings.

Employees

As of May 31, 2011, we employed approximately
    12,400 people. None of our employees were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements.

Intellectual
    Property

We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names,
    copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and
    software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a
    whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the
    conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be
    appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual
    property rights, including, but not limited to,
    confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with
    employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with
    licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and
    registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the
    “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material
    importance to us.



Seasonality

There is no significant seasonality to our business. However,
    during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the
    number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients,
    and new Paychex HR Solutions worksite employees tends to be
    higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily
    because a majority of new clients begin using our services in
    the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end
    transaction processing and client funds activity are
    traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to
    clients paying year-end bonuses and requesting additional
    year-end services. Historically, as a result of these factors,
    our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal
    quarter, with greater sales commission expenses also reported in
    this quarter.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our future results of operations are subject to a number of
    risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could
    cause actual results to differ materially from historical and
    current results and from our projections. Important factors
    known to us that could cause such differences include, but are
    not limited to, those discussed below and those contained in the
    “Safe Harbor” statement at the beginning of
    Part I of this

Form 10-K.

Our services may be adversely impacted by changes in
    government regulations and policies:

Many of
    our services, particularly payroll tax administration services
    and employee benefit plan administration services, are designed
    according to government regulations that continually change.
    Changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of
    benefits employers are required, or may choose, to provide
    employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and
    employees are required to pay. Such changes could reduce or
    eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially
    decrease our revenue. Added requirements could also increase our
    cost of doing business. Failure to educate and assist our
    clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them
    could have an adverse impact on our reputation. Failure by us to
    modify our services in a timely fashion in response to
    regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our
    business and results of operations.

Our interest earned on funds held for clients may be
    impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the
    amount of tax withheld or timing of
    remittance:

We receive interest income from
    investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. A
    change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to
    be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable
    tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest
    income.

We may not be able to keep pace with changes in
    technology:

To maintain our growth strategy,
    we must adapt and respond to technological advances and
    technological requirements of our clients. Our future success
    will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase
    the performance of our internal use systems, particularly our
    systems that meet our clients’ requirements. We continue to
    make significant investments related to the



development of new technology. If our systems become outdated,
    we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry.
    There can be no assurance that our efforts to update and
    integrate systems will be successful. If we do not integrate and
    update our systems in a timely manner, or if our investments in
    technology fail to provide the expected results, there could be
    a material adverse effect to our business and results of
    operations.

Our business and reputation may be affected by our ability
    to keep clients’ information
    confidential:

Our business involves the use
    of significant amounts of private and confidential client
    information including employees’ identification numbers,
    bank accounts, and retirement account information. This
    information is critical to the accurate and timely provision of
    services to our clients, and certain information may be
    transmitted via the Internet. There is no guarantee that our
    systems and processes are adequate to protect against all
    security breaches. If our systems are disrupted or fail for any
    reason, or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized
    persons, our clients could experience data loss, financial loss,
    harm to reputation, or significant business interruption. Such
    events may expose us to unexpected liability, litigation,
    regulation investigation and penalties, loss of clients’
    business, unfavorable impact to business reputation, and there
    could be a material adverse effect on our business and results
    of operations.

We may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party
    service providers to perform their
    functions:

As part of providing services to
    clients, we rely on a number of third-party service providers.
    These service providers include, but are not limited to,
    couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to
    electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees.
    Failure by these service providers, for any reason, to deliver
    their services in a timely manner could result in material
    interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and
    result in significant penalties or liabilities to us.

We may be exposed to additional risks related to our
    co-employment relationship within our PEO
    business:

Many federal and state laws that
    apply to the employer-employee relationship do not specifically
    address the obligations and responsibilities of the
    “co-employment” relationship. As a result, there is a
    possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations
    of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or
    omissions of client employees, who may be deemed to be our
    agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or
    violations. Although our agreements with the clients provide
    that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable
    to its own or its employees’ conduct, we may not be able to
    effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations. In
    addition, we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our
    employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the
    “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws.

We may be adversely impacted by volatility in the
    financial and economic environment:

During
    periods of weak economic conditions, employment levels tend to
    decrease and interest rates may become more volatile. These
    conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction
    volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of
    business. Current or potential clients may decide to reduce
    their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services. In
    addition, new business starts may be affected by an inability to
    obtain credit. The interest we earn on funds held for clients
    may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to
    invest and lower interest rates. In addition, during periods of
    volatility in the credit markets, certain types of investments
    may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to
    invest in, further reducing the interest we may earn on client
    funds. Constriction in the credit markets may impact the
    availability of financing, even to borrowers with the highest
    credit ratings. We historically have not borrowed against
    available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs. However,
    should we require additional short-term liquidity during days of
    large outflows of client funds, a credit constriction may limit
    our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain
    them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us. If all of
    these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in
    effect for an extended period of time, there could be a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

In the event of a catastrophe, our business continuity
    plan may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and
    adversely interrupt operations:

Our
    operations are dependent on our ability to protect our
    infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural
    disaster, severe weather including events resulting from climate
    change, unauthorized security breach, power loss,
    telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, or other events
    that could have a significant disruptive effect on our
    operations. We have a business continuity plan in place in the
    event of system failure due to any of these events. Our business
    continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of
    severe weather, including floods and snowstorms, and has been
    successful. However, these past successes are not



an indicator of success in the future. If the business
    continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario,
    we could potentially lose client data or experience material
    adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services
    to our clients.

We may have an adverse outcome of legal matters, which
    could harm our business:

We are subject to
    various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course
    of business. These include disputes or potential disputes
    related to breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty,
    employment-related claims, tax claims, and other matters. Refer
    to Item 3 of this

Form 10-K

for additional disclosure regarding legal proceedings. Legal
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists
    the possibility that their ultimate resolution could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position and results of
    operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

Our management currently believes that resolution of outstanding
    legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position or results of operations. However, legal
    matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists
    the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters
    could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
    financial position and the results of operations in the period
    in which any such effect is recorded.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations reviews the operating results of
    Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
    (“Paychex,” “we,” “our,” or
    “us”) for each of the three fiscal years ended
    May 31, 2011 (“fiscal 2011”), May 31, 2010
    (“fiscal 2010”), and May 31, 2009 (“fiscal
    2009”), and our financial condition as of May 31,
    2011. This review should be read in conjunction with the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related
    notes to consolidated financial statements contained in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(“Form 10-K”)

and the “Risk Factors” discussed in Item 1A of
    this

Form 10-K.

Forward-looking statements in this review are qualified by the
    cautionary statement under the heading “Safe Harbor
    Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
    1995” contained at the beginning of Part I of this

Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a leading provider of payroll, human resource, and
    benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized
    businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a
    portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to
    meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs. Our payroll
    services are the foundation of our service portfolio. They are
    provided through either our core payroll or Major Market
    Services (“MMS”), which is utilized by clients that
    have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs, and include:

•

payroll processing;

•

payroll tax administration services;

•

employee payment services; and

•

regulatory compliance services (new-hire reporting and
    garnishment processing).

In addition to the above, our software-as-a-service option
    through our MMS platform provides human resource management,
    employee benefits management, time and attendance systems,
    online expense reporting, and applicant tracking.



Our Human Resource Services primarily include:

•

Paychex HR Solutions, under which we offer our administrative
    services organization (“ASO”) and our professional
    employer organization (“PEO”). We also offer Paychex
    HR Essentials, our new ASO product that provides support to our
    clients over the phone or online to help manage employee-related
    topics;

•

retirement services administration;

•

insurance services;

•

eServices; and

•

other human resource services and products.

We earn revenue mainly through recurring fees for services
    performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of
    clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and
    utilization of ancillary services. We also earn interest on
    funds held for clients between the time of collection from our
    clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. Our business strategy is focused
    on achieving strong long-term financial performance by providing
    high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services; growing
    our client base; increasing utilization of our ancillary
    services; leveraging our technology and operating
    infrastructure; and expanding our service offerings.

Our financial results for fiscal 2011 reflected

year-over-year

growth. We continued to see improvement in many of our key
    business indicators, especially in checks per client. Checks per
    client increased 2.1% for fiscal 2011, compared to a decline of
    2.6% for fiscal 2010. Checks per client began to show

year-over-year

growth in the three months ending May 31, 2010 with 1.1%
    growth for that quarter and continued to improve throughout
    fiscal 2011, reflecting increases of 1.2%, 2.5%, 2.8%, and
    2.0% for each of the sequential quarters. Our revenue growth has
    been modest, as new sales units were relatively flat compared to
    the prior year, largely due to lack of growth in new business
    starts.

Our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the
    interest rate environment. The equity markets hit a low in March
    2009, with interest rates available on high quality financial
    instruments remaining low since that time. The Federal Funds
    rate has been at a range of zero to 0.25% since December 2008.
    Our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment
    portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for fiscal
    2011, compared to 1.5% for fiscal 2010 and 2.1% for fiscal 2009.

We continue to manage our headcount and expenses while investing
    in our business, particularly in areas related to selling and
    servicing our clients, product development, and the technology
    required to support these areas. We believe these investments
    are critical to our success. Looking to the future, we continue
    to focus on investing in our products, people, and service
    capabilities, positioning ourselves to capitalize on
    opportunities for long-term growth.

Highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2011 compared to
    fiscal 2010 are as follows:

•

Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $1.4 billion.

•

Human Resource Services revenue increased 10% to
    $597.4 million.

•

Interest on funds held for clients decreased 13% to
    $48.1 million.

•

Total revenue increased 4% to $2.1 billion.

•

Operating income increased 8% to $786.4 million, and
    operating income, net of certain items, increased 7% to
    $738.3 million. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial
    Measure” discussion on page 14 for further information
    on operating income, net of certain items.

•

Operating income for fiscal 2010 reflected an expense charge of
    $18.7 million to increase the litigation reserve related to
    the Rapid Payroll court decision, which reduced diluted earnings
    per share for fiscal 2010 by $0.03 per share.

•

Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 8% to
    $515.3 million and $1.42 per share, respectively.



•

Cash flow from operations increased 17% to $715.3 million,
    primarily related to the increase in net income and fluctuations
    in operating assets and liabilities.

•

Dividends of $448.8 million were paid to stockholders,
    representing 87% of net income.

During fiscal 2011, we completed the acquisition of two
    software-as-a-service companies, opening up additional areas of
    the markets we serve. SurePayroll, Inc.
    (“SurePayroll”), a provider of payroll processing for
    small businesses, was acquired on February 8, 2011 for
    $114.9 million, net of cash acquired. SurePayroll serves
    small businesses with its easy-to-use, online payroll product
    and mobile application. This acquisition allows us entry into a
    new area of the online payroll market, and provides our clients
    with a mobile self-service alternative. The acquisition of
    SurePayroll was dilutive to fiscal 2011 by less than $0.01 per
    share. ePlan Services, Inc. (“ePlan”), a provider of
    recordkeeping and administrative solutions to the defined
    contribution marketplace, was acquired on May 3, 2011 for
    $15.2 million, net of cash acquired. Both entities now
    operate as wholly owned subsidiaries of Paychex. Our financial
    results include the results of these entities from their
    respective dates of acquisition. Neither acquisition is
    significant to our consolidated financial statements.

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measure

In addition to reporting operating income, a United States
    (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principle
    (“GAAP”) measure, we present operating income, net of
    certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating
    income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional
    measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations
    performance period over period. It is also the basis of the
    measure used internally for establishing the following
    year’s targets and measuring management’s performance
    in connection with certain performance-based compensation
    payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items,
    excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense
    charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve.
    Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating
    income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not
    within the control of management. The expense charge to increase
    the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income
    due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the
    normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability
    of performance period over period. Operating income, net of
    certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP
    and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and
    Exchange Commission. As such, it should not be considered as a
    substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and,
    therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction
    with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may
    produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be
    comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other
    companies. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 7%
    to $738.3 million for fiscal 2011, compared to
    $688.5 million for fiscal 2010 and $729.7 million for
    fiscal 2009.

Business
    Outlook

Our client base was approximately 564,000 clients as of
    May 31, 2011, compared to approximately 536,000 clients as
    of May 31, 2010, and approximately 554,000 clients as of
    May 31, 2009. Our client base increased 5.2% for fiscal
    2011, compared to declines of 3.2% for fiscal 2010 and 3.1% for
    fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of 33,000 SurePayroll clients,
    our client base would have declined 0.9% for fiscal 2011. This
    reduction reflects the impact of lack of growth in new business
    starts on our client base, as our new sales units were
    relatively flat compared to fiscal 2010. On a positive note, our
    sales to clients who previously utilized the services of local
    and regional competitors improved for fiscal 2011.

For fiscal 2011, payroll services client retention was
    approximately 79% of our beginning client base, a two percentage
    point improvement over the prior year, as clients lost decreased
    9% for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease in
    client losses was largely attributable to fewer clients going
    out of business or having no employees for fiscal 2011 compared
    to fiscal 2010. In addition, we lost fewer clients to local and
    regional competitors for fiscal 2011. Through our focus on
    providing high-quality service to our customers to maximize
    client retention, we received the highest client satisfaction
    results in the past several years.



Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data

Continued investment in our business is critical to our success.
    In fiscal 2011, we made investments in our sales force and
    product development. Our sales force increased 2% to 2,380 sales
    representatives for fiscal 2011, and is expected to grow 1% to
    2,400 sales representatives for the fiscal year ending
    May 31, 2012 (“fiscal 2012”). This growth is
    driven primarily by increases in insurance services and other
    Human Resource Services offerings.

We have continued to expand our enhanced payroll processing
    platform to include additional service offerings. This new
    platform allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and
    continue to provide excellent customer service to our clients.
    Our enhanced platform has led to improved productivity within
    our operations, contributing to the increase in our operating
    income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue
    to 36.3% for fiscal 2011, compared to 35.4% for the prior year.

Over the next few years, we will continue to invest in our
    product development, as we believe it is critical to our
    success. We have introduced new product offerings to add value
    for our clients. In fiscal 2011, we introduced Paychex HR
    Essentials, an ASO offering that provides support to our clients
    over the phone or online to help manage employee-related topics.
    We also introduced Paychex
    SmartTime

tm

time clocks for small businesses. This self-contained system
    offers small businesses an economical, easy-to-use time and
    attendance solution that automatically collects and calculates
    employee hours, and integrates with Paychex payroll.

We continued the expansion of our insurance services nationwide,
    simplifying the process required to obtain coverage through our
    network of national and regional insurers. We now service over
    100,000 clients through our subsidiary, Paychex Insurance
    Agency, Inc. We believe insurance services is an area that
    continues to offer significant opportunities for future growth.

We strengthened our position as an expert in our industry by
    serving as a source of education and information to clients and
    other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white
    papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and
    prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes. In
    addition, the Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. website,

www.paychexinsurance.com

, helps small business owners
    navigate the area of insurance coverage.

Financial
    position and liquidity

The volatility in the global financial markets that began in
    September 2008 continues to curtail available liquidity and
    limit investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic
    environment, as of May 31, 2011, our financial position
    remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of
    $671.3 million and no debt.

Our investment strategy focuses on optimizing liquidity and
    protecting principal. Yields on high quality financial
    instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned
    on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest
    predominately in municipal bonds — general obligation
    bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a
    U.S. government escrow; and essential services revenue
    bonds. Our primary short-term investment vehicle has been
    U.S. agency discount notes. Starting in November 2009, we
    began to invest in select

A-1/P-1-rated

variable rate demand notes (“VRDNs”) and have
    gradually increased our investment in VRDNs to
    $828.3 million as of May 31, 2011. During fiscal 2011,
    we earned an after-tax rate of approximately 0.23% for VRDNs
    compared to approximately 0.06% for U.S. agency discount
    notes.



We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA
    and AA ratings and short-term securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single
    issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments
    whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We
    believe that our investments as of May 31, 2011 were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date
    that would indicate any

other-than-temporary

impairment. All investments held as of May 31, 2011 were
    traded in active markets.

Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow
    from operations was $715.3 million for fiscal 2011.
    Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases,
    business acquisitions, and dividend payments from our operating
    activities. Our positive cash flows in fiscal 2011 allowed us to
    support our business growth and to pay substantial dividends to
    our stockholders. During fiscal 2011, dividends paid to
    stockholders were 87% of net income. It is anticipated that cash
    and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2011, along
    with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal
    business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments
    for the foreseeable future.

For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal
    years 2011, 2010, and 2009, and our financial position as of
    May 31, 2011, refer to the tables and analysis in the
    “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and
    Capital Resources” sections of this Item 7 and the
    discussion in the “Critical Accounting Policies”
    section of this Item 7.

Outlook

Our outlook for fiscal 2012 is based upon current economic and
    interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes.
    Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections
    do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest
    rates. Our fiscal 2012 guidance reflects anticipated results for
    SurePayroll and ePlan. The anticipated service revenue impact is
    approximately 2% and the earnings dilution is expected to be
    approximately $0.01 per share, mainly due to amortization of
    acquired intangible assets. Our fiscal 2012 guidance is as
    follows:

Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of
    service revenue is expected to range from 35% to 36% for fiscal
    2012. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate
    35% for fiscal 2012.

Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for
    fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the continuing
    low-interest-rate environment. The average rate of return on our
    combined funds held for clients and corporate investment
    portfolios is expected to be 1.2% for fiscal 2012. As of
    May 31, 2011, the long-term investment portfolio had an
    average

yield-to-maturity

of 2.6% and an average duration of 2.4 years. In the next
    twelve months, slightly more than 20% of this portfolio will
    mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will
    be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately
    1.0%. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing
    investment of cash generated from operations, though at a lower
    growth rate as a result of cash outlays in fiscal 2011 for
    business acquisitions.

Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to our
    earnings from a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in
    short-term interest rates would be in the range of
    $3.5 million to $4.0 million, after taxes, for a
    twelve-month period. Such a basis point change may or may not be
    tied to changes in the Federal Funds rate.

Purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2012 are expected
    to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million. This
    includes costs for internally developed software as we continue
    to invest in our product development. Fiscal 2012 depreciation
    expense is projected to be in the range of $75 million to
    $80 million, and we project amortization of intangible
    assets for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $20 million to
    $25 million. Intangible assets acquired from SurePayroll
    and ePlan are expected to increase amortization expense for
    fiscal 2012, partially offset by the impact of fully amortized
    intangibles.

Payroll service revenue:

Payroll
    service revenue increased 2% to $1.4 billion for fiscal
    2011, compared to a 5% decline for fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011
    revenue benefited from an increase in checks per client and
    revenue per check. Checks per client increased 2.1% for fiscal
    2011 compared to fiscal 2010. Revenue per check was positively
    impacted by lower discounting within our overall client base and
    price increases. Our client base, excluding the impact of
    SurePayroll, declined 0.9% during fiscal 2011. This was largely
    attributable to the adverse impact on the sales of new units
    from lack of growth in new business starts. Client retention
    improved for fiscal 2011, with client losses that were 9% lower
    than for fiscal 2010, largely a result of fewer clients going
    out of business or having no employees. In addition, fiscal 2011
    new sales units and client losses related to local and regional
    competitors improved compared to the prior year.

The decrease in payroll service revenue for fiscal 2010 was as a
    result of the cumulative adverse effects of weak economic
    conditions on our client base and check volume. Our client base
    decreased 3.2% during fiscal 2010 and checks per client
    decreased 2.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.

Human Resource Services revenue:

Human
    Resource Services revenue increased 10% for fiscal 2011 and 3%
    for fiscal 2010 to $597.4 million and $540.9 million,
    respectively. Human Resource Services revenue growth for both
    fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was impacted by the revenue earned
    from Stromberg time and attendance operations
    (“Stromberg”), an immaterial component of Paychex,
    prior to its sale in October 2009. In addition, retirement
    services revenue growth for fiscal 2010 was impacted by billings
    in fiscal 2009 related to restatements of clients’
    retirement plans required by statute, which are not expected to
    recur for approximately six years. This favorably impacted
    retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2009 by
    $12.4 million and did not recur in fiscal 2010. Excluding
    the impact of Stromberg in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, and
    the impact of retirement plan restatement billings for fiscal
    2010, Human Resource Services revenue growth would have been as
    follows:

Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2011 reflects
    modest improvements in economic conditions, the client growth
    noted above, and price increases. Paychex HR Solutions revenue
    for fiscal 2011 was positively impacted by increases in both
    clients and client employees. Contributing to this growth in
    clients and client employees is our new product offering,
    Paychex HR Essentials. Growth in certain products that are
    primarily beneficial to our MMS clients contributed positively
    to Human Resource Services revenue growth for both fiscal 2011
    and fiscal 2010. Also, insurance services revenue continued to
    grow as a result of increases in both health and benefits
    services and workers’ compensation insurance services
    revenue. Health and benefits services revenue continued its
    accelerated growth since inception, increasing 29% for fiscal
    2011 and 49% for fiscal 2010, driven primarily by the number of
    applicants.

Somewhat offsetting these positive factors, fluctuations in our
    PEO revenue had an adverse impact on Human Resource Services
    revenue growth for fiscal 2011. PEO net service revenue is more
    variable quarter to quarter than our other revenue streams due
    to fluctuations in adding and retaining client employees as
    healthcare rates change.

For fiscal 2010, client growth as noted above positively
    impacted Human Resource Services Revenue; however, the rates of
    growth were adversely affected by the cumulative impact of weak
    economic conditions on our client base. This particularly
    affected retirement services, although client growth for
    retirement services rebounded somewhat late in fiscal 2010 as
    client losses improved compared to the prior year.

In fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, the 35% and 33% increases in the
    asset value of retirement services client employees’ funds
    were driven by recovery in the financial markets and increased
    levels of larger plans converting to Paychex. For both fiscal
    2011 and fiscal 2010, retirement services revenue growth was
    adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of assets in the
    retirement services client employees’ funds to investments
    earning lower fees from external fund managers.

Total service revenue:

Total service
    revenue increased 5% for fiscal 2011 and declined 3% for fiscal
    2010, attributable to the factors previously discussed.

Interest on funds held for clients:

The
    decrease of 13% in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal
    2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of lower average
    interest rates earned, offset somewhat by an increase in average
    investment balances. The decrease of 27% in interest on funds
    held for clients for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the
    result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average
    investment balances, offset somewhat by higher net realized
    gains on sales of

available-for-sale

securities.

Average investment balances for funds held for clients increased
    6% for fiscal 2011 and decreased 5% for fiscal 2010. The
    increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2011 was the
    result of increases in state unemployment insurance rates for
    the 2011 calendar year and the increase in checks per client,
    offset somewhat by the lingering effects of the difficult
    economic conditions on our client base. The decline in average
    investment balances for fiscal 2010 was the result of the
    cumulative adverse effect of weak economic conditions on our
    client



base and lower tax withholdings for client employees resulting
    from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the
    “economic stimulus package”). In the second half of
    fiscal 2010, the impact of these factors was partially offset by
    increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010
    calendar year. The economic stimulus package went into effect in
    April 2009, and its impact on

year-over-year

comparisons of average investment balances had abated in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. This factor, along with the
    increases in state unemployment insurance rates, resulted in
    average investment balances for funds held for clients growing
    3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the same
    period in fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2010, we recorded an expense charge of
    $18.7 million to increase our litigation reserve. Refer to
    Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    contained in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for additional information on legal matters.

Excluding the aforementioned $18.7 million expense charge,
    combined operating and SG&A expenses increased 3% for
    fiscal 2011 and decreased 2% for fiscal 2010. The increase for
    fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by personnel-related costs, in
    part due to reinstatement of salary increases and 401(k) match
    as indicated below. In addition, we continued to invest in our
    product development and supporting technology. Improvements in
    productivity with related lower headcount in operations have
    moderated this increase. Fiscal 2011 compensation-related
    expenses include one-time costs related to the separation
    agreement entered into during the three months ended
    August 31, 2010 with Jonathan J. Judge, our former
    President and Chief Executive Officer. Expenses of SurePayroll
    and ePlan, which are included in our results since their
    respective acquisition dates, further impacted the growth in
    operating and SG&A expenses.

The decline in combined operating and SG&A expenses for
    fiscal 2010 was generated from cost control measures and lower
    headcount, offset slightly by costs related to continued
    investment in our sales force, customer service, and product
    development and supporting technology. In fiscal 2010, we saved
    approximately $30.0 million from a freeze on salary
    increases and providing no matching contributions to our 401(k)
    plan. We reinstituted salary increases beginning March 1,
    2010 and reinstated a 401(k) match effective January 1,
    2011.

As of May 31, 2011, we had approximately
    12,400 employees compared with approximately
    12,200 employees as of May 31, 2010 and
    12,500 employees as of May 31, 2009.

Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings,
    furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software.
    Increases in depreciation expense were due to capital
    expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow
    our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily
    related to client list acquisitions, which are amortized using
    either straight-line or accelerated methods. Depreciation and
    amortization increased in fiscal 2011 due to the acquisitions of
    SurePayroll and ePlan. Other expenses include items such as
    delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and
    entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred
    to support our business. The increase in other expenses for
    fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the largely fourth
    quarter impact from our two acquisitions.



Operating income:

Operating income
    increased 8% for fiscal 2011 and declined 10% for fiscal 2010.
    The fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the
    factors previously discussed.

Refer to the previous discussion of operating income, net of

Investment income, net:

Investment
    income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and
    cash equivalents and investments in

available-for-sale

securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds
    held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The
    increase of 29% in investment income for fiscal 2011 compared to
    fiscal 2010 was the result of higher average invested balances
    and a slight increase in average interest rates earned. The 1%
    increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2011 was the
    result of investment of cash generated from operations,
    partially offset by cash utilized to fund the acquisitions of
    SurePayroll and ePlan during the second half of fiscal 2011. The
    increase in average interest rates earned on corporate
    investments was primarily driven by higher yields on funds
    invested into our longer-term investment portfolio compared to
    the prior year. The decrease of 34% in investment income for
    fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower
    average interest rates earned offset somewhat by higher average
    investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated
    from operations.

Income taxes:

Our effective income tax
    rate was 35.0% for fiscal 2011, compared to 34.6% for fiscal
    2010, and 34.3% for fiscal 2009. The increase in our effective
    tax rate for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to lower
    tax-exempt income on

available-for-sale

securities during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The
    increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 was
    primarily the result of higher state income tax rates from state
    legislative changes. Refer to Note I of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K,

for additional disclosures on income taxes.

Net income and earnings per share:

Net
    income increased 8% to $515.3 million for fiscal 2011 and
    decreased 11% to $477.0 million for fiscal 2010. Diluted
    earnings per share increased 8% to 1.42 per share for fiscal
    2011 and decreased 11% to $1.32 per share for fiscal 2010. These
    fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously
    discussed. In particular, the $18.7 million expense charge
    to increase the litigation reserve reduced diluted earnings per
    share by $0.03 per share for fiscal 2010. Combined interest on
    funds held for clients and corporate investment income for
    fiscal 2010 decreased 28% or $22.8 million, reducing
    diluted earnings per share by $0.04 per share.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The volatility in the global financial markets that began in
    September 2008 continues to curtail available liquidity and
    limit investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic
    environment, our financial position as of May 31, 2011
    remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of
    $671.3 million and no debt. We also believe that our
    investments as of May 31, 2011 were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date
    that would indicate any

other-than-temporary

impairment. We anticipate that cash and total corporate
    investments as of May 31, 2011, along with projected
    operating cash flows will support our normal business
    operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the
    foreseeable future.



Commitments
    and Contractual Obligations

Lines of credit:

As of May 31,
    2011, we had unused borrowing capacity available under four
    uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market rates
    of interest with financial institutions as follows:

Financial institution

February 2012

Our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are
    secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between
    Paychex and each of the financial institutions (the
    “Lenders”), pursuant to which we have granted each of
    the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment
    securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
    custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and
    is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the
    Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may
    require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account
    into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual
    Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
    short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
    overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic
    payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary
    course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding
    against these lines of credit during fiscal 2011 or as of
    May 31, 2011.

JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. are also
    parties to our irrevocable standby letters of credit, which are
    discussed below.

Letters of credit:

As of May 31,
    2011, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding
    totaling $47.4 million, required to secure commitments for
    certain of our insurance policies. The letters of credit expire
    at various dates between July 2011 and December 2011, and are
    collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios.
    No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during
    fiscal 2011 or as of May 31, 2011. Subsequent to
    May 31, 2011, the letter of credit expiring in July 2011
    was renewed and will expire in July 2012.

Other commitments:

We have entered into
    various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under
    GAAP, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    May 31, 2011. The table below summarizes our estimated
    annual payment obligations under these commitments as of
    May 31, 2011:

(2)

Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum
    outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and
    services and legally binding contractual arrangements with
    future payment obligations. Included in the total purchase
    obligations is $6.0 million of commitments to purchase
    capital assets. Amounts actually paid under certain of these
    arrangements may be higher due to variable components of these
    agreements.

The liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately
    $34.4 million as of May 31, 2011. Refer to Note I
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

for more information on income taxes. We are not able to
    reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to
    this liability and have excluded it from the table above. We are
    currently under a state income tax audit for the fiscal years
    ended May 31, 2004 through 2009. On July 14, 2010, we
    received a summary of proposed tax adjustments from the New York
    State Department of Taxation and Finance, which was in excess of
    the reserve recorded as of May 31, 2011. The outcome



of the audit and the timing of settlement, if any, are subject
    to significant uncertainty. It is not possible to reasonably
    estimate the impact, if any, if resolution is ultimately
    unfavorable to us.

Certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other
    long-term liabilities amounting to $52.1 million are
    excluded from the table above because the timing of actual
    payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to
    the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of
    future payments.

Advantage Payroll Services Inc. (“Advantage”) has
    license agreements with independently owned associate offices
    (“Associates”), which are responsible for selling and
    marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain
    operational functions, while Paychex and Advantage provide all
    centralized back-office payroll processing and payroll tax
    administration services. Under these arrangements, Advantage
    pays the Associates commissions based on processing activity for
    the related clients. When we acquired Advantage, there were
    fifteen Associates. Over the past few years, some arrangements
    with various Associates have been discontinued, and there are
    currently fewer than ten Associates. Since the actual amounts of
    future payments are uncertain, obligations under these
    arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission
    expense for the Associates for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009
    was $10.4 million, $9.9 million, and
    $12.3 million, respectively.

In the normal course of business, we make representations and
    warranties that guarantee the performance of services under
    service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been
    no material losses related to such guarantees. In addition, we
    have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers
    and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary,
    indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal
    claims as they relate to their services provided to us. We
    guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts
    for clients who financed their service contracts through a third
    party.

We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various
    insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. Our
    estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is
    recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been
    material. We also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our
    purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for
    employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty
    liability, theft and embezzlement, and acts of terrorism; and
    capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our
    captive insurance company.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in
    transactions with unconsolidated entities, which would have been
    established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
    arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain
    investments as a limited partner in low-income housing projects
    that are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These
    investments are accounted for under the equity method of
    accounting and are less than 1% of our total assets as of
    May 31, 2011.

The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2011
    resulted mainly from an increase in net income and fluctuations
    in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in our
    operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 related primarily to lower
    net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating
    assets and liabilities. The increase in non-cash adjustments to
    net income in fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the
    $18.7 million expense charge to increase the litigation
    reserve, partially offset by the related increase in deferred
    tax benefit. The fluctuations in our operating assets and
    liabilities between periods for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010
    were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients
    and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and
    other liabilities.

Funds held for clients and corporate
    investments:

Funds held for clients consist
    of short-term funds and

available-for-sale

securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of

available-for-sale

securities. The portfolio of funds held for clients and
    corporate investments is detailed in Note E of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K.

The fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and
    corporate investment activities reflect the changing mix of
    investments. As a result of volatility in the financial markets,
    in September 2008 we divested of any VRDN securities held and
    began to utilize U.S. agency discount notes as our primary
    short-term investment vehicle. U.S. agency discount notes
    are cash equivalents. VRDNs, although priced and traded as
    short-term securities, are classified as

available-for-sale

securities and the cash paid and proceeds received for these
    securities are included in investing activities. As a result of
    the divestiture, the proceeds from sales of

available-for-sale

securities exceeded the purchases of

available-for-sale

securities in fiscal 2009. Much of these proceeds were held as
    cash equivalents in the funds held for clients’ portfolio.
    In November 2009, we began to again invest in select

A-1/P-1-rated

VRDNs, although at considerably lower levels than in the prior
    year. We utilized some of our cash equivalents to purchase these
    VRDNs, and in fiscal 2010 these purchases of

available-for-sale

securities were in excess of funds received from any sales of

available-for-sale

securities. Also in fiscal 2010, more corporate funds have been
    invested in longer-term municipal bonds. In fiscal 2011, we
    continued to increase our investment in VRDNs and the amounts of
    purchases and sales for

available-for-sale

securities increased. However, partially offsetting this impact
    was the related liquidation of cash equivalents and the impact
    on cash equivalents from timing within the funds held for
    clients’ portfolio of remittances versus collections. See
    further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows
    discussion of net change in client fund obligations.

In general, fluctuations in net funds held for clients and
    corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of
    purchases, sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of
    funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of
    collection of client funds, and the related remittance of funds
    to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax
    administration services and to employees of clients utilizing
    employee payment services. Additional discussion of interest
    rates and related risks is included in the “Market Risk
    Factors” section, contained in Item 7A of this

Form 10-K.

Purchases of long-lived assets:

To
    support our continued client and ancillary product growth,
    purchases of property and equipment were made for data
    processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and
    upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal years
    2011, 2010, and 2009, we purchased approximately
    $5.7 million, $3.2 million, and $4.5 million,
    respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC
    Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive
    Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board of Directors
    (the “Board”).

During fiscal 2011, we paid $126.4 million for the
    acquisitions of SurePayroll and ePlan. During fiscal 2010, we
    received $13.1 million from the sale of Stromberg, an
    immaterial component of the Company. The purchases of other
    assets were for customer lists.

Net change in client fund
    obligations:

The client fund obligations
    liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client
    funds, and the related required remittance of funds to
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax
    administration services and to employees of clients utilizing
    employee payment services. Collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The outflow of funds for
    fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is the result of timing
    of collections and remittances surrounding the Federal holiday
    on May 31, 2010, offset by an increase in client fund
    obligations for higher withholdings for state unemployment
    insurance related to rate increases for calendar year 2011. As a
    result of May 31, 2010 being a Federal holiday, client fund
    obligations were higher as collections were made on Friday,
    May 28, 2010 that were not remitted to client employees and
    tax or regulatory agencies until June 2010. This resulted in a
    positive cash flow impact for fiscal 2010. Also, for fiscal 2010
    there was an increase in client fund obligations as a result of
    higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to
    rate increases for the 2010 calendar year. May 31, 2011 did
    not fall on a Federal holiday, so we did not have the same level
    of client fund holdings at the end of fiscal 2011.

Dividends paid:

A quarterly dividend of
    $0.31 per share was paid to stockholders of record during fiscal
    years 2011, 2010, and 2009. The dividends paid as a percentage
    of net income totaled 87%, 94%, and 84% for those respective
    fiscal years. The payment of future dividends is dependent on
    our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the
    discretion of our Board.

Exercise of stock options:

Proceeds
    from exercise and excess tax benefit related to stock-based
    awards increased for fiscal 2011 and decreased for fiscal 2010
    as compared to the respective prior years. Common shares
    acquired through exercise of stock options were 0.4 million
    shares for each of fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009. The
    increase for fiscal 2011 was the result of a higher average
    exercise price than for fiscal 2010. Refer to Note D of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

    incentive plans.

for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    contained in Item 8 of this Form

10-K,

discusses the significant accounting policies of Paychex. Our
    discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
    of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
    GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
    to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses.
    On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and
    estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements.
    We base our estimates on



historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions
    believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances.
    Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates.
    Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our
    results of operations or financial position are discussed below.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenue is
    recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
    service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
    or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Certain processing services are provided under annual service
    arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
    service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to
    payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a
    fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per
    processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction
    processed. The revenue earned from delivery service for the
    distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is
    included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are
    included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
    Income.

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net
    of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes,
    benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct
    costs billed and incurred were $3.9 billion for fiscal
    2011, $3.1 billion for fiscal 2010, and $2.6 billion
    for fiscal 2009.

Revenue from Stromberg time and attendance solutions was
    recognized during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 until the date of
    disposition, when all of the following were present: persuasive
    evidence that an arrangement existed, typically a non-cancelable
    sales order; delivery was complete for the software and
    hardware; the fee was fixed or determinable and free of
    contingencies; and collectibility was reasonably assured.
    Maintenance contracts were generally purchased by our clients in
    conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance
    solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts was
    recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
    that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
    administration services and for employee payment services, and
    invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on
    these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and
    remitting of these funds are critical components of providing
    these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes
    net realized gains and losses from the sales of

available-for-sale

securities.

PEO workers’ compensation
    insurance:

Workers’ compensation
    insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated
    costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves
    include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those
    claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain
    expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In
    establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves,
    we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future
    cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
    and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
    actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
    multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal
    liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially
    impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial
    statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from
    our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not
    occur until well into the future.

We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’
    compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously
    established reserves are reflected in our results of operations
    for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such
    adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
    variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

Our maximum individual claims liability was $1.0 million
    under both the fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 policies. As of
    May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010, we had recorded current
    liabilities of $7.3 million and $5.8 million,
    respectively, and long-term liabilities of $20.6 million
    and $20.1 million, respectively, for workers’
    compensation claims.

Goodwill and other intangible
    assets:

We have $513.7 million and
    $421.6 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010,
    respectively, resulting from acquisitions of



businesses. The increase in goodwill was due to the acquisition
    in fiscal 2011 of two software-as-a-service companies, whose
    results are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment on
    an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
    circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a
    potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.
    Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including
    goodwill. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result,
    substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one
    reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment testing in our
    fiscal fourth quarter. Based on the results of our reviews, no
    impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for
    fiscal year 2011, 2010 or 2009. Subsequent to this review, there
    have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential
    impairment of our goodwill balance.

We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable.

Stock-based compensation costs:

All
    stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock
    options, are recognized as compensation costs in our
    consolidated financial statements based on their fair values
    measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of
    stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
    This model requires various assumptions as inputs including
    expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected
    option life. We estimate volatility based on a combination of
    historical volatility using weekly stock prices over a period
    equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility.
    Expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise
    behavior.

We are required to estimate forfeitures and only record
    compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest.
    Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of
    award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are
    adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified
    with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the
    final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to
    equal actual forfeitures.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in our results of operations.

We have determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
    as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application,
    is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option
    grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our
    choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model
    if additional information becomes available in the future
    indicating that another model would provide a more accurate
    estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants
    would warrant such a change.

Income taxes:

We account for deferred
    taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
    included in the consolidated financial statements or tax
    returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are determined based on the difference between the financial
    statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
    tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to
    the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain
    stock-based awards. At the time of exercise of non-qualified
    stock options or vesting of stock awards, we account for the
    resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax
    liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any
    excess tax benefit increasing additional paid-in capital. We
    currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in
    additional paid-in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits
    related to stock-based awards.

We maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate
    tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for
    recognition in our consolidated financial statements. Prior to
    recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial
    statements, we must conclude that tax positions must be
    more-likely-than-not to be sustained, assuming those positions
    will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of
    all relevant information. The benefit recognized in our
    consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to
    realize after



examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below
    the more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be
    recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are
    required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has
    been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in
    determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of
    the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact our
    results of operations or financial position. Our reserve for
    uncertain tax positions was $34.4 million as of
    May 31, 2011 and $27.5 million as of May 31,
    2010. Refer to Note I of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this
    Form 10-K, for further discussion of our reserve for
    uncertain tax positions.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk Factors

Changes in interest rates and interest rate
    risk:

Funds held for clients are primarily
    comprised of short-term funds and

available-for-sale

securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of

available-for-sale

securities. As a result of our operating and investing
    activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may
    materially affect our results of operations and financial
    position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings
    potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in
    the fair value of our longer-term

available-for-sale

securities. We follow an investment strategy of optimizing
    liquidity and protecting principal. We invest primarily in high
    credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term
    securities with

A-1/P-1

ratings, with more than 95% of our portfolio rated AA or better.
    We invest predominately in municipal bonds — general
    obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a
    U.S. government escrow; and essential services revenue
    bonds. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single
    issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments
    whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We
    manage the

available-for-sale

securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three
    years. All investments held as of May 31, 2011 were traded
    in active markets.

Starting in November 2009 we began to invest in select

A-1/P-1-rated

VRDNs and have gradually increased our investment in VRDNs to
    $828.3 million as of May 31, 2011, up from
    $226.3 million as of May 31, 2010. During fiscal 2011,
    we earned an after-tax rate of approximately 0.23% for VRDNs
    compared to approximately 0.06% for U.S. agency discount
    notes, which have been our primary short-term investment
    vehicle. We have no exposure to high-risk or illiquid
    investments such as auction rate securities,

sub-prime

mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed
    commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash
    or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles
    (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial
    instruments to manage our interest rate risk.

During fiscal 2011, the average interest rate earned on our
    combined funds held for clients and corporate investment
    portfolios was 1.3%, compared with 1.5% for fiscal 2010 and 2.1%
    for fiscal 2009. When interest rates are falling, the full
    impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected
    in net income due to the interaction of short- and long-term
    interest rate changes. During a falling interest rate
    environment, the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings
    from our short-term investments, and over time decrease earnings
    from our longer-term

available-for-sale

securities. Earnings from the

available-for-sale-securities,

which as of May 31, 2011 had an average duration of
    2.4 years, would not reflect decreases in interest rates
    until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are
    reinvested at lower rates. In the next twelve months, slightly
    more than 20% of our

available-for-sale

portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that
    these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest
    rate of approximately 1.0%.



The amortized cost and fair value of

available-for-sale

securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2011
    are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can
    differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have
    the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

VRDNs are primarily categorized as due after five years in the
    table above as the contractual maturities on these securities
    are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are
    issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as
    short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through
    the tender feature.

The Federal Funds rate was a range of zero to 0.25% as of
    May 31, 2011, May 31, 2010, and May 31, 2009.

Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates
    involves many factors. These factors include, but are not
    limited to:

•

daily interest rate changes;

•

seasonal variations in investment balances;

•

actual duration of short-term and

available-for-sale

securities;

•

the proportional mix of taxable and tax-exempt investments;

•

changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment
    rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous; and

•

financial market volatility and the resulting effect on
    benchmark and other indexing interest rates.

Subject to these factors and under normal financial market
    conditions, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates
    generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately
    17 basis points.

Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and
    corporate investments) averaged approximately $4.0 billion
    for fiscal 2011. Our anticipated allocation is approximately 50%
    invested in short-term securities and

available-for-sale

securities with an average duration of less than 30 days,
    and 50% invested in

available-for-sale

securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three
    years.



The combined funds held for clients and corporate

available-for-sale

securities reflected a net unrealized gain of $59.3 million
    as of May 31, 2011, compared with an unrealized gain of
    $66.6 million as of May 31, 2010. In determining fair
    value, we utilize the Interactive Data Pricing Service. During
    fiscal 2011, the net unrealized gain on our investment
    portfolios ranged from $41.4 million to $86.2 million.
    During fiscal 2010, the net unrealized gain on our investment
    portfolios ranged from $55.1 million to $82.4 million.
    The net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was
    approximately $57.5 million as of July 11, 2011.

As of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010, we had
    $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, invested
    in

available-for-sale

securities at fair value. The weighted-average

yield-to-maturity

was 2.6% and 2.9% as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010,
    respectively. The weighted-average

yield-to-maturity

excludes

available-for-sale

securities tied to short-term interest rates such as the VRDNs
    held as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010. Assuming a
    hypothetical decrease in both short-term and longer-term
    interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential
    increase in fair value for our portfolio of

available-for-sale

securities as of May 31, 2011, would be approximately
    $11.5 million. Conversely, a corresponding increase in
    interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair
    value. This hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value
    of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the
    portfolio’s recorded value, with an offsetting amount
    recorded in stockholders’ equity. These fluctuations in
    fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the
    results of operations, unless any declines in fair value were
    considered to be

other-than-temporary

and an impairment loss recognized.

Credit risk:

We are exposed to credit
    risk in connection with these investments through the possible
    inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We
    regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any
    investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential
    valuation concerns. We believe that the investments we held as
    of May 31, 2011 were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired. While $51.7 million of our

available-for-sale

securities had fair values that were below amortized cost, we
    believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will
    be collected in accordance with the contractual terms, and that
    the unrealized loss of $0.1 million was due to changes in
    interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other
    valuation concerns. All of the securities in an unrealized loss
    position as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010 held an
    AA rating or better. We intend to hold these investments until
    the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity, and
    further believe that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not
    be required to sell these investments prior to that time. Our
    assessment that an investment is not

other-than-temporarily

impaired could change in the future due to new developments or
    changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any
    particular investment.

REPORT ON
    MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Paychex, Inc. (the “Company”) is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system
    of internal control over financial reporting as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Our internal control over
    financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits
    and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and
    guidelines, and careful selection and training of qualified
    personnel.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and
    even when determined to be effective, can only provide
    reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
    preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

The Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors
    meets with the independent registered public accounting firm
    (the “independent accountants”), management, and
    internal auditors periodically to discuss internal control over
    financial reporting and auditing and financial reporting
    matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent
    accountants the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit
    Committee also meets periodically with the independent
    accountants and the chief internal auditor without management
    present to ensure that the independent accountants and the chief
    internal auditor have free access to the Audit Committee. The
    Audit Committee’s Report can be found in the Definitive
    Proxy Statement to be issued in connection with the
    Company’s 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
    2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
    set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission in “Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework.” Based on our assessment, management
    believes that the Company maintained effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of May 31, 2011.

The Company’s independent accountants, Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, are
    appointed by its Audit Committee. Ernst & Young LLP
    has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial
    Statements of Paychex, Inc. and the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The
    reports of the independent accountants are contained in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

and Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited Paychex, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 31, 2011, based on criteria
    established in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    Paychex, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on
    Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Paychex, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of May 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2011 and 2010,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended May 31, 2011 of Paychex, Inc.,
    and our report dated July 15, 2011, expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

and Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Paychex, Inc. as of May 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
    Paychex, Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Paychex, Inc. at May 31, 2011 and
    2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Paychex, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of May 31, 2011, based on criteria established in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated July 15, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A —

Description
    of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of business:

Paychex, Inc.
    and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company” or
    “Paychex”) is a leading provider of payroll, human
    resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to
    medium-sized businesses in the United States (“U.S.”).
    The Company also has a subsidiary in Germany.

Paychex, a Delaware corporation formed in 1979, reports as one
    segment. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is
    generated within the U.S. The Company also generates
    revenue within Germany, which was less than one percent of its
    total revenue for each of the years ended May 31, 2011
    (“fiscal 2011”), 2010 (“fiscal 2010”), and
    2009 (“fiscal 2009”). Long-lived assets in Germany are
    insignificant in relation to total long-lived assets of the
    Company as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010.

Total revenue is comprised of service revenue and interest on
    funds held for clients. Service revenue is comprised of the
    Payroll and Human Resource Services portfolios of services and
    products. Payroll service revenue is earned primarily from
    payroll processing, payroll tax administration services,
    employee payment services, and other ancillary services. Payroll
    processing services include the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; preparation of
    federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
    and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations.

In connection with the automated payroll tax administration
    services, the Company electronically collects payroll taxes from
    clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepares and
    files the applicable tax returns, and remits taxes to the
    applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due
    dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and
    30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The Company handles
    regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest
    disputes, and is subject to cash penalties imposed by tax or
    regulatory agencies for late filings and late or under payment
    of taxes. With employee payment services, employers are offered
    the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll
    debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account
    (Readychex

®

),

    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by Paychex. For the first three methods,
    Paychex electronically collects net payroll from the
    clients’ bank accounts, typically one business day before
    payday, and provides payment to the employees on payday.

In addition to service fees paid by clients, the Company earns
    interest on funds held for clients that are collected before due
    dates and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or
    regulatory agencies or client employees. The funds held for
    clients and related client fund obligations are included in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as current assets and current
    liabilities. The amount of funds held for clients and related
    client fund obligations varies significantly during the year.

The Human Resource Services portfolio of services and products
    provides small- to medium-sized businesses with retirement
    services administration, insurance services, eServices, and
    other human resource services and products. Paychex HR Solutions
    is available as an administrative services organization
    (“ASO”) and a professional employer organization
    (“PEO”). Both options provide a combined package of
    services that include payroll, employer compliance, human
    resource and employee benefits administration, risk management
    outsourcing, and the

on-site

availability of a professionally trained human resource services
    representative. These comprehensive bundles of services are
    designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their
    payroll and related benefits costs while providing a benefits
    package equal to that of larger companies. The PEO differs from
    the ASO in that Paychex serves as a co-employer of the
    clients’ employees, assumes the risks and rewards of
    workers’ compensation insurance, and provides health care
    coverage to PEO client employees. PEO services are sold through
    the Company’s registered and licensed subsidiary, Paychex
    Business Solutions, Inc. Paychex HR Essentials is a new ASO
    product that provides support to the Company’s clients over
    the phone or online to help manage employee-related topics.

Basis of presentation:

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Paychex, Inc. and
    its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential
    recognition

and/or

disclosure through the date of issuance of these financial
    statements.

Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash and
    cash equivalents consist of available cash, money market
    securities, U.S. agency discount notes, and other
    investments with a maturity of three months or less at
    acquisition.

Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful
    accounts:

Accounts receivable balances are
    shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance
    for doubtful accounts of $2.1 million as of May 31,
    2011 and $1.9 million as of May 31, 2010. Accounts
    receivable are written off and charged against the allowance for
    doubtful accounts when the Company has exhausted all collection
    efforts without success. No single client had a material impact
    on total accounts receivable, service revenue, or results of
    operations.

Funds held for clients and corporate
    investments:

Marketable securities included
    in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist
    primarily of securities classified as

available-for-sale

and are recorded at fair value obtained from an independent
    pricing service. The funds held for clients portfolio also
    includes cash, money market securities, and short-term
    investments. Unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable
    income taxes, are reported as comprehensive income in the
    Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Realized
    gains and losses on the sale of

available-for-sale

securities are determined by specific identification of the cost
    basis of each security. On the Consolidated Statements of
    Income, realized gains and losses from their respective
    portfolios are included in interest on funds held for clients
    and investment income, net.

Concentrations:

Substantially all of
    the Company’s deposited cash is maintained at two large
    credit-worthy financial institutions. These deposits may exceed
    the amount of any insurance provided. All of the Company’s
    deliverable securities are held in custody with one of the two
    aforementioned financial institutions, for which that
    institution bears the risk of custodial loss. Non-deliverable
    securities, primarily time deposits and money market mutual
    funds, are restricted to credit-worthy financial institutions.

Property and equipment, net of accumulated
    depreciation:

Property and equipment is
    stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
    Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of property
    and equipment using the straight-line method. The estimated
    useful lives of depreciable assets are generally:

Category

Depreciable life

Buildings and improvements

Ten to 35 years or the remaining life, whichever is shorter

Data processing equipment

Two to seven years

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment

Seven years

Leasehold improvements

Ten years or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter

Normal and recurring repairs and maintenance costs are charged
    to expense as incurred. The Company reviews the carrying value
    of property and equipment for impairment when events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets
    may not be recoverable.

Software development and
    enhancements:

Expenditures for software
    purchases and software developed for internal use are
    capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives, which are generally three to fifteen
    years. For software developed for internal use, certain costs
    are capitalized, including external direct costs of materials
    and services associated with developing or obtaining the
    software, and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees
    who are directly associated with internal-use software projects.
    Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at
    which the project is substantially complete and ready for its
    intended use. Costs associated with preliminary project stage
    activities, training, maintenance, and other post-implementation
    stage activities are expensed as incurred. The carrying value of
    software and development costs is reviewed for impairment when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of such assets may not be recoverable.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated
    amortization:

The Company has recorded
    goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of businesses.
    Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment on
    an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
    circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a
    potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit.
    Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including
    goodwill. The Company’s business is largely homogeneous
    and, as a result, substantially all the goodwill is associated
    with one reporting unit. The Company performs its annual
    impairment testing in its fiscal fourth quarter. Based on the
    results of the Company’s reviews, no impairment loss was
    recognized in the results of operations for fiscal years 2011,
    2010, or 2009. Subsequent to the latest review, there have been
    no events or circumstances that indicate any potential
    impairment of the Company’s goodwill balance.

Intangible assets are comprised primarily of client list
    acquisitions and are reported net of accumulated amortization on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Intangible assets are amortized
    over periods generally ranging from five to twelve years using
    either the straight-line method, an accelerated method, or based
    on client attrition. The Company tests intangible assets for
    potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be
    recoverable.

Revenue recognition:

Service revenue is
    recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under
    service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed
    or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Certain processing services are provided under annual service
    arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual
    service period. The Company’s service revenue is largely
    attributable to payroll-related processing services where the
    fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed
    amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or
    transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service
    for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and
    reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the
    delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net
    of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes,
    benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct
    costs billed and incurred were $3.9 billion for fiscal
    2011, $3.1 billion for fiscal 2010, and $2.6 billion
    for fiscal 2009.

Revenue from Stromberg time and attendance solutions was
    recognized during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 until the date of
    disposition, when all of the following were present: persuasive
    evidence that an arrangement existed, typically a non-cancelable
    sales order; delivery was complete for the software and
    hardware; the fee was fixed or determinable and free of
    contingencies; and collectibility was reasonably assured.
    Maintenance contracts were generally purchased by the
    Company’s clients in conjunction with their purchase of
    certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these
    maintenance contracts was recognized ratably over the term of
    the contract.

Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds
    that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax
    administration services and for employee payment services, and
    invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are
    typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with
    some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on
    these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated
    Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and
    remitting of these funds are components of providing these
    services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net
    realized gains and losses from the sales of

available-for-sale

securities.

Advantage Payroll Services Inc. (“Advantage”), a
    subsidiary of the Company, has license agreements with
    independently owned associate offices (“Associates”).
    The Associates are responsible for selling and marketing
    Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational
    functions. Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized
    back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration
    services for the Associates, including the billing and
    collection of processing fees and the collection and remittance
    of payroll and payroll tax funds pursuant to Advantage’s
    service arrangement with Associate customers. The marketing and
    selling by the Associates is



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

conducted under their respective logos. Commissions earned by
    the Associates are based on the processing activity for the
    related clients. Revenue generated from customers as a result of
    these relationships and commissions paid to Associates are
    included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as service
    revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses,
    respectively.

PEO workers’ compensation
    insurance:

Workers’ compensation
    insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated
    costs of paying claims underwritten by the Company. These
    reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for
    those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain
    expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In
    establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves,
    the Company uses an independent actuarial estimate of
    undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle
    the claims.

Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain
    and complex process based upon historical loss experience and
    actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to
    multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal
    liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially
    impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial
    statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from
    the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not
    occur until well into the future.

The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated
    workers’ compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to
    previously established reserves are reflected in the results of
    operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified.
    Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
    variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

The Company’s maximum individual claims liability was
    $1.0 million under both its fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010
    policies. As of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010, the
    Company had recorded current liabilities of $7.3 million
    and $5.8 million, respectively, and long-term liabilities
    of $20.6 million and $20.1 million, respectively, on
    its Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation
    claims.

Stock-based compensation costs:

All
    stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock
    options, are recognized as compensation costs in the
    consolidated financial statements based on their fair values
    measured as of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair
    value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs
    including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and
    expected option life. Volatility is estimated based on a
    combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices
    over a period equal to the expected option life and implied
    market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on
    historical exercise behavior.

The Company is required to estimate forfeitures and only record
    compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest.
    The assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of
    award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are
    adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified
    with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the
    final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to
    equal actual forfeitures.

The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and
    forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to
    change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise
    behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions
    of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these
    assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair
    value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs
    recognized in the Company’s results of operations.

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its
    application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of
    stock option grants. The Company periodically reassesses its
    assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will
    reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes
    available in the future indicating that another model would
    provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if
    characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Refer to Note D for further discussion of the
    Company’s stock-based compensation plans.

Income taxes:

The Company accounts for
    deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and
    liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
    that have been included in the consolidated financial statements
    or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based on the difference between the
    financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities
    using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a
    deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs
    recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of the
    exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of stock
    awards, the Company accounts for the resulting tax deduction by
    reducing its accrued income tax liability with an offset to the
    deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing
    additional paid-in capital. The Company currently has a
    sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in
    capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to
    stock-based awards.

The Company maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions. The
    Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
    a tax return for recognition in its consolidated financial
    statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in the
    consolidated financial statements, the Company must conclude
    that tax positions must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained,
    assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities
    with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit
    recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the
    amount the Company expects to realize after examination by
    taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the
    more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be
    recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are
    required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has
    been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in
    determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of
    the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact the
    Company’s results of operations or financial position. The
    Company’s reserve for uncertain tax positions was
    $34.4 million as of May 31, 2011 and
    $27.5 million as of May 31, 2010. Refer to Note I
    for further discussion of the Company’s reserve for
    uncertain tax positions.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires
    management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that
    affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts and results
    could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior period
    amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period
    presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported
    consolidated earnings.

Recently adopted accounting
    pronouncements:

Effective June 1, 2010,
    the Company adopted the following Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) authoritative guidance, neither of
    which had a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements:

•

Guidance amending the accounting and reporting standards for
    transfers and servicing of financial assets, including the
    removal of the concept of a qualifying special purpose
    entity; and

•

Guidance to require a qualitative analysis rather than a
    quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation to determine
    the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”) for consolidation purposes. This qualitative
    approach focuses on identifying which entity has the power to
    direct the activities of a VIE with the most significant impact
    on the VIE’s economic performance.

Recently issued accounting
    pronouncements:

In December 2010, the FASB
    issued updated guidance on when and how to perform certain steps
    of the periodic goodwill impairment test for public entities
    that may have reporting units with zero or negative carrying
    amounts. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and
    interim periods within those years, beginning after
    December 15, 2010, with early adoption prohibited. It is
    applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    June 1, 2011. The Company is currently evaluating this
    guidance, but does not expect its adoption will have a material
    effect on its consolidated financial statements.



PAYCHEX,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2010, the FASB also issued guidance to clarify the
    reporting of pro forma financial information related to business
    combinations of public entities and to expand certain
    supplemental pro forma disclosures. This guidance is effective
    prospectively for business combinations that occur on or after
    the beginning of the fiscal year beginning on or after
    December 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. It is
    applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    June 1, 2011. The Company is currently evaluating this
    guidance, but does not expect its adoption will have a material
    effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to amend certain
    measurement and disclosure requirements related to fair value
    measurements to improve consistency with international reporting
    standards. This guidance is effective prospectively for public
    entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
    after December 15, 2011, with early adoption by public
    entities prohibited, and is applicable to the Company’s
    fiscal quarter beginning March 1, 2012. The Company is
    currently evaluating this guidance, but does not expect its
    adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated
    financial statements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation
    of comprehensive income that will require a company to present
    components of net income and other comprehensive income in one
    continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive
    statements. There are no changes to the components that are
    recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under
    current GAAP. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and
    interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
    December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. It is
    applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    June 1, 2012. The Company is currently evaluating this
    guidance, but does not expect its adoption will have a material
    effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Other recent authoritative guidance issued by the FASB
    (including technical corrections to the FASB Accounting
    Standards Codification), the American Institute of Certified
    Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) did not, or are not expected to have a
    material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Business
    Combinations

During fiscal 2011, the Company acquired two
    software-as-a-service companies, opening up additional areas of
    the markets the Company serves. Effective February 8, 2011,
    the Company acquired SurePayroll, Inc.
    (“SurePayroll”), a payroll processing provider for
    small businesses, for $114.9 million, net of cash acquired.
    The acquisition of SurePayroll allows the Company entry into a
    new area of the online market for small businesses, and resulted
    in approximately $84.6 million of goodwill, which is not
    tax-deductible.

Effective May 3, 2011, the Company acquired ePlan Services,
    Inc. (“ePlan”), a provider of recordkeeping and
    administrative solutions to the defined contribution
    marketplace, for $15.2 million, net of cash acquired. The
    ePlan acquisition resulted in $7.5 million of goodwill,
    which is not tax-deductible.

Upon their respective closing dates, both entities acquired
    became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The financial
    results of SurePayroll and ePlan are included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements from their
    respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions are not
    material to the Company’s results of operations, financial
    position, or cash flows.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

The Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and
    restated (the “2002 Plan”), effective on
    October 13, 2010 upon its approval by the Company’s
    stockholders, authorizes grants of up to 39.1 million
    shares of the Company’s common stock. As of May 31,
    2011, there were 24.8 million shares available for future
    grants under the 2002 Plan. No future grants will be made
    pursuant to the Paychex, Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, which
    expired in August 2002; however, options to purchase an
    aggregate of 1.0 million shares under the plan remain
    outstanding as of May 31, 2011.

All stock-based awards to employees are recognized as
    compensation costs in the consolidated financial statements
    based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant.
    These costs are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period and increase additional paid-in capital. Grants
    prior to June 1, 2006 were expensed on an accelerated basis.

Stock-based compensation expense was $24.8 million,
    $25.6 million, and $25.7 million for fiscal years
    2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Related income tax benefits
    recognized were $8.4 million, $7.9 million, and
    $8.0 million for the respective fiscal years. Capitalized
    stock-based compensation costs related to the development of
    internal use software for these same fiscal years were not
    significant.

As of May 31, 2011, the total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to all unvested stock-based awards was
    $36.9 million and is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 2.7 years.

Stock option grants:

Stock option
    grants entitle the holder to purchase, at the end of the vesting
    term, a specified number of shares of Paychex common stock at an
    exercise price per share set equal to the closing market price
    of the common stock on the date of grant. All stock option
    grants have a contractual life of ten years from the date of the
    grant and a vesting schedule as established by the Board of
    Directors (the “Board”). The Company issues new shares
    of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises. Non-qualified
    stock option grants to officers and outside directors are
    typically approved by the Board in July. Non-qualified stock
    option grants to officers and employees granted prior to July
    2010 vest 20% per annum, while grants to the Board prior to
    October 2010 vest one-third per annum. Grants on non-qualified
    stock options to officers beginning in July 2010 vest 25% per
    annum. Grants to members of the Board beginning in October 2010
    vest after one year.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of stock option grants was estimated at the date
    of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    weighted-average assumptions used for valuation under the
    Black-Scholes model are as follows:

Year ended May 31,

Expected option life in years

6.5

Risk-free interest rates are yields for zero coupon
    U.S. Treasury notes maturing approximately at the end of
    the expected option life. The estimated volatility factor is
    based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly
    stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and
    implied market volatility. The expected option life is based on
    historical exercise behavior.

The Company has determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its
    application, are appropriate in estimating the fair value of its
    stock option grants. The Company periodically assesses its
    assumptions as well as its choice of valuation model, and will
    reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes
    available in the future indicating that another model would
    provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if
    characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.

Restricted stock awards:

The Board has
    approved grants of restricted stock awards to the Company’s
    officers and outside directors in accordance with the 2002 Plan.
    All shares underlying awards of restricted stock are restricted
    in that they are not transferable until they vest. The
    recipients of the restricted stock have voting rights and earn
    dividends, which are paid to the recipient at the time of
    vesting of the awards. If the recipient leaves Paychex prior to
    the vesting date for any reason, the shares of restricted stock
    and the dividends accrued on those shares will be forfeited and
    returned to Paychex.

For restricted stock awards granted to officers prior to July
    2010, the shares vest upon the fifth anniversary of the grant
    date provided the recipient is still an employee of the Company
    on that date. These awards have a provision for the acceleration
    of vesting based on achievement of performance targets
    established by the Board. If the established targets are met for
    a fiscal year, up to one-third of the award may vest. If all the
    targets are met for three consecutive years, the award will be
    fully vested. Beginning in July 2010, time-vested restricted
    stock awards were granted to officers, which vest one-third per
    annum over three years. For grants to outside directors prior to
    October 2010, the shares vest on the third anniversary of the
    grant date. Beginning in October, 2010, restricted stock granted
    to outside directors vest on the one-year anniversary of the
    grant date. The fair value of restricted stock awards is equal
    to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of
    the date of grant and is expensed over the requisite service
    period on a straight-line basis.

Restricted stock units:

Beginning in

    (“RSUs”) to non-officer management as a replacement of
    non-qualified stock options. RSUs do not have voting rights or
    earn dividend equivalents during the vesting period. These
    awards vest 20% per annum over five years with a small
    population of awards vesting on the fourth anniversary of the
    grant date. The fair value of RSUs is equal to the closing
    market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of
    grant, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends over

Performance shares:

Beginning in July
    2010, the Board approved grants of performance shares to
    officers and directors. These awards have a two-year performance
    period, after which the amount of restricted shares earned will
    be determined based on achievement against performance targets
    established at the time of Board approval of the awards. The
    restricted shares earned will then be subject to a one-year
    service period until the restrictions lapse. Performance shares
    do not have voting rights or earn dividend equivalents during
    the performance period. The fair value of performance shares is
    equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock
    as of the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of
    expected dividends over the performance period.

Non-compensatory employee benefit
    plan:

The Company offers an Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan to all employees under which the Company’s
    common stock can be purchased through a payroll deduction with
    no discount to the market price and no look-back provision. All
    transactions occur directly through the Company’s transfer
    agent and no brokerage fees are charged to employees, except for
    when stock is sold. The plan has been deemed non-compensatory
    and therefore, no stock-based compensation costs have been
    recognized for fiscal years 2011, 2010, or 2009 related to this
    plan.

    investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet
    the terms of their bonds. In addition, the Company is exposed to
    interest rate risk, as rate volatility will cause fluctuations
    in the fair value of held investments and in the earnings
    potential of future investments. The Company’s investment
    strategy focuses on optimizing liquidity and protecting
    principal. The Company invests primarily in high credit quality
    securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities
    with

A-1/P-1

ratings. It limits the amounts that can be invested in any
    single issuer, and invests in short- to intermediate-term
    instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate
    changes. All the investments held as of May 31, 2011 were
    traded in active markets. The Company has not and does not
    utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate
    risk.

The Company’s

The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolios to
    determine if any investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential
    valuation concerns. The Company believes that the investments
    held as of May 31, 2011 were not

other-than-temporarily

impaired. While $51.7 million of

available-for-sale

securities had fair values that were below amortized cost, the
    Company believes that it is probable that the principal and
    interest will be collected in accordance with contractual terms,
    and that the unrealized loss on these securities of
    $0.1 million was due to changes in interest rates and was
    not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns.
    All of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of
    May 31, 2011 and 2010 held an AA rating or better. The
    Company intends to hold these investments until the recovery of
    their amortized cost basis or maturity, and further believes
    that it is more-likely-than-not that it will not be required to
    sell these investments prior to that time. The Company’s
    assessment that an investment is not

other-than-temporarily

impaired could change in the future due to new developments or
    changes in the Company’s strategies or assumptions related
    to any particular investment.

    are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are

Fair
    Value Measurements

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and accounts
    payable approximate fair value due to the short maturities of
    these instruments. Marketable securities included in funds held
    for clients and corporate investments consist primarily of
    securities classified as

available-for-sale

and are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.

The accounting standards related to fair value measurements
    include a hierarchy for information and valuations used in
    measuring fair value that is broken down into three levels based
    on reliability, as follows:

•

Level 1 valuations are based on quoted prices in active
    markets for identical instruments that the Company has the
    ability to access.

•

Level 2 valuations are based on quoted prices for similar,
    but not identical, instruments in active markets; quoted prices
    for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
    active; or other significant observable inputs besides quoted
    prices.

•

Level 3 valuations are based on information that is
    unobservable and significant to the overall fair value
    measurement.

In determining the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the
    Company predominately uses the market approach. In determining
    the fair value of its

available-for-sale

securities, the Company utilizes the Interactive Data Pricing
    service. Other securities are mutual fund investments,
    consisting of participants’ eligible deferral contributions
    under the Company’s non-qualified and unfunded deferred
    compensation plans. The related liability is reported as other
    long-term liabilities. The mutual funds are valued based on
    quoted market prices in active markets.

The preceding methods described may produce a fair value
    calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value
    or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the
    Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
    consistent with other market participants, the use of different
    methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
    certain financial instruments could result in a different fair
    value measurement at the reporting date.

The Company had goodwill balances on its Consolidated Balance

    $421.6 million as of May 31, 2010. The increase in
    goodwill since May 31, 2010 was the result of the
    acquisition of two software-as-a-service companies in fiscal
    2011. The acquisition of SurePayroll resulted in
    $84.6 million of goodwill and the acquisition of ePlan
    resulted in $7.5 million of goodwill.

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, numerous
    local and state tax jurisdictions within the U.S., and income
    taxes in Germany.

The Company believes the reserve for uncertain tax positions of
    $34.4 million as of May 31, 2011 adequately covers
    open tax years and uncertain tax positions up to and including
    fiscal 2011 for major taxing jurisdictions. As of May 31,
    2011, $29.2 million of the $34.4 million of
    unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the
    Company’s effective income tax rate. As of May 31,
    2010, substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits, if
    recognized, would impact the Company’s effective income tax
    rate.

A significant portion of the reserve relates to uncertain tax
    positions currently under audit by New York state for the
    fiscal year ended May 31, 2004 (“fiscal 2004”)
    through fiscal 2009. On July 14, 2010, the Company received
    a summary of proposed tax adjustments for fiscal 2004 through
    the fiscal year ended May 31, 2007 from New York State,
    which was in excess of the reserve recorded as of May 31,
    2011. The ultimate outcome of the unresolved state tax matters
    is uncertain and could be favorable or unfavorable to the
    Company. An unfavorable resolution of the uncertain tax
    positions in total could have a material impact on the
    Company’s results of operations and effective income tax
    rate, and generate additional cash outlays in the period in
    which the unfavorable resolution, if any, was recognized. The
    tax matters that are currently under audit are not expected to
    have a future impact on the Company’s effective income tax
    rate.

The Company has concluded all U.S. federal income tax
    matters through its fiscal year ended May 31, 2008. Fiscal
    2009 and fiscal 2010 are still subject to potential audit. With
    limited exception, state income tax audits by taxing authorities
    are closed through the fiscal year ended May 31, 2006,
    primarily due to expiration of the statute of limitations.

The Company continues to follow its policy of recognizing
    interest and penalties accrued on tax positions as a component
    of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
    amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with the
    Company’s tax positions is immaterial to the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The amount of interest and penalties recognized
    for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009 was immaterial to the
    Company’s results of operations.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

401(k) plan:

The Company maintains a
    contributory savings plan that qualifies under
    section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Paychex,
    Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan (the “Plan”)
    allows all employees to immediately participate in the salary
    deferral portion of the Plan, contributing up to a maximum of
    50% of their salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service
    limitations. Employees who have completed one year of service
    are eligible to receive a company matching contribution, when
    such contribution is in effect. Prior to April 2009, the Company
    matched up to 100% of the first 3% of eligible pay and up to 50%
    of the next 2% of eligible pay that an employee contributed to
    the Plan. Effective April 3, 2009, the Company suspended
    the employer matching contribution. A matching contribution was
    reinstated in the amount of 50% of up to 4% of eligible pay that
    an employee contributes to the Plan for pay dates on or after
    January 1, 2011.

The Plan is 100% participant-directed. Plan participants can
    fully diversify their portfolios by choosing from any or all
    investment fund choices in the Plan. Transfers in and out of
    investment funds, including the Paychex, Inc. Employee Stock
    Ownership Plan (ESOP) Stock Fund, are not restricted, with the
    exception of certain restricted trading periods for individuals
    designated as insiders as specified in the Company’s
    Insider Trading Policy. The Company match contribution, when in
    effect, follows the same fund elections as the employee
    compensation deferrals.

Company contributions to the Plan for fiscal 2011 and fiscal
    2009 were $3.5 million and $14.3 million,
    respectively. There were no Company contributions to the Plan
    for fiscal 2010 due to the suspension of the employer matching
    contribution at that time.

Deferred compensation plans:

The
    Company offers non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation
    plans to a select group of key employees, executive officers,
    and outside directors. Eligible employees are provided with the
    opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and
    bonus and outside directors to defer 100% of their Board cash
    compensation. Gains and losses are credited based on the
    participant’s election of a variety of investment choices.
    The Company does not match any participant deferral or guarantee
    its return. Distributions are

paid at one of the following dates selected by the participant:
    the participant’s termination date, the date the
    participant retires from any active employment, or a designated
    specific date. In fiscal 2009, participants were allowed to make
    a one-time election for a distribution under the Internal
    Revenue Service Section 409A transition rules. The amounts
    accrued under these plans were $8.9 million and
    $7.3 million as of May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2010,
    respectively, and are reflected in other long-term liabilities
    on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note M —

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Lines of credit:

As of May 31,
    2011, the Company had unused borrowing capacity available under
    four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market
    rates of interest with financial institutions as follows:

Financial institution

Amount available

Expiration date

JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.

$350 million

February 2012

Bank of America, N.A.

$250 million

February 2012

PNC Bank, National Association

$150 million

February 2012

Wells Fargo Bank, National Association

$150 million

February 2012

The credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are
    secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between
    Paychex and each of the financial institutions (the
    “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Company has granted
    each of the Lenders a security interest in certain investment
    securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled
    custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and
    is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the
    Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may
    require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account
    into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual
    Lenders.

The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet
    short-term funding requirements related to deposit account
    overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic
    payment transactions on behalf of clients in the ordinary course
    of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against
    these lines of credit during fiscal 2011 or as of May 31,
    2011.

JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. are also
    parties to the Company’s irrevocable standby letters of
    credit, which are discussed below.

Letters of credit:

The Company had
    irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling
    $47.4 million and $50.3 million as of May 31,
    2011 and May 31, 2010, respectively, required to secure
    commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of
    credit expire at various dates between July 2011 and December
    2011, and are collateralized by securities held in the
    Company’s investment portfolios. No amounts were
    outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2011 or as
    of May 31, 2011. Subsequent to May 31, 2011, the
    letter of credit expiring in July 2011 was renewed and will
    expire in July 2012.

Contingencies:

The Company is subject
    to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal
    course of its business. These include disputes or potential
    disputes related to breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
    duty, employment-related claims, tax claims, and other matters.

The Company’s management currently believes that resolution
    of outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent
    uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate
    resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact
    on the Company’s financial position and the results of
    operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.

Lease commitments:

The Company leases
    office space and data processing equipment under terms of
    various operating leases. Rent expense for fiscal years 2011,
    2010, and 2009 was $45.4 million, $46.9 million, and

In the normal course of business, the Company makes
    representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of
    services under service arrangements with clients. Historically,
    there have been no material losses related to such guarantees.
    In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification
    agreements with its officers and directors, which require the
    Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals
    for certain pending or future claims as they relate to their
    services provided to the Company. The Company guarantees
    performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for
    clients who financed their service contracts through a third
    party.

Paychex currently self-insures the deductible portion of various
    insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. The
    Company’s estimated loss exposure under these insurance
    arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued
    have not been material. The Company also maintains insurance
    coverage in addition to its purchased primary insurance policies
    for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and
    omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, and acts
    of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured
    retentions through its captive insurance company.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting:

Disclosure controls
    and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that
    information required to be disclosed in the Company’s
    reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this report, is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure
    controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of
    ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated
    to the Company’s management, including the Company’s
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
    appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures:

As of the end of the
    period covered by this report, the Company carried out an
    evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
    the Company’s principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer, of the effectiveness of disclosure controls
    and procedures as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
    concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this
    report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective.

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
    Reporting:

The Company also carried out an
    evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to
    determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered
    by this report. Based on such evaluation, there has been no
    changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial
    reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently
    completed fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2011, that
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.
