PART I

ITEM 1.          BUSINESS.

(a) General Development of Business

PACCAR Inc (the Company), incorporated under
the laws of Delaware in 1971, is the successor to Pacific Car and Foundry
Company which was incorporated in Washington in 1924. The Company traces
its predecessors to Seattle Car Manufacturing Company formed in 1905.

(b) Financial Information About Industry
Segments and Geographic Areas

Information about the Company’s industry
segments and geographic areas in response to Items 101(b), (c)(1)(i), and
(d) of Regulation S-K appears on page 49 of the Annual Report to Stockholders
for the year ended December 31, 2005 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

The Company has two principal industry
segments, (1) design, manufacture and distribution of light-, medium- and
heavy-duty trucks and related aftermarket distribution of parts and (2) finance
and leasing services provided to customers and dealers. The Company’s finance
and leasing activities are principally related to Company products and
associated equipment. Other manufactured products include industrial winches.

TRUCKS

The Company and its subsidiaries design and
manufacture heavy-duty diesel trucks which are marketed under the Peterbilt,
Kenworth, and DAF nameplates. These vehicles, which are built in four plants in
the United States, three in Europe and one each in Australia, Canada, and
Mexico, are used worldwide for over-the-road and off-highway hauling of
freight, petroleum, wood products, construction and other materials.

The Company, through its Peterbilt and
Kenworth Divisions, competes in the North American medium duty (Class 6/7)
markets primarily with conventional models. These medium-duty trucks are
assembled at the Company’s Ste. Therese, Quebec plant and at the Company’s
facility in Mexicali, Mexico. The Company competes in the European light/medium
(6 to 15 metric ton) commercial vehicle market with DAF cab-over-engine trucks
assembled in the United Kingdom by Leyland, one of the Company’s wholly
owned subsidiaries.

Commercial trucks and related replacement
parts comprise the largest segment of the Company’s business, accounting for
94% of total 2005 net sales and revenues.

Substantially all trucks and related parts
are sold to independent dealers. The Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates are
marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the U.S. and a foreign
subsidiary in Canada. The Kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by
foreign subsidiaries in Mexico and Australia. The DAF nameplate is
marketed and distributed by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the
Netherlands. A U.S. division, PACCAR International, also markets all three
nameplates outside each of their primary markets. The decision to operate
as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to Truck Segment operations
and reflects legal, tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries
where PACCAR operates.


The Truck Segment utilizes centrally managed
purchasing, information technology, technical research and testing, treasury
and finance functions. Certain manufacturing plants in North America produce
trucks for more than one nameplate in common production facilities, while other
plants produce trucks for only one nameplate, depending on various factors.
Also, as a result of the close similarity of the business models
employed by each nameplate, best manufacturing practices within the Company are
shared on a routine basis.

The Company’s trucks are essentially custom
products and have a reputation for high quality. For a significant portion
of the Company’s truck operations, major components, such as engines,
transmissions and axles, as well as a substantial percentage of other
components, are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to PACCAR and
customer specifications. DAF, which is more vertically integrated,
manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other
components for its heavy truck models. The value of truck components
manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 40% in
Europe to approximately 85% in North America.

Raw materials and other components used in
the manufacture of trucks are purchased from a number of suppliers. The
Company’s DAF subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor,
Renault V.I., for its European light-duty product line pursuant to a joint
product development and long-term supply contract. Sales of trucks manufactured
with these cabs amounted to approximately 3% of consolidated revenues in 2005.
A short-term loss of supply, and the resulting interruption in the
production of these trucks, would not have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations. However, a loss of supply for an extended
period of time would either require the Company to contract for an alternative
source of supply or for the Company to manufacture cabs itself. Other than
these components, the Company is not limited to any single source for any
significant component, although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver
components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain
products. No significant shortages of materials or components were experienced
in 2005. Manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and
orders are placed with suppliers accordingly.

Replacement truck parts are sold and
delivered to the Company’s independent dealers through the Company’s parts
distribution network. Parts are both manufactured by the Company and purchased
from various suppliers. Replacement parts inventory levels are determined
largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery. As
a percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues, parts sales were 12%
in 2005 and 2004 and 15% in 2003.

There were three other principal competitors
in the U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck market in 2005. The Company’s share of
that market was 23.1% of retail sales in 2005. The Company’s share of the
Class 6 and 7 truck market in 2005 was 9.2%. In Europe there were five other
principal competitors in the commercial vehicle market in 2005, including
parent companies to two competitors of the Company in the United
States. In 2005, DAF had a 13.7% share of the Western European
heavy-duty market and a 9.4% share of the light/medium market. These markets
are highly competitive in price, quality and service, and PACCAR is not
dependent on any single customer for its sales. There are no significant
seasonal variations in sales.

The Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates
are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of
the Company’s truck products. The Company engages in a continuous program of
trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world.

Although the Company’s truck products are
subject to environmental noise and emission controls, competing manufacturers
are subject to the same controls. The Company believes the cost of complying
with noise and emission controls will not be detrimental to its business.


The Company had a total production backlog of
$5.0 billion at the end of 2005. Within this backlog, orders scheduled for
delivery within three months (90 days) are considered to be
firm. The 90-day backlog approximated $2.5 billion at December 31,
2005, and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2004. Production of the year-end
2005 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2006.

The number of persons employed by the Company
in its truck business at December 31, 2005, was approximately 21,000.

OTHER BUSINESS

The Truck and Other businesses include a
division of the Company which manufactures industrial winches in two U.S.
plants and markets them under the Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic nameplates. The
markets for these products are highly competitive and the Company competes with
a number of well established firms. Sales of industrial winches were less
than 1% of net sales and revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic trademarks
and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the
marketing of those products.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

In North America, Australia and eleven
Western European countries, the Company provides financing and leasing
arrangements, principally for its manufactured trucks, through wholly owned
finance companies operating under the PACCAR Financial or PacLease trade names.
They provide inventory financing for independent dealers selling PACCAR
products, and retail and lease financing for new and used trucks and other
transportation equipment sold principally by its independent dealers.
Receivables are secured by the products financed or leased.

The Company also conducts full service leasing
operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in North America under the
PacLease trade name. Selected dealers in North America are franchised to
provide full service leasing. The Company provides its franchisees equipment
financing and managerial support. The Company also operates full service lease
outlets on its own behalf.

PATENTS

The Company owns numerous patents which
relate to all product lines. Although these patents are considered important to
the overall conduct of the Company’s business, no patent or group of patents is
considered essential to a material part of the Company’s business.

REGULATION

As a manufacturer of highway trucks, the
Company is subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration as well as environmental laws and regulations in
the United States, and is subject to similar regulations in Canada, Mexico,
Australia and Europe. In addition, the Company is subject to certain other
licensing requirements to do business in the United States and Europe. The
Company believes it is in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to
safety standards, the environment and other licensing requirements in all
countries where it has operations.


Information regarding the effects that
compliance with international, federal, state and local provisions regulating
the environment have on the Company’s capital and operating expenditures and
the Company’s involvement in environmental cleanup activities is included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by
reference in Items 7 and 8, respectively.

EMPLOYEES

On December 31, 2005, the Company employed a
total of approximately 21,900 persons.

OTHER DISCLOSURES

The Company’s filings on Form 10-K, 10-Q, and
8-K and any amendments to those reports can be found on the Company’s website www.paccar.com/financials.asp
free of charge as soon as practicable after the report is electronically filed
with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS.

The following are significant risks which could
negatively impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Business and Industry Risks

The commercial truck market demand is
variable.

Demand for commercial vehicles depends to some
extent on economic and other conditions in a given market and the introduction
of new vehicles and technologies. Further, the yearly demand for commercial
vehicles tends to increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic
product in markets the Company serves which are principally North America
and Western Europe. Demand may also be affected by factors impacting new truck
prices such as costs of raw materials and components and cost of compliance
with governmental regulations (including tariffs, engine emissions regulations,
import regulation and other taxes).

The financial services industry is highly
competitive.

The Company competes with banks, other commercial
finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing,
higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer
lower interest rates, which may lead to decreased margins, lower market share
or both. A decline in the Company’s commercial truck unit sales, an
increase in residual value risk due to lower used truck pricing and
increased funding costs are also factors which may negatively affect the
Company’s financial services operations.


The financial services segment is subject to
credit risk.

The financial services segment is exposed
to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer, dealer or
counterparty to meet the terms of the loans, leases and derivative contracts
with the Company. Although the financial assets of the financial services
segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral, in the event a
customer cannot meet its obligations to the Company, there is a risk
that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to
recover the amounts owed to the Company resulting in credit losses.

Political, Regulatory and Economic Risks

The Company’s operations could be subject to
currency and interest rate fluctuations.

The Company’s
consolidated financial statements, which are presented in U.S. dollars, are
affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations through both translation and
transaction risk. The Company uses certain derivative financial instruments and
localized production of its products to reduce, but not eliminate, the
effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The Company may be adversely affected by
political instabilities, fuel shortages or interruptions in transportation
systems, natural calamities, wars, terrorism and labor strikes.

The
Company is subject to various risks associated with conducting business worldwide.

ITEM 2.          PROPERTIES.

The Company and its subsidiaries own and
operate manufacturing plants in five U.S. states, three countries in Europe,
and one each in Australia, Canada and Mexico. The Company also has a number of parts distribution
centers, sales and service offices, and finance and

administrative
offices which are operated in owned or leased premises in these

and other countries. Facilities for product testing
and research and development are located in Washington state and the
Netherlands. The Company’s corporate headquarters is located in owned premises
in Bellevue, Washington. The Company considers all of the properties
used by its businesses to be suitable for their intended
purposes.

Substantially all the Company’s manufacturing
facilities increased their production in 2005 compared to the prior year. The
Company continuously invests in facilities, equipment and processes to provide
manufacturing and warehouse capacity to meet its customers’ needs.


The following summarizes the number of the
Company’s manufacturing plants by geographical location within indicated
industry segments:

ITEM 3.          LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties
to various lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of business. Management
believes that the disposition of such lawsuits will not materially affect the
Company’s business or financial condition.

ITEM 4.          SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF
SECURITY HOLDERS.

No matters were submitted to a vote of
security holders during the fourth quarter of 2005.
