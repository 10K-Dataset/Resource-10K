PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a)

General
Development of Business

PACCAR
Inc (the Company), incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1971, is the successor to Pacific Car and Foundry Company, which was incorporated in Washington in 1924. The
Company traces its predecessors to Seattle Car Manufacturing Company formed in 1905.

In
the United States, the Company's manufacturing operations are conducted through unincorporated divisions. Each of the divisions is responsible for at least one of the Company's
products. That responsibility includes new product development, applications engineering, manufacturing, marketing and selling.

Outside
the U.S., the Company manufactures and sells through wholly owned subsidiary companies in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, and Canada. An export sales
division generally is responsible for sales outside primary markets.

The
Netherlands subsidiary also has a manufacturing plant located in Belgium and uses foreign sales subsidiaries and importers to handle export sales in the European Union and Eastern
Europe.

Product
financing and leasing is offered through subsidiaries located in North America, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Product financing is offered through a 49%-owned joint
venture throughout most countries in the European Union.

Financial
Information About Industry Segments and Geographic Areas

Information
about the Company's industry segments and geographic areas in response to Items 101(b), (c)(1)(i), and (d) of Regulation S-K appears on pages 44
and 45 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2000 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(c)

Narrative
Description of Business

The
Company has two principal industry segments, (1) manufacture and distribution of light-, medium-and heavy-duty trucks and related aftermarket distribution of
parts and (2) finance and leasing services provided to customers and dealers. The Company distributes trucks and parts primarily through its independent dealer network. The Company's finance
and leasing activities are principally related to Company products and associated equipment. Other manufactured products include industrial winches.

TRUCKS

The Company and its subsidiaries design and manufacture trucks which are marketed under the Peterbilt, Kenworth, DAF and Foden nameplates in the
heavy-duty diesel category. These vehicles, which are built in five plants in the United States, four in Europe and one each in Australia and Mexico, are used worldwide for
over-the-road and off-highway hauling of freight, petroleum, wood products, construction and other materials. Commercial trucks and related service parts comprise
the largest segment of the Company's business, accounting for 93% of total 2000 revenues.

The
Company, through its Peterbilt and Kenworth Divisions, competes in the North American Class 6/7 markets primarily with conventional models. These medium-duty trucks
are assembled at the Company's new Ste. Therese, Quebec plant and at the Company's Mexican subsidiary in Mexicali, Mexico. This line of business represents a small, but increasing, percentage of the
Company's North American sales. The Company competes in the European medium commercial vehicle market with DAF and Foden cab-over-engine trucks manufactured in the Netherlands
and the United Kingdom. Leyland, another of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, manufactures light commercial vehicles in the United Kingdom for sale throughout Europe under the DAF nameplate.
During 2000, DAF continued its long-term design development under an agreement with Renault V.I. for a new light-line

product. The new product was introduced at the Brussels motor show in January 2001, with production scheduled to begin in April 2001.

Trucks
and related parts are sold to independent dealers for resale. Trucks manufactured in the U.S. for sale outside North America are marketed by PACCAR International, a U.S.
division. Those sales are made through a worldwide network of dealers. Trucks manufactured in Australia, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are marketed in their primary markets through
independent
dealers and a small number of factory branches. Trucks manufactured in these countries for export beyond their primary market area are marketed by DAF or PACCAR International.

The
Company's trucks are essentially custom products and have a reputation for high quality. For a majority of the Company's truck operations, major components, such as engines,
transmissions and axles, as well as a substantial percentage of other components, are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to PACCAR and customer specifications. DAF, which is more
vertically integrated, manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components.

Raw
materials and other components used in the manufacture of trucks are purchased from a number of suppliers. The Company is not limited to any single source for any significant
component. No significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2000. Manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers
accordingly.

Replacement
truck parts are sold and delivered to the Company's independent dealers through the Company's parts distribution network. Parts are both manufactured by the Company and
purchased from various suppliers. Replacement parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery.

There
were four other principal competitors in the U.S. Class 8 truck market in 2000. The Company's share of that market was approximately 21% of registrations in 2000. There
were seven other principal competitors in the European Class 4-8 commercial vehicle market in 2000, including parent companies to three competitors of the Company in the United
States. The Company's subsidiary, DAF, had approximately a 10% share of the western Europe heavy-duty Class 8 market and an 8% share of the Class 4-7 market.
These markets are highly competitive in price, quality and service, and PACCAR is not dependent on any single customer for its sales. There are no significant seasonal variations.

The
Peterbilt, Kenworth, DAF and Foden nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the Company's truck products. The Company engages in a
continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world.

Although
the Company's truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission controls, competing manufacturers are subject to the same controls. The Company believes the cost
of complying with noise and emission controls will not be detrimental to its business.

The
Company had a total production backlog of over $1 billion at the end of 2000. Within this backlog, orders scheduled for delivery within three months (90 days) are
considered to be firm. The 90-day backlog approximated $0.8 billion at December 31, 2000 compared with approximately $1.9 billion at year-end 1999.
Production of the year-end 2000 backlog is expected to be completed during 2001.

The
number of persons employed by the Company in its truck business at December 31, 2000 was approximately 16,600.

OTHER BUSINESS

The Truck and Other segment includes a division of the Company which manufacturers industrial winches in two U.S. plants and markets them under the Braden,
Carco, and Gearmatic nameplates. The markets for these products are highly competitive and the Company competes with a number of well established firms.

The Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products. The Company has an ongoing
program of trademark and trade name protection in all relevant marketing areas.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

In North America, Australia and the United Kingdom, the Company provides financing principally for its manufactured trucks through six wholly owned finance
companies. These companies provide inventory financing for independent dealers selling PACCAR products and retail and lease financing for new and used trucks and other transportation equipment sold
principally by its independent dealers. Customer contracts are secured by the products financed.

PACCAR
has a 49% equity ownership in DAF Financial Services in Europe. This investment, which is recorded under the equity method, is not material.

The
Company also conducts full service leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in North America under the PacLease trade name. Selected dealers in North America are
franchised to provide full service leasing. These franchisees are leased equipment and provided managerial support. The Company also operates full service lease outlets on its own behalf.

PATENTS

The Company owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines. Although these patents are considered important to the overall conduct of the Company's
business, no patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the Company's business.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company maintains technical centers dedicated to product testing and research and development activities. Additional product development activities are
conducted within each separate manufacturing division. Amounts spent on research and development approximated $102 million in 2000, $125 million in 1999 and $119 million in 1998.

REGULATION

As a manufacturer of highway trucks, the Company is subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Company believes it is in compliance with the Act and applicable safety standards.

Information
regarding the effects that compliance with international, federal, state and local provisions regulating the environment have on the Company's capital and operating
expenditures and the Company's involvement in environmental cleanup activities is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Items 7 and 8, respectively.

EMPLOYEES

On December 31, 2000, the Company employed a total of approximately 18,000 persons.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The Company and its subsidiaries own and operate manufacturing plants in five U.S. states, four locations in Europe, and one each in Australia, Canada and
Mexico. Several parts distribution centers, sales and service offices, and finance and administrative offices are also operated in owned or leased premises in these and other countries. DAF operates
sales subsidiaries in owned or leased premises in various countries throughout Europe. Facilities for product testing and research and development are located in Skagit County, Washington and
Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The Company's corporate headquarters is located in owned premises in Bellevue, Washington.

The
Company considers substantially all of the properties used by its businesses to be suitable for their intended purposes. The Company's Canadian plant, which was closed during
1996-1998, has been rebuilt. It reopened and began production in August 1999.

Geographical
locations of manufacturing plants within indicated industry segments are as follows:

U.S.
