PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

(a)
General Development of Business

PACCAR
Inc (the Company), incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1971, is the
successor to Pacific Car and Foundry Company which was incorporated in
Washington in 1924. The Company traces its predecessors to Seattle Car
Manufacturing Company formed in 1905.

(b)
Financial Information About Industry Segments and Geographic Areas

Information
about the Company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to
Items 101(b), (c)(1)(i), and (d) of Regulation S-K appears on page 49 of
the Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2006 and is
incorporated herein by reference.

(c)
Narrative Description of Business

The
Company has two principal industry segments, (1) design, manufacture and
distribution of light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks and related aftermarket
distribution of parts and (2) finance and leasing services provided to
customers and dealers. The Company’s finance and leasing activities are
principally related to Company products and associated equipment. Other
manufactured products include industrial winches.

TRUCKS

The
Company and its subsidiaries design and manufacture heavy-duty diesel trucks
which are marketed under the Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates. These
vehicles, which are built in four plants in the United States, three in Europe
and one each in Australia, Canada, and Mexico, are used worldwide for
over-the-road and off-highway hauling of freight, petroleum, wood products,
construction and other materials.

The Company, through its
Peterbilt and Kenworth Divisions, competes in the North American medium duty
(Class 6/7) markets primarily with conventional models. These medium-duty
trucks are assembled at the Company’s Ste. Therese, Quebec plant and at the
Company’s facility in Mexicali, Mexico. The Company competes in the European
light/medium (6 to 15 metric ton) commercial vehicle market with DAF
cab-over-engine trucks assembled in the United Kingdom by Leyland, one of
the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries.

Commercial
trucks and related replacement parts comprise the largest segment of the
Company’s business, accounting for 93% of total 2006 net sales and revenues.

Substantially
all trucks and related parts are sold to independent dealers. The Kenworth and
Peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the
U.S. and a foreign subsidiary in Canada. The Kenworth nameplate is also
marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in Mexico and Australia.
The DAF nameplate is marketed and distributed by a foreign subsidiary
headquartered in the Netherlands.  A
U.S. division, PACCAR International, also markets all three nameplates outside
each of their primary markets. The decision to operate as a subsidiary
or as a division is incidental to Truck Segment operations and reflects
legal, tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where PACCAR
operates.


The
Truck Segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing, information technology,
technical research and testing, treasury and finance functions. Certain
manufacturing plants in North America produce trucks for more than one
nameplate in common production facilities, while other plants produce trucks
for only one nameplate, depending on various factors. Also, as a result
of the close similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate, best
manufacturing practices within the Company are shared on a routine basis.

The
Company’s trucks are essentially custom products and have a reputation for high
quality. For a significant portion of the Company’s truck operations,
major components, such as engines, transmissions and axles, as well as a
substantial percentage of other components, are purchased from component
manufacturers pursuant to PACCAR and customer specifications. DAF, which
is more vertically integrated, manufactures its own engines and axles and
a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models. The
value of truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges
from approximately 45% in Europe to approximately 90% in North America.

Raw
materials and other components used in the manufacture of trucks are purchased
from a number of suppliers. The Company’s DAF subsidiary purchases fully
assembled cabs from a competitor, Renault V.I., for its European
light-duty product line pursuant to a joint product development and long-term
supply contract. Sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to
approximately 2% of consolidated revenues in 2006. A short-term loss of supply,
and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks, would
not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.
However, a loss of supply for an extended period of time would either require
the Company to contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture
cabs itself. Other than these components, the Company is not limited to any
single source for any significant component, although the sudden inability
of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect
on production of certain products. No significant shortages of materials
or components were experienced in 2006. Manufacturing inventory levels are
based upon production schedules and orders are placed with suppliers
accordingly.

Replacement
truck parts are sold and delivered to the Company’s independent dealers through
the Company’s parts distribution network. Parts are both manufactured by the
Company and purchased from various suppliers. Replacement parts inventory
levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need
for timely delivery. As a percentage of total consolidated net sales and
revenues, parts sales were 11.8% in 2006, 12.0% in 2005 and
11.8% in 2004.

There
were three other principal competitors in the U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck
market in 2006. The Company’s share of that market was 25.3% of retail sales in
2006.   In Europe there were five other
principal competitors in the commercial vehicle market in 2006, including
parent companies to two competitors of the Company in the United
States. In 2006, DAF had a 14.5% share of the Western European heavy-duty
market and a 9.6% share of the light/medium market. These markets are highly
competitive in price, quality and service, and PACCAR is not dependent on any
single customer for its sales. There are no significant seasonal variations in
sales.

The
Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates are recognized internationally and play
an important role in the marketing of the Company’s truck products. The Company
engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all
marketing areas of the world.

The
Company’s truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission
regulations and competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations.
The Company believes the cost of complying with noise and emission
regulations will not be detrimental to its business.


The
Company had a total production backlog of $3.5 billion at the end of 2006.
Within this backlog, orders scheduled for delivery within three months (90
days) are considered to be firm. The 90-day backlog approximated $2.7
billion at December 31, 2006, and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2005.
Production of the year-end 2006 backlog is expected to be substantially
completed during 2007.

OTHER BUSINESS

The
Truck and Other businesses include a division of the Company which manufactures
industrial winches in two U.S. plants and markets them under the Braden, Carco,
and Gearmatic nameplates. The markets for these products are highly competitive
and the Company competes with a number of well established firms. Sales of
industrial winches were less than 1% of net sales and revenues in 2006,
2005 and 2004.

The
Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized
internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

In North America, Australia and 13 European countries,
the Company provides financing and leasing arrangements, principally for
its manufactured trucks, through wholly owned finance companies operating under
the PACCAR Financial or PacLease trade names. They provide inventory financing
for independent dealers selling PACCAR products, and retail and lease financing
for new and used trucks and other transportation equipment sold principally by
its independent dealers. Receivables are secured by the products financed or
leased.

The Company also conducts full service leasing
operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in North America under the
PacLease trade name. Selected dealers in North America are franchised to
provide full service leasing. The Company provides its franchisees equipment
financing and managerial support. The Company also operates full service lease
outlets on its own behalf.

PATENTS

The Company owns numerous patents which relate to all
product lines. Although these patents are considered important to the overall
conduct of the Company’s business, no patent or group of patents is considered
essential to a material part of the Company’s business.

REGULATION

As a manufacturer of highway
trucks, the Company is subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration as well as environmental laws and
regulations in the United States, and is subject to similar regulations in
Canada, Mexico, Australia and Europe. In addition, the Company is subject
to certain other licensing requirements to do business in the United States and
Europe. The Company believes it is in compliance with laws and regulations
applicable to safety standards, the environment and other licensing
requirements in all countries where it has operations.

Information regarding the effects that compliance with
international, federal, state and local provisions regulating the environment
have on the Company’s capital and operating expenditures and the Company’s
involvement in environmental cleanup activities is included in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in
Items 7 and 8, respectively.


EMPLOYEES

On December 31, 2006, the Company
employed a total of approximately 21,000 persons.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

The following are significant risks which could
negatively impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Business
and Industry Risks

The commercial truck market demand is variable.

Demand for commercial vehicles depends
to some extent on economic and other conditions in a given market and the
introduction of new vehicles and technologies. 
Further, the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase
or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the
Company serves which are principally North America and Western
Europe.  Demand may also be affected by
factors impacting new truck prices such as costs of raw materials and
components and cost of compliance with governmental regulations (including
tariffs, engine emissions regulations, import regulation and taxes).

The financial services industry is highly
competitive.

The
Company competes with banks, other commercial finance companies and
financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing, higher
leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower
interest rates, which may lead to decreased margins, lower market share or
both. A decline in the Company’s commercial truck unit sales, an
increase in residual value risk due to lower used truck pricing and
increased funding costs are also factors which may negatively affect the
Company’s financial services operations.

The financial services segment is subject to
credit risk.

The
financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the
failure of a customer, dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans,
leases and derivative contracts with the Company.  Although the financial assets of the
financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral,
in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the Company, there
is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be
sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the Company resulting in
credit losses.

Political, Regulatory and Economic Risks

The Company’s operations could be subject to
currency and interest rate fluctuations.

The Company’s consolidated financial
statements, which are presented in U.S. dollars, are affected by foreign
currency exchange fluctuations through both translation and transaction
risk.  The Company uses certain
derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce,
but not eliminate, the effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations.

The Company may be adversely affected by political
instabilities, fuel shortages or interruptions in transportation systems,
natural calamities, wars, terrorism and labor strikes.

The
Company is subject to various risks associated with conducting business
worldwide.

premises in these and other countries. Facilities for product testing and
research and development are located in Washington state and the
Netherlands. The Company’s corporate headquarters is located in owned premises
in Bellevue, Washington. The Company considers all of the properties
used by its businesses to be suitable for their intended
