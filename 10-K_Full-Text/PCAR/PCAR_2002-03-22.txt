PART I

ITEM 1.          BUSINESS

(a)

General Development of Business

PACCAR

Inc (the Company), incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1971, is the

successor to Pacific Car and Foundry Company which was incorporated in

Washington in 1924. The Com­pany traces its predecessors to Seattle Car

Manufacturing Company formed in 1905.

In the

United States, the Company’s manufacturing operations are conducted through

unincor­porated divisions. Each of the divisions are responsible for at least

one of the Com­pany’s products. That responsibility includes new product

development, applications engineering, manufacturing, marketing and selling.

Outside

the U.S., the Company manufactures and sells through wholly-owned subsidiary

com­panies in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, and Canada.

An export sales division generally is responsible for sales outside primary

markets.

The

Netherlands subsidiary also has a manufacturing plant located in Belgium, and

uses foreign sales subsidiaries and importers to handle export sales to the

European Union and Eastern Europe.

Product

financing and leasing is offered through subsidiaries located in North America,

Australia,  United Kingdom, the

Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

(b)

Financial Information About Industry Segments and Geographic Areas

Information

about the Company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to Items

101(b), (c)(1)(i), and (d) of Regulation S-K appears on pages 44 and 45 of the

Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2001 and is

incorporated herein by reference.

(c)

Narrative Description of Business

The

Company has two principal industry segments, (1) manufacture and distribution

of light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks and related aftermarket distribution

of parts and (2) finance and leasing services provided to customers and

dealers. The Company distributes trucks and parts primarily through its

independent dealer network. The Company’s finance and leasing activities are principally

related to Company products and associated equipment. Other manufactured

products include in­dustrial winches.

TRUCKS

The

Company and its subsidiaries design and manufacture trucks which are marketed

under the Peterbilt, Kenworth, DAF and Foden nameplates in the heavy-duty

diesel category. These vehicles, which are built in four plants in the United

States, three in Europe and one each in Australia, Canada, and Mexico, are used

worldwide for over-the-road and off-highway hauling of freight, petroleum, wood

products, construction and other materials. Commercial trucks and related

replacement parts comprise the largest segment of the Company’s business,

accounting for  92% of total 2001 net

sales and revenues.


The Company, through its

Peterbilt and Kenworth Divisions, competes in the North American Class 6/7

markets primarily with conventional models. These medium-duty trucks are

assembled at the Company’s Ste. Therese, Quebec plant and at the Company’s

facility in Mexicali, Mexico. This line of business represents a small, but

increasing, percentage of the Company’s North American sales. The Company

competes in the European light/medium (6 to 15 metric ton) commercial vehicle

market with DAF cab-over-engine trucks assembled in the United Kingdom by

Leyland, one of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. During 2001, DAF

completed its development of an updated light-line product. The new product,

which began full-scale production in April 2001, was recently named 2002

International Truck of the Year in Europe.

Trucks

and related parts are sold to independent dealers for resale. Trucks

manufactured in the U.S. and Canada for sale outside North America are marketed

by PACCAR International, a U.S. division. Those sales are made through a

worldwide network of dealers. Trucks manufactured in Australia, Mexico, the

Netherlands and the United Kingdom are marketed in their primary markets

through independent dealers and a small number of factory branches. Trucks

manufactured in these countries for export to South America, Africa and Asia

are marketed by DAF or PACCAR International.

The

Company’s trucks are essentially custom products and have a reputation for high

quality. For a significant portion of the Company’s truck operations, major

components, such as engines, transmissions and axles, as well as a substantial

percentage of other components, are purchased from component manufacturers

pursuant to PACCAR and customer specifications. DAF, which is more vertically

integrated, manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of

other components for its heavy truck models.

Raw

materials and other components used in the manufacture of trucks are purchased

from a number of suppliers. The Company purchases fully assembled cabs from a

competitor for its European light/medium product line pursuant to a joint

product development and long-term supply contract. Other than these components,

the Company is not limited to any single source for any significant component.

No significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2001.

Manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders

are placed with suppliers accordingly.

Replacement

truck parts are sold and delivered to the Company’s independent dealers through

the Company’s parts distribution network. Parts are both manufactured by the

Company and pur­chased from various suppliers. Replacement parts inventory

levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for

timely delivery.

There were three other

principal competitors in the U.S. Class 8 truck market in 2001. The Company’s

share of that market was 19.5% of registrations in 2001. In Europe there were

five other principal competitors in the commercial vehicle market in 2001,

including parent companies to two competitors of the Company in the United

States. The Company’s subsidiary, DAF, had an 11.4% share of the Western

European heavy-duty market and a 7.7% share of the light/medium market. These

markets are highly competitive in price, quality and service, and PACCAR is not

dependent on any single customer for its sales. There are no significant

seasonal variations.

The Peterbilt, Kenworth, DAF

and Foden nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role

in the marketing of the Company’s truck products. The Company engages in a

continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing

areas of the world.


Although the Company’s truck

products are subject to environmental noise and emission con­trols, competing

manufacturers are subject to the same controls. The Company believes the cost

of complying with noise and emission controls will not be detrimental to its

business.

The Company had a total

production backlog of over $1 billion at the end of 2001. Within this backlog,

orders scheduled for delivery within three months (90 days) are considered to

be firm. The 90-day backlog approximated $0.8 billion at December 31, 2001 and

2000. Production of the year-end 2001 backlog is expected to be completed

during 2002.

The number of persons

employed by the Company in its truck business at December 31, 2001 was

approximately 14,700.

OTHER BUSINESS

The

Truck and Other segment includes a division of the Company which manufacturers

industrial winches in two U.S. plants and markets them under the Braden, Carco,

and Gearmatic nameplates. The markets for these products are highly competitive

and the Company competes with a number of well established firms.

The

Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized

internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products.

The Company has an ongoing program of trademark and trade name protection in

all relevant marketing areas.

FINANCIAL

SERVICES

In North America, Australia

and seven Western European countries, the Company provides financing and

leasing arrangements principally for its manufactured trucks through wholly-owned

finance companies. These companies provide inventory financing for independent

dealers selling PACCAR products and retail and lease financing for new and used

trucks and other transportation equipment sold principally by its independent

dealers. Customer contracts are secured by the products financed or leased.

PACCAR has a

49% equity ownership in DAF Financial Services (DFS) in Europe. Effective July

1, 2001, concurrent with the start-up of the wholly-owned PACCAR Financial

Europe in seven Western European markets, DFS ceased writing new business.  DFS will continue to service existing assets

until they are liquidated in the ordinary course of business.  This

investment, which is

recorded under the equity method, was $32 million at December 31, 2001.

The Company also conducts full service

leasing operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America under the

PacLease trade name. Selected dealers in North America are franchised to

provide full service leasing.  The

Company provides its franchisees equipment financing and managerial

support.  The Company also operates full

service lease outlets on its own behalf.

PATENTS

The Company owns numerous

patents which relate to all product lines. Although these patents are

considered important to the overall conduct of the Company’s business, no

patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the

Company’s business.


REGULATION

As a

manufacturer of highway trucks, the Company is subject to the National Traffic

and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards

promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Company

believes it is in compliance with the Act and applicable safety standards.

Information

regarding the effects that compliance with international, federal, state and

local provisions regulating the environment have on the Company’s capital and

operating expenditures and the Company’s involvement in environmental cleanup

activities is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial

Condition and Results of Operations and the Company’s Consolidated Financial

Statements incorporated by reference in Items 7 and 8, respectively.

EMPLOYEES

On December 31, 2001, the

Company employed a total of approximately 16,000 persons.


ITEM 2.          PROPERTIES

The Company and its

subsidiaries own and operate manufacturing plants in five U.S. states, three

locations in Europe, and one each in Australia, Canada and Mexico. Several

parts distribution centers, sales and service offices, and finance and

administrative

offices are also operated in owned or leased premises in these

and

other countries. DAF operates sales subsidiaries in owned or leased premises in

various

countries throughout Europe. Facilities for product testing and research and

development are located in Skagit County, Washington and Eindhoven, the

Netherlands. The Company’s corporate headquarters is located in owned premises

in Bellevue, Washington.

The Company considers

substantially all of the properties used by its businesses to be suitable for

their intended purposes. Most of the Company’s manufacturing facilities

operated near their productive capacities for most of 1999. However, due to a

significant downturn in the North Ameri­can heavy truck market beginning in

2000, capacity in North America has been substantially un­derutilized in 2001.

The

following summarizes the number of the Company’s manufacturing plants by

geographical location within indicated industry segments:

U.S.

Canada

Australia

Mexico

Europe

Trucks

Properties

located in Seattle, Washington, Torrance, California and Odessa, Texas are

obtained principally as a result of business acquisitions in 1987.

ITEM 3.          LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company and its

subsidiaries are parties to various lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course

of business. Management believes that the disposition of such lawsuits will not

materially affect the Company’s consolidated financial position.

ITEM 4.          SUBMISSION

OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to

a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2001.
