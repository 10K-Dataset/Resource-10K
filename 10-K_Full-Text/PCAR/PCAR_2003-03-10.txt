PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

(a) General Development of

Business

PACCAR Inc (the Company),

incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1971, is the successor to Pacific

Car and Foundry Company which was incorporated in Washington in 1924. The

Company traces its predecessors to Seattle Car Manufacturing Company formed in

1905.

(b) Financial Information About

Industry Segments and Geographic Areas

Information about the Company’s

industry segments and geographic areas in response to Items 101(b), (c)(1)(i),

and (d) of Regulation S-K appears on pages 46 and 47 of the Annual Report to

Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2002 and is incorporated herein by

reference.

(c) Narrative Description of

Business

The Company has two principal

industry segments, (1) manufacture and distribution of light-, medium- and

heavy-duty trucks and related aftermarket distribution of parts and (2) finance

and leasing services provided to customers and dealers. The Company distributes

trucks and parts primarily through its independent dealer network. The

Company’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to Company

products and associated equipment. Other manufactured products include

industrial winches.

TRUCKS

The Company and its subsidiaries

design and manufacture heavy-duty diesel trucks which are marketed under the

Peterbilt, Kenworth, DAF and Foden nameplates. These vehicles, which are built

in four plants in the United States, three in Europe and one each in Australia,

Canada, and Mexico, are used worldwide for over-the-road and off-highway

hauling of freight, petroleum, wood products, construction and other materials.

Commercial trucks and related replacement parts comprise the largest segment of

the Company’s business, accounting for 93% of total 2002 net sales and

revenues.

The Company, through its Peterbilt and

Kenworth Divisions, competes in the North American medium-duty (Class 6/7)

markets primarily with conventional models. These medium-duty trucks are

assembled at the Company’s Ste. Therese, Quebec plant and at the Company’s

facility in Mexicali, Mexico. This line of business represents a small, but

increasing, percentage of the Company’s North American sales. The Company

competes in the European light/medium (6 to 15 metric ton) commercial vehicle

market with DAF cab-over-engine trucks assembled in the United Kingdom by

Leyland, one of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Substantially all trucks and

related parts are sold to dealers, which are independent except for

a small number of factory branches. The Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates

are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the U.S. and a foreign

subsidiary in Canada. The Kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed

by foreign subsidiaries in Mexico and Australia. The DAF and Foden nameplates

are marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries headquartered in the

Netherlands and United Kingdom, respectively. A U.S. division, PACCAR

International, also markets all four nameplates outside each of their primary

markets. The decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental

to Truck Segment operations and reflects legal, tax and regulatory requirements

in the various countries where PACCAR operates.


The Truck Segment utilizes

centrally managed purchasing, information technology, engineering technical

research and testing, treasury and finance functions. Certain manufacturing

plants in North America and Europe produce trucks for more than one nameplate

in common production facilities, while other plants produce trucks for only one

nameplate, depending on various factors. Also, as a result of the close

similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate, best

manufacturing practices within the Company are shared on a routine basis.

The Company’s trucks are

essentially custom products and have a reputation for high quality. For a

significant portion of the Company’s truck operations, major components, such

as engines, transmissions and axles, as well as a substantial percentage of

other components, are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to PACCAR

and customer specifications. DAF, which is more vertically integrated,

manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other

components for its heavy truck models. The value of truck components

manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 50% in Europe

to approximately 80% in North America.

Raw materials and other

components used in the manufacture of trucks are purchased from a number

of suppliers. The Company’s DAF subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from

a competitor, Renault V.I., for its European light-duty product line pursuant

to a joint product development and long-term supply contract. Sales of trucks

manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 5% of consolidated

revenues. A short-term loss of supply, and the resulting interruption in the

production of these trucks, would not have a material effect on the Company’s

results of operations. However, a loss of supply for an extended period of

time would either require the Company to contract for an alternative source of

supply or for the Company to manufacture cabs itself. Other than these

components, the Company is not limited to any single source for any significant

component, although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components

could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products. No

significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2002.

Manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders

are placed with suppliers accordingly.

Replacement truck parts are sold

and delivered to the Company’s independent dealers through the Company’s parts

distribution network. Parts are both manufactured by the Company and purchased

from various suppliers. Replacement parts inventory levels are determined

largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery. As a

percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues, parts sales were 15%

in 2002, 16% in 2001 and 12% in 2000.

There were three other principal competitors

in the U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck market in 2002. The Company’s share of

that market was 23.6% of retail sales in 2002. In Europe there were five other

principal competitors in the commercial vehicle market in 2002, including

parent companies to two competitors of the Company in the United States. The

Company’s subsidiary, DAF, had a 12.0% share of the Western European heavy-duty

market and a 8.6% share of the light/medium market. These markets are highly

competitive in price, quality and service, and PACCAR is not dependent on any

single customer for its sales. There are no significant seasonal variations.

The Peterbilt, Kenworth, DAF and Foden

nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the

marketing of the Company’s truck products. The Company engages in a continuous

program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the

world.

Although the Company’s truck products are

subject to environmental noise and emission controls, competing manufacturers

are subject to the same controls. The Company believes the cost of complying

with noise and emission controls will not be detrimental to its business.


The Company had a total production backlog of

$1.4 billion at the end of 2002. Within this backlog, orders scheduled for

delivery within three months (90 days) are considered to be firm. The 90-day

backlog approximated $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002, and $0.8 billion at

December 31, 2001. Production of the year-end 2002 backlog is expected to be

completed during 2003.

The number of persons employed by the Company

in its truck business at December 31, 2002, was approximately 15,500.

OTHER BUSINESS

The Truck and Other businesses

includes a division of the Company which manufacturers industrial winches in

two U.S. plants and markets them under the Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic

nameplates. The markets for these products are highly competitive and the

Company competes with a number of well established firms. Sales of industrial

winches were less than 1% of net sales and revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000.

The Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic

trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important

role in the marketing of those products. The Company has an ongoing program of

trademark and trade name protection in all relevant marketing areas.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

In North America, Australia and seven Western

European countries, the Company provides financing and leasing arrangements

principally for its manufactured trucks through wholly-owned finance companies

operating under the PACCAR Financial or PacLease trade names. They provide

inventory financing for independent dealers selling PACCAR products, and retail

and lease financing for new and used trucks and other transportation equipment

sold principally by its independent dealers. Receivables are secured by the

products financed or leased.

PACCAR has a 49% equity ownership in DAF

Financial Services (DFS) in Europe. Effective July 1, 2001, concurrent with the

start-up of wholly-owned PACCAR Financial Europe in seven Western European

markets, DFS ceased writing new business. At December 31, 2002 DFS had total

assets of $425 million compared to $715 million at December 31, 2001. DFS will

continue to service existing assets until they are liquidated in the ordinary

course of business. This investment, which is recorded under the equity method,

was $37 million at December 31, 2002. For DFS, operating results were

insignificant for the three years ended December 31, 2002.

The Company also conducts full service

leasing operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America under the

PacLease trade name. Selected dealers in North America are franchised to

provide full service leasing. The Company provides its franchisees equipment

financing and managerial support. The Company also operates full service lease

outlets on its own behalf.

PATENTS

The Company owns numerous patents which

relate to all product lines. Although these patents are considered important to

the overall conduct of the Company’s business, no patent or group of patents is

considered essential to a material part of the Company’s business.

REGULATION

As a manufacturer of highway

trucks, the Company is subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety

Act and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the National

Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Company believes it is in compliance

with the Act and applicable safety standards.


Information regarding the effects that

compliance with international, federal, state and local provisions regulating

the environment have on the Company’s capital and operating expenditures and

the Company’s involvement in environmental cleanup activities is included in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by

reference in Items 7 and 8, respectively.

EMPLOYEES

On December 31, 2002, the Company employed a

total of approximately 16,500 persons.
