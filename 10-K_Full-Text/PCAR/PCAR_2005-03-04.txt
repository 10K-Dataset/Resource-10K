PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

(a) General Development of Business

PACCAR Inc (the Company), incorporated under
the laws of Delaware in 1971, is the successor to Pacific Car and Foundry
Company which was incorporated in Washington in 1924. The Company traces its
predecessors to Seattle Car Manufacturing Company formed in 1905.

(b) Financial Information About Industry
Segments and Geographic Areas

Information about the Company’s industry
segments and geographic areas in response to Items 101(b), (c)(1)(i), and (d)
of Regulation S-K appears on page 47 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for
the year ended December 31, 2004 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

The Company has two principal industry
segments, (1) design, manufacture and distribution of light-, medium- and
heavy-duty trucks and related aftermarket distribution of parts and (2) finance
and leasing services provided to customers and dealers. The Company’s finance
and leasing activities are principally related to Company products and
associated equipment. Other manufactured products include industrial winches.

TRUCKS

The Company and its subsidiaries design and
manufacture heavy-duty diesel trucks which are marketed under the Peterbilt,
Kenworth, DAF and Foden nameplates. These vehicles, which are built in four
plants in the United States, three in Europe and one each in Australia, Canada,
and Mexico, are used worldwide for over-the-road and off-highway hauling of
freight, petroleum, wood products, construction and other materials. Commercial
trucks and related replacement parts comprise the largest segment of the Company’s
business, accounting for 95% of total 2004 net sales and revenues.

The Company, through its Peterbilt and
Kenworth Divisions, competes in the North American medium duty (Class 6/7)
markets primarily with conventional models. These medium-duty trucks are
assembled at the Company’s Ste. Therese, Quebec plant and at the Company’s
facility in Mexicali, Mexico. The Company competes in the European light/medium
(6 to 15 metric ton) commercial vehicle market with DAF cab-over-engine trucks
assembled in the United Kingdom by Leyland, one of the Company’s wholly-owned
subsidiaries.

Substantially all trucks and related parts
are sold to dealers, which are independent except for a small number of
factory branches. The Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates are marketed and
distributed by separate divisions in the U.S. and a foreign subsidiary in
Canada. The Kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign
subsidiaries in Mexico and Australia. The DAF and Foden nameplates are marketed
and distributed by foreign subsidiaries headquartered in the Netherlands
and United Kingdom, respectively. A U.S. division, PACCAR International, also
markets all four nameplates outside each of their primary markets. The decision
to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to Truck Segment
operations and reflects legal, tax and regulatory requirements in the various
countries where PACCAR operates.


The Truck Segment utilizes centrally managed
purchasing, information technology, engineering, technical research and
testing, treasury and finance functions. Certain manufacturing plants in North
America and Europe produce trucks for more than one nameplate in common
production facilities, while other plants produce trucks for only one
nameplate, depending on various factors. Also, as a result of the close
similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate, best
manufacturing practices within the Company are shared on a routine basis.

The Company’s trucks are essentially custom
products and have a reputation for high quality. For a significant portion of
the Company’s truck operations, major components, such as engines,
transmissions and axles, as well as a substantial percentage of other
components, are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to PACCAR and
customer specifications. DAF, which is more vertically integrated, manufactures
its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its
heavy truck models. The value of truck components manufactured by independent suppliers
ranges from approximately 40% in Europe to approximately 85% in North America.

Raw materials and other components used in
the manufacture of trucks are purchased from a number of suppliers. The
Company’s DAF subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor,
Renault V.I., for its European light-duty product line pursuant to a joint
product development and long-term supply contract. Sales of trucks manufactured
with these cabs amounted to approximately 3% of consolidated revenues in 2004. A
short-term loss of supply, and the resulting interruption in the production of
these trucks, would not have a material effect on the Company’s results
of operations. However, a loss of supply for an extended period of time
would either require the Company to contract for an alternative source of
supply or for the Company to manufacture cabs itself. Other than these
components, the Company is not limited to any single source for any significant
component, although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components
could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products. No
significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in 2004.
Manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and orders
are placed with suppliers accordingly.

Replacement truck parts are sold and
delivered to the Company’s independent dealers through the Company’s parts
distribution network. Parts are both manufactured by the Company and purchased
from various suppliers. Replacement parts inventory levels are determined
largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery. As a
percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues, parts sales were 12%
in 2004 and 15% in 2003 and 2002.

There were three other principal competitors
in the U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck market in 2004. The Company’s share of
that market was 24.6% of retail sales in 2004. The Company’s share of the Class
6 and 7 truck market in 2004 was 9.7%. In Europe there were five other
principal competitors in the commercial vehicle market in 2004, including
parent companies to two competitors of the Company in the United States. The
Company’s subsidiary, DAF, had a 12.8% share of the Western European heavy-duty
market and a 8.9% share of the light/medium market. These markets are highly
competitive in price, quality and service, and PACCAR is not dependent on any
single customer for its sales. There are no significant seasonal variations.

The Peterbilt, Kenworth, DAF and Foden
nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the
marketing of the Company’s truck products. The Company engages in a continuous
program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the
world.

Although the Company’s truck products are
subject to environmental noise and emission controls, competing manufacturers
are subject to the same controls. The Company believes the cost of complying
with noise and emission controls will not be detrimental to its business.


The Company had a total production backlog of
$6.6 billion at the end of 2004. Within this backlog, orders scheduled for
delivery within three months (90 days) are considered to be firm. The 90-day
backlog approximated $2.6 billion at December 31, 2004, and $1.5 billion at
December 31, 2003. Production of the year-end 2004 backlog is expected to be
substantially completed during 2005.

The number of persons employed by the Company
in its truck business at December 31, 2004, was approximately 19,500.

OTHER BUSINESS

The Truck and Other businesses include a
division of the Company which manufactures industrial winches in two U.S.
plants and markets them under the Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic nameplates. The
markets for these products are highly competitive and the Company competes with
a number of well established firms. Sales of industrial winches were less than 1%
of net sales and revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

The Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic trademarks
and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the
marketing of those products.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

In North America, Australia and eleven
Western European countries, the Company provides financing and leasing
arrangements principally for its manufactured trucks through wholly-owned
finance companies operating under the PACCAR Financial or PacLease trade names.
They provide inventory financing for independent dealers selling PACCAR
products, and retail and lease financing for new and used trucks and other
transportation equipment sold principally by its independent dealers.
Receivables are secured by the products financed or leased.

The Company also conducts full service
leasing operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America under the
PacLease trade name. Selected dealers in North America are franchised to
provide full service leasing. The Company provides its franchisees equipment
financing and managerial support. The Company also operates full service lease
outlets on its own behalf.

PACCAR had a 49% equity ownership in DAF
Financial Services (DFS) in Europe. During 2004, the Company sold its interest
in DFS for $39.8 million which approximated net book value.

PATENTS

The Company owns numerous patents which
relate to all product lines. Although these patents are considered important to
the overall conduct of the Company’s business, no patent or group of patents is
considered essential to a material part of the Company’s business.

REGULATION

As a manufacturer of highway trucks, the
Company is subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration as well as environmental laws and regulations in
the United States, and is subject to similar regulations in Canada, Mexico,
Australia and Europe. In addition, the Company is subject to certain other
licensing requirements to do business in the United States and Europe. The
Company believes it is in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to
safety standards, the environment and other licensing requirements in all
countries where it has operations.


Information regarding the effects that
compliance with international, federal, state and local provisions regulating
the environment have on the Company’s capital and operating expenditures and
the Company’s involvement in environmental cleanup activities is included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by
reference in Items 7 and 8, respectively.

EMPLOYEES

On December 31, 2004, the Company employed a
total of approximately 20,500 persons.

8-K and any amendments to those reports can be found on the Company’s website

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

and other countries. Facilities for product testing and
research and development are located in Washington state and the Netherlands.
The Company’s corporate headquarters is located in owned premises in Bellevue,
