PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

(a) General Development of Business

PACCAR Inc (the Company), incorporated under
the laws of Delaware in 1971, is the successor to Pacific Car and Foundry
Company which was incorporated in Washington in 1924. The Company traces
its predecessors to Seattle Car Manufacturing Company formed in 1905.

(b) Financial Information About Industry
Segments and Geographic Areas

Information about the Company’s industry
segments and geographic areas in response to Items 101(b), (c)(1)(i), and (d) of
Regulation S-K appears on page 49 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for
the year ended December 31, 2008 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

The Company has two principal industry
segments, (1) design, manufacture and distribution of light-, medium- and
heavy-duty trucks and related aftermarket distribution of parts and (2) finance
and leasing services provided to customers and dealers. The Company’s finance
and leasing activities are principally related to Company products and
associated equipment. Other manufactured products include industrial winches.

TRUCKS

The Company and its subsidiaries design and
manufacture heavy-duty diesel trucks which are marketed under the
Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates. These trucks, which are built
in four plants in the United States, three in Europe and one each in
Australia, Canada and Mexico, are used world-wide for over-the-road and
off-highway hauling of freight, petroleum, wood products, construction and
other materials. The Company competes in the North American Class 5-7
markets primarily with conventional models. 
These trucks are assembled at facilities in Ste. Therese, Canada and in
Mexicali, Mexico, which are operated by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries
located in those countries. The Company competes in the European light/medium
(6 to 15 metric ton) market with DAF cab-over-engine trucks assembled in the
United Kingdom by Leyland, one of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries.
Commercial trucks and related replacement parts comprise the largest segment of
the Company’s business, accounting for 90% of total 2008 net sales and
revenues.

Substantially all trucks and related parts
are sold to independent dealers. The Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates are
marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the U.S. and a foreign
subsidiary in Canada. The Kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed
by foreign subsidiaries in Mexico and Australia. The DAF nameplate is marketed
and distributed by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the Netherlands. A
U.S. division, PACCAR International, also markets all three nameplates outside
each of their primary markets. The decision to operate as a subsidiary
or as a division is incidental to Truck Segment operations and reflects
legal, tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where PACCAR
operates.


The Truck Segment utilizes centrally managed
purchasing, information technology, technical research and testing, treasury
and finance functions. Certain manufacturing plants in North America produce
trucks for more than one nameplate in common production facilities, while other
plants produce trucks for only one nameplate, depending on various factors. As
a result of the close similarity of the business models employed by each
nameplate, best manufacturing practices within the Company are shared on a
routine basis.

The Company’s trucks are essentially custom
products and have a reputation for high quality. For a significant portion
of the Company’s truck operations, major components, such as engines,
transmissions and axles, as well as a substantial percentage of other
components, are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to PACCAR and
customer specifications. DAF, which is more vertically integrated,
manufactures its own engines and axles and a higher percentage of other
components for its heavy truck models. The value of truck components
manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 50% in
Europe to approximately 90% in North America.

Raw materials and other components used in
the manufacture of trucks are purchased from a number of suppliers. The
Company’s DAF subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor,
Renault V.I., for its European light-duty product line pursuant to a joint
product development and long-term supply contract. Sales of trucks manufactured
with these cabs amounted to approximately 5% of consolidated revenues in 2008.
A short-term loss of supply, and the resulting interruption in the production
of these trucks, would not have a material effect on the Company’s results
of operations. However, a loss of supply for an extended period of time
would either require the Company to contract for an alternative source of
supply or to manufacture cabs itself. Other than these components, the Company
is not limited to any single source for any significant component,
although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could
have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products.
No significant shortages of materials or components were experienced in
2008. Manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules and
orders are placed with suppliers accordingly.

Replacement truck parts are sold and
delivered to the Company’s independent dealers through the Company’s parts
distribution network. Parts are both manufactured by the Company and purchased
from various suppliers. Replacement parts inventory levels are determined
largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery.
As a percentage of total consolidated net sales and revenues, parts sales were
15.1% in 2008, 15.0% in 2007, and 11.8% in 2006.

There were
three other principal competitors in the U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck
market in 2008. The Company’s share of the U.S. and Canadian market was 26.0%
of retail sales in 2008.  In Europe
there were five other principal competitors in the commercial vehicle market in
2008, including parent companies to two competitors of the Company in the
United States. In 2008, DAF had a 14.1% share of the Western and Central
European heavy-duty market and a 9.3% share of the light/medium market. These
markets are highly competitive in price, quality and service, and PACCAR is not
dependent on any single customer for its sales. There are no significant
seasonal variations in sales.

The
Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates are recognized internationally and play
an important role in the marketing of the Company’s truck products. The Company
engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all
marketing areas of the world.


The Company’s
truck products are subject to environmental noise and emission regulations and
competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations. The Company
believes the cost of complying with noise and emission regulations will not be
detrimental to its business.

The Company
had a total production backlog of $2.5 billion at the end of 2008. Within this
backlog, orders scheduled for delivery within three months (90 days) are
considered to be firm. The 90-day backlog approximated $0.8 billion
at December 31, 2008, $2.2 billion at December 31, 2007 and $2.7
billion at December 31, 2006. Production of the year-end 2008 backlog
is expected to be substantially completed during 2009.

OTHER BUSINESS

The Truck and Other businesses include a
division of the Company which manufactures industrial winches in two U.S.
plants and markets them under the Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic nameplates. The
markets for these products are highly competitive and the Company competes with
a number of well established firms. Sales of industrial winches were
approximately 1% of net sales and revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

The Braden, Carco, and Gearmatic trademarks
and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in
the marketing of those products.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

In North
America, Australia and 16 European countries, the Company provides financing
and leasing arrangements, principally for its manufactured trucks, through
wholly owned finance companies operating under the PACCAR Financial trade name.
They provide inventory financing for independent dealers selling PACCAR
products, and retail and lease financing for new and used trucks and other
transportation equipment sold principally by its independent dealers.
Receivables are secured by the products financed or leased.

The Company also conducts full service
leasing operations through wholly owned subsidiaries in North America and
Germany under the PacLease trade name. Selected dealers in North America are
franchised to provide full service leasing. The Company provides its
franchisees equipment financing and administrative support. The Company also
operates full service lease outlets on its own behalf.

PATENTS

The Company
owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines. Although these patents
are considered important to the overall conduct of the Company’s business, no
patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the
Company’s business.

REGULATION

As a manufacturer of highway trucks, the
Company is subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration as well as environmental laws and regulations in
the United States, and is subject to similar regulations in Canada, Mexico,
Australia and Europe. In addition, the Company is subject to certain other
licensing requirements to do business in the United States and Europe. The
Company believes it is in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to
safety standards, the environment and other licensing requirements in all
countries where it has operations.


Information regarding the effects that
compliance with international, federal, state and local provisions regulating
the environment have on the Company’s capital and operating expenditures and
the Company’s involvement in environmental cleanup activities is included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by
reference in Items 7 and 8, respectively.

EMPLOYEES

On December 31,
2008, the Company had approximately 18,700 employees.

OTHER DISCLOSURES

The Company’s
filings on Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K and any amendments to those reports
can be found on the Company’s website www.paccar.com free of charge as soon as
practicable after the report is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The information on the Company’s website is
not incorporated by reference into this report.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

The following
are significant risks which could negatively impact the Company’s financial
condition or results of operations.

Business and Industry Risks

Commercial truck market demand is variable.

Demand for
commercial vehicles depends on economic and other conditions in a given market
and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies.  The yearly demand for commercial vehicles may
increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the
Company serves which are principally North America and Western Europe. Demand
may also be affected by factors impacting new truck prices such as costs of raw
materials and components and cost of compliance with governmental regulations
(including tariffs, engine emissions regulations, import regulations and taxes).

The financial services industry is highly competitive.

The Company
competes with banks, other commercial finance companies and financial
services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing, higher leverage or
market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates,
which may lead to decreased margins, lower market share or both. A decline
in the Company’s commercial truck unit sales, an increase in residual
value risk due to lower used truck pricing and increased funding costs are
also factors which may negatively affect the Company’s financial services
operations.

The financial services segment is subject to credit risk.

The
financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the
failure of a customer, dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans,
leases and derivative contracts with the Company. Although the financial assets
of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment
collateral, in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the Company,
there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be
sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the Company resulting in credit
losses.

T

he financial services segment
is subject to liquidity risk

.  The
global economy is experiencing a recession and the financial markets are
experiencing significant volatility.  Financial turmoil is affecting the
banking system and financial markets and has resulted in reduced liquidity in
the global credit markets.  Despite the reduced liquidity, the Company’s
financial services segment has generally been able to issue commercial paper,
medium-term notes and bank debt.  If commercial paper, medium-term notes
and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future, the
financial services segment may limit its financing of retail and wholesale
assets.  This may have a negative effect on the Company’s financial
services segment results.


Political, Regulatory and
Economic Risks

The Company’s operations could be subject to currency and interest rate
fluctuations.

The Company’s consolidated financial
statements, which are presented in U.S. dollars, are affected by foreign
currency exchange fluctuations through both translation and transaction
risk.  The Company uses certain
derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products
to reduce, but not eliminate, the effects of interest rate and foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The Company may be adversely affected by political instabilities, fuel
shortages or interruptions in transportation systems, natural calamities, wars,
terrorism and labor strikes.

The Company is subject to various risks associated
with conducting business worldwide.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

The Company
and its subsidiaries own and operate manufacturing plants in five U.S. states,
three countries in Europe, and one each in Australia, Canada and Mexico. The
Company also has a number of parts distribution centers, sales and service
offices, and finance and

administrative
offices which are operated in owned or leased premises in these

and other countries. Facilities for product testing and
research and development are located in Washington state and the
Netherlands. The Company’s corporate headquarters is located in owned premises
in Bellevue, Washington. The Company considers all of the properties
used by its businesses to be suitable for their intended
purposes.

The Company continuously
invests in facilities, equipment and processes to provide manufacturing and
warehouse capacity to meet its customers’ needs.

Construction of PACCAR’s new engine
production facility in Columbus, Mississippi began in July 2007 and is
expected to be completed in late 2010.  PACCAR’s 12.9-liter and 9.2-liter
diesel engines planned to be manufactured in Columbus will be installed in
Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks and may be exported to meet DAF’s production
requirements.  DAF’s engine production
facility in Eindhoven, the Netherlands may also manufacture the 12.9 liter and
9.2 liter engine for North America.

The following summarizes the number of the
Company’s manufacturing plants by geographical location within indicated
industry segments:

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Company
and its subsidiaries are parties to various lawsuits incidental to the ordinary
course of business. Management believes that the disposition of such lawsuits
will not materially affect the Company’s business or financial condition.
