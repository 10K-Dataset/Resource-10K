BUSINESS.

(a)

General Development of Business

PACCAR Inc (the Company or PACCAR), incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1971, is the successor to Pacific Car and Foundry Company which was incorporated in Washington in 1924. The Company traces its predecessors to Seattle Car Manufacturing Company formed in 1905.

(b)

Financial Information About Industry Segments and Geographic Areas

Information about the Company’s industry segments and geographic areas in response to Items 101(b), (c)(1)(i), and (d) of Regulation S-K appears in Item 8, Note S, of this Form 10-K.

(c)

Narrative Description of Business

PACCAR is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments:

(1)

The Truck segment includes the design, manufacture and distribution of high-quality, light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks. Heavy-duty trucks have a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of over 33,000 lbs (Class 8) in North America and over 16 metric tonnes in Europe. Medium-duty trucks have a GVW ranging from 19,500 to 33,000 lbs (Class 6 to 7) in North America, and in Europe, light- and medium-duty trucks range between 6 to 16 metric tonnes. Trucks are configured with engine in front of cab (conventional) or cab-over-engine (COE).

(2)

The Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles.

(3)

The Financial Services segment includes finance and leasing products and services provided to customers and dealers. PACCAR’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to PACCAR products and associated equipment.

PACCAR’s Other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches.

TRUCKS

PACCAR’s trucks are marketed under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates. These trucks, which are built in three plants in the United States, three in Europe and one each in Australia, Brasil, Canada and Mexico, are used worldwide for over-the-road and off-highway hauling of commercial and consumer goods. The Company also manufactures engines, primarily for use in the Company’s trucks, at its facilities in Columbus, Mississippi; Eindhoven, the Netherlands; and Ponta Grossa, Brasil. PACCAR competes in the North American Class 8 market, primarily with Kenworth and Peterbilt conventional models. These trucks are assembled at facilities in Chillicothe, Ohio; Denton, Texas; Renton, Washington; Ste. Therese, Canada and Mexicali, Mexico. PACCAR also competes in the North American Class 6 to 7 markets primarily with Kenworth and Peterbilt conventional models. These trucks are assembled at facilities in Ste. Therese, Canada and Mexicali, Mexico. PACCAR competes in the European light/medium market with DAF COE trucks assembled in the United Kingdom (U.K.) by Leyland, one of PACCAR’s wholly owned subsidiaries, and participates in the European heavy market with DAF COE trucks assembled in the Netherlands and the U.K. PACCAR competes in the Brazilian heavy truck market with DAF models assembled at Ponta Grossa in the state of Paraná, Brasil. PACCAR competes in the Australian medium and heavy truck markets with Kenworth conventional and certain DAF COE models assembled at its facility at Bayswater in the state of Victoria, Australia, and DAF COE models primarily assembled in the U.K. Commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of PACCAR’s business and accounted for 77% of total 2018 net sales and revenues.

Substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers. The Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the U.S. and a foreign subsidiary in Canada. The Kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in Mexico and Australia. The DAF nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the Netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in Brasil and Australia. The decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to PACCAR’s Truck segment operations and reflects legal, tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where PACCAR operates.

The Truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing, information technology, technical research and testing, treasury and finance functions. Some manufacturing plants in North America produce trucks for more than one nameplate, while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate, depending on various factors. Best manufacturing practices within the Company are shared on a routine basis reflecting the similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate.


The Company’s trucks have a reputation for h

igh quality products, most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specifications. Some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to b

e fitted with specialized bodies. For a significant portion of the Company’s truck operations, major components, such as engines, transmissions and axles, as well as a substantial percentage of other components, are purchased from component manufacturers p

ursuant to PACCAR and customer specifications. DAF, which is more vertically integrated, manufactures PACCAR engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models. The Company also manufactures engines at its Columbus, Mi

ssissippi facility. In 2018, the Company installed PACCAR engines in 41% of the Company’s Kenworth and Peterbilt heavy

‑duty trucks in the U.S. and Canada and substantially all of the DAF heavy-duty trucks sold throughout the world. Engines not manufactured

by the Company are purchased from Cummins Inc. (Cummins). The Company purchased a significant portion of its transmissions from Eaton Corporation Plc. (Eaton) and ZF Friedrichshafen AG (ZF). The Company also purchased a significant portion of North Americ

a stampings used for cabs from Magna International Inc. (Magna). The Company has long-term agreements with Cummins, Eaton, ZF and Magna to provide for continuity of supply. A loss of supply from Cummins, Eaton, ZF or Magna, and the resulting interruption i

n the production of trucks, would have a material effect on the Company’s results. Purchased materials and parts include raw materials, partially processed materials, such as castings, and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers. Raw mate

rials, partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 90% of the cost of new trucks. The value of major finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 30% in Europe to approximately 87

% in North America. In addition to materials, the Company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead, vehicle delivery and warranty. Accordingly, except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation, property taxes and utilities, the Com

pany’s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales.

The Company’s DAF subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor, Renault V.I., for its European light-duty product line pursuant to a joint product development and long-term supply contract. Sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3% of consolidated revenues in 2018. A short-term loss of supply, and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks, would not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. However, a loss of supply for an extended period of time would require the Company to either contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself.

Other than these components, the Company is not limited to any single source for any significant component, although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products. Manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules, and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly.

Key factors affecting Truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales. The Company’s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the Company’s share of those markets. Truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical based on the level of overall economic activity, the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported. The Company’s costs for trucks consist primarily of material costs, which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum and petroleum. The Company utilizes long-term supply agreements to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components. The Company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as changes to diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served. The Company maintains rigorous control of selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and seeks to minimize such costs.

There are four principal competitors in the U.S. and Canada commercial truck market. The Company’s share of the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 market was 29.4% of retail sales in 2018, and the Company’s medium-duty market share was 17.7%. In Europe, there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market, including parent companies to two competitors of the Company in the U.S. In 2018, DAF had a 16.6% share of the European heavy-duty market and a 9.0% share of the light/medium market. These markets are highly competitive in price, quality and service. PACCAR is not dependent on any single customer for its sales. There are no significant seasonal variations in sales.

The Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the Company’s truck products. The Company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world.

The Company’s truck products are subject to noise, emission and safety regulations. Competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations. The Company believes the cost of complying with these regulations will not be detrimental to its business.

The Company had a total production backlog of $14.7 billion at the end of 2018. Within this backlog, orders scheduled for delivery within three months (90 days) are considered to be firm. The 90‑day backlog approximated $4.5

billion at December 31, 2018, $4.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2016. Production of the year-end 2018 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2019.


PARTS

The Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles to over 2,200 Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers in 103 countries around the world. Aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the Company’s independent dealers through the Company’s 18 strategically located parts distribution centers (PDCs) in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Mexico and Central and South America. Parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the Company. Aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery. The Parts segment accounted for 16% of total 2018 net sales and revenues.

Key factors affecting Parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales. Aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the Company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks. To reflect the benefit the Parts segment receives from costs incurred by the Truck segment, certain factory overhead, research and development, engineering and SG&A expenses are allocated from the Truck segment to the Parts segment. The Company’s cost for parts sold consists primarily of material costs, which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum and petroleum. The Company utilizes long-term supply agreements to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold. The Company maintains rigorous control of SG&A expenses and seeks to minimize such costs.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

PACCAR Financial Services (PFS) operates in 24 countries in North America, Europe, Australia and South America through wholly owned finance companies operating under the PACCAR Financial trade name. PFS also conducts full service leasing operations through operating divisions or wholly owned subsidiaries in North America, Germany and Australia under the PacLease trade name. Selected dealers in North America are franchised to provide full service leasing. PFS provides its franchisees with equipment financing and administrative support. PFS also operates its own full service lease outlets. PFS’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small, medium and large commercial trucking companies, independent owner/operators and other businesses and acquire their PACCAR trucks principally from independent PACCAR dealers. PFS accounted for 6% of total net sales and revenues and 57% of total assets in 2018.

The Company’s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale, dealer retail and customer retail segments. The dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to independent PACCAR dealers. The dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises, which use the proceeds to fund their customers’ acquisition of trucks and related equipment. The customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for their acquisition of trucks and related equipment. Customer retail receivables are further segregated by fleet and owner/operator classes. The fleet class consists of customers operating more than five trucks. All others are considered owner/operators. Similar methods are employed to assess and monitor credit risk for each class.

Finance receivables are secured by the trucks and related equipment being financed or leased. The terms of loan and lease contracts generally range from three to five years depending on the type and use of equipment. Payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan, whichever comes first. Dealer inventory loans generally mature within one year.

The Company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in public and private offerings and, to a lesser extent, bank loans. An additional source of funds is loans from other PACCAR companies. PFS matches the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases.

Key factors affecting the earnings of the Financial Services segment include the volume of new loans and leases, the yield earned on the loans and leases, the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to PFS. New loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the Financial Services segment. The Company’s Financial Services market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market. PFS’s primary competitors include commercial banks and independent finance and leasing companies.

The revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of PFS to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service. Dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market. Retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term. PFS obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings, a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interest-rate contracts. This enables PFS to obtain a stable spread between the


cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term. Included in Financial Services cost of revenues is de

preciation on equipment on operating leases. The amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the acquisition cost of leased equipment, the term of the leases, which generally ranges from three to five years, and the residual value of

the leases, which generally ranges from 30% to 70%. The margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation, including interest and depreciation.

PFS incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts. PFS takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses.

The ability of customers to pay their obligations to PFS depends on the state of the general economy, the extent of freight demand, freight rates and the cost of fuel, among other factors. PFS limits its exposure to any one customer, with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5% of the aggregate portfolio assets. PFS generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck collateral and may require other collateral or guarantees. In the event of default, PFS will repossess the truck and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network as well as PFS used truck centers. PFS will also seek to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral. The amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and, in the event of repossession, the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices. PFS’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession. Used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness. As a result, credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness. PFS provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio, considering the amount of past due accounts, the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets.

Financial Services SG&A expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the loan and lease portfolios. These costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity, but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities, tend to be relatively stable.

OTHER BUSINESSES

Other businesses include the manufacturing of industrial winches in two U.S. plants and marketing them under the Braden, Carco and Gearmatic nameplates. The markets for these products are highly competitive, and the Company competes with a number of well established firms. Sales of industrial winches were less than 1% of total net sales and revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

The Braden, Carco and Gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products.

PATENTS

The Company owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines. Although these patents are considered important to the overall conduct of the Company’s business, no patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the Company’s business.

REGULATION

As a manufacturer of highway trucks, the Company is subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as well as environmental laws and regulations in the United States, and is subject to similar regulations in all countries where it has operations and where its trucks are distributed. In addition, the Company is subject to certain other licensing requirements to do business in the United States and Europe. The Company believes it is in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to safety standards, the environment and other licensing requirements in all countries where it has operations and where its trucks are distributed.

Information regarding the effects that compliance with international, federal, state and local provisions regulating the environment have on the Company’s capital and operating expenditures and the Company’s involvement in environmental cleanup activities is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Items 7 and 8, respectively.

EMPLOYEES

On December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 28,000 employees.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

The following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Business and Industry Risks

Commercial Truck Market Demand is Variable

. The Company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the Company’s equipment and services. The yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the Company serves, which are principally North America and Europe. Demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the Company or its competitors.

Competition and Prices.

The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect the Company’s sales and pricing.

Financial results depend largely on the ability to develop, manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand.

Production Costs and Supplier Capacity.

The Company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the Company’s financial results or use of its production capacity.

Many of the Company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers, and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the Company. Supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity.

Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase the Company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the Company’s or its suppliers’ operations.

Liquidity Risks, Credit Ratings and Costs of Funds.

Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the Company’s sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of customers, dealers and suppliers. A lowering of the Company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets.

The Company’s Financial Services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt. If the markets for commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future, the Financial Services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets. This could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the Company is able to produce and sell to customers.

The Financial Services Industry is Highly Competitive.

The Company’s Financial Services segment competes with banks, other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing, higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates, which may lead to decreased margins, lower market share or both. A decline in the Company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the Company’s Financial Services segment.

The Financial Services Segment is Subject to Credit Risk.

The Financial Services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer, dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans, leases and derivative contracts with the Company. Although the financial assets of the Financial Services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral, in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the Company, there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the Company, resulting in credit losses.

Interest-Rate Risks.

The

Financial Services segment

is subject to interest-rate risks, because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products, increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins.

PFS uses derivative contracts to match the interest rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of

changing interest rates.


Information Technology.

The Company relies on information technology systems a

nd networks to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of its business processes and activities. These computer systems and networks may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing s

oftware, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; computer viruses; or outside parties attempting to disrupt the Company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the Company’s electronic data. The Company maintains and continues to inves

t in protections to guard against such events. Examples of these protections include conducting third-party penetration tests, implementing software detection and prevention tools, event monitoring, and disaster recoverability. Additionally the Company mai

ntains a cybersecurity insurance policy. Despite these safeguards, there remains a risk of system disruptions, unauthorized access and data loss.

If the Company’s computer systems were to be damaged, disrupted or breached, it could impact data availability and integrity, result in a theft of the Company’s intellectual property or lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of the Company’s customers, suppliers and employees. Security breaches could also result in a violation of U.S. and international privacy and other laws and subject the Company to various litigations and governmental proceedings. These events could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, damage its reputation, disrupt operations and negatively impact competitiveness in the marketplace.

Political, Regulatory and Economic Risks

Multinational Operations

. The Company’s global operations are exposed to political, economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the Company operates.

The Company may be adversely affected by political instabilities, fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems, natural calamities, wars, terrorism and labor strikes.

Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and i

nternational trade policies may impact demand for the Company’s products, financial results and competitive position.

PACCAR’s global operations are subject to extensive trade, competition and anti-corruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs.

U.K. Exit from the European Union

. In March 2017, the United Kingdom (U.K.) invoked Article 50 of their treaty with the European Union signaling their intent to leave the EU. Under the EU Treaty the U.K. had two years to negotiate terms of their exit with the EU. Although a preliminary agreement between the EU and the U.K. Government was made, it was not ratified by the U.K. Parliament. If the terms of the exit from the EU are not agreed by March 29, 2019, it is anticipated that the standard trade protocols of the World Trade Organization (WTO) would become effective (“Hard Brexit”).

The Company manufactures medium- and heavy-duty DAF trucks in the U.K. which are sold primarily in the U.K. and to a lesser extent in Europe and other world markets. In 2018, approximately 10% of the Company’s worldwide truck production was manufactured in the U.K. Most of the truck components used in the manufacturing of trucks in the U.K., as well as aftermarket parts are sourced from the EU. In the event of a Hard Brexit, it is anticipated that there would be an increase in tariffs from truck components and parts from the EU which would increase the cost of all trucks and parts in the U.K. It is expected that there would also be an increase in tariffs on trucks sold from the U.K. to the EU which would lead to higher costs for trucks imported from the U.K into the EU. The imposition of tariffs and border controls would most likely lead to longer lead times in the supply chain from the EU and the U.K. In the event of a Hard Brexit, the Company anticipates that after a period of time, changes would be made to the supply chain to minimize the effects of tariffs and delays. The higher cost of trucks and parts may impact manufacturing and parts sales and margins which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Environmental Regulations.

The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations

that impose significant compliance costs.

The Company could experience higher research and development and manufacturing costs due to changes in government requirements for its products, including changes in emissions, fuel, greenhouse gas or other regulations.

Litigation, Product Liability and Regulatory.

The Company’s products are subject to recall for environmental, performance and safety-related issues. Product recalls, lawsuits, regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the Company establishes for contingencies may increase the Company’s costs and lower profits. Due to the international nature of the Company’s business, some products are also subject to international trade regulations, including customs and import / export related laws and regulations, government embargoes and sanctions prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries, as well as anti-corruption laws. The Company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets, and claims or regulatory actions, even if unsuccessful or without merit, could adversely affect the Company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity.

Currency Exchange and Translation.

The Company’s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries.

Currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the Company’s assets, liabilities and results of operations

through both translation and transaction risk

, as reported in the Company’s financial statements.

The Company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce, but not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.


Accounting Estimates.

In the preparation of the Company’s financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions th

at affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. Certain of these estimates, judgments and assumptions, such as residual values on operating leases, the allowance for credit losses and produc

t warranty are particularly sensitive. If actual results are different from estimates used by management, they may have a material impact on the financial statements. For additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates, see “Critical Accounting Polic

ies” under Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

Taxes.

Changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the Company operates impact the Company’s effective tax rate. Changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the Company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

None.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

The Company and its subsidiaries own and operate manufacturing plants in five U.S. states, three countries in Europe, and in Australia, Brasil, Canada and Mexico. The Company also has 18 parts distribution centers, many sales and service offices, and finance and administrative offices which are operated in owned or leased premises in these and other locations. Facilities for product testing and research and development are located in the state of Washington and the Netherlands. The Company also has an innovation center in Sunnyvale, California. The Company's corporate headquarters is located in owned premises in Bellevue, Washington. The Company considers all of the properties used by its businesses to be suitable for their intended purposes.

The Company invests in facilities, equipment and processes to provide manufacturing and warehouse capacity to meet its customers’ needs and improve operating performance.

The following summarizes the number of the Company’s manufacturing plants and parts distribution centers by geographical location within indicated industry segments:

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

On July 19, 2016, the European Commission (EC) concluded its investigation of all major European truck manufacturers and reached a settlement with DAF. Following the settlement, claims and lawsuits have been filed against the Company, DAF and certain DAF subsidiaries and other truck manufacturers. Others may bring EC-related claims and lawsuits against the Company or its subsidiaries. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses, such claims and lawsuits will likely take a significant period of time to resolve. An adverse outcome of such proceedings could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various other lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the disposition of such lawsuits will not materially affect the Company's business or financial condition.

•

Research and development (R&D) expenses were $306.1 million in 2018 compared to $264.7 million in 2017.

Peterbilt launched its new Model 579 UltraLoft in the first quarter of 2018, which offers customers a high-roof, integrated cab and sleeper that enhances driver comfort and operational efficiency. The UltraLoft dimensions represent an 18% increase in interior space giving drivers best-in-class living quarters. The Model 579 UltraLoft is an excellent tractor for long-haul routes, team driving and driver training.

Kenworth introduced the W990 in the third quarter of 2018. This new conventional truck is designed to maximize performance in many customer applications including over-the-road and vocational. The Kenworth model W990 features the PACCAR MX-13 engine rated up to 510-hp and 1,850 lb-ft of torque, the 12-speed PACCAR automated transmission, PACCAR tandem rear axles, and the Kenworth TruckTech+ connected truck system.

DAF highlighted its leadership in fuel efficiency and advanced powertrain technology by displaying a full range of innovative vehicles at the IAA truck show in Hannover, Germany. DAF showcased its CF Electric and LF Electric heavy- and medium-duty urban distribution vehicles. DAF also presented its CF Hybrid vehicle with the PACCAR MX-11 engine that delivers zero emissions in urban areas.

PACCAR Parts continues to add global parts distribution capacity to deliver industry-leading availability and to support the growth of PACCAR MX engine parts sales and the global fleet service program. A new 160,000 square-foot distribution center in Toronto, Ontario, Canada opened in October 2018.


PACCAR has been honored as a global leader in environmental practices by environmen

tal reporting firm CDP, earning recognition on the 2018

CDP Climate Change A List

. Every year, over 6,000 companies disclose data about their environmental impacts, risks and opportunities to CDP for independent assessment. Reporting companies receive scor

es of A to D- rating their effectiveness in tackling climate change and other environmental issues. PACCAR earned a CDP score of “A”, which places PACCAR in the top 2% of reporting companies.

In January 2019, PACCAR displayed innovative electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks at the CES 2019 show in Las Vegas, Nevada. CES is one of the world’s largest showcases for technological innovation. PACCAR exhibited three zero emission vehicles: a battery-electric Peterbilt Model 579EV; a battery-electric Peterbilt Model 220EV; and a hydrogen fuel cell electric Kenworth T680 developed in collaboration with Toyota. These trucks are designed for a range of customer applications, including over-the-road transportation, port operations and urban distribution. PACCAR was the only commercial vehicle manufacturer displaying trucks at CES.

Truck Outlook

Truck industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada in 2019 are expected to increase to 285,000 to 315,000 units compared to 284,800 in 2018. In Europe, the 2019 truck industry registrations for over 16-tonne vehicles are expected to be 290,000 to 320,000 units compared to 318,800 in 2018. In South America, heavy-duty truck industry sales in 2019 are estimated to increase to 100,000 to 110,000 units compared to 88,500 units in 2018.

Parts Outlook

In 2019, PACCAR Parts sales are expected to grow 5-8% compared to 2018 sales.

Financial Services Outlook

Based on the truck market outlook, average earning assets in 2019 are expected to increase 3-5% compared to 2018. Current high levels of freight tonnage, freight rates and fleet utilization are contributing to customers’ profitability and cash flow. If current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels and new business volume would likely decline.

Capital Spending and R&D Outlook

Capital investments in 2019 are expected to be $525 to $575 million, and R&D is expected to be $320 to $350 million. The Company is investing for long-term growth in new truck models, integrated powertrains including zero emission electrification and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, enhanced aerodynamic truck designs, advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity, and expanded manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.

See the Forward-Looking Statements section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis for factors that may affect these outlooks.

The following provides an analysis of the results of operations for the Company’s three reportable segments - Truck, Parts and Financial Services. Where possible, the Company has quantified the impact of factors identified in the following discussion and analysis. In cases where it is not possible to quantify the impact of factors, the Company lists them in estimated order of importance. Factors for which the Company is unable to specifically quantify the impact include market demand, fuel prices, freight tonnage and economic conditions affecting the Company’s results of operations.

2018 Compared to 2017:

Truck

The Company’s Truck segment accounted for 77% of revenues in 2018 compared to 76% in 2017.

The Company’s new truck deliveries are summarized below:

In 2018, industry retail sales in the heavy-duty market in the U.S. and Canada increased to 284,800 units from 218,400 units in 2017. The Company’s heavy-duty truck retail market share was 29.4% in 2018 compared to 30.7% in 2017. The medium-duty market was 98,000 units in 2018 compared to 81,900 units in 2017. The Company’s medium-duty market share was 17.7% in 2018 compared to 17.1% in 2017.


The over 16

‑tonne truck market in Europe in 2018 increased to 318,800

units from 306,100 units in 2017, and DAF’s market share was 16.6% in 2018 compared to 15.3% in 2017. The 6 to 16

‑tonne market in 2018 decreased to 51,900 units from 52,600 units in 2017. DAF’s market share in the 6 to 16-tonne market in 2018 was 9.0% com

pared to 10.5% in 2017.

The Company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues are summarized below:

The Company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues increased to $18.19 billion in 2018 from $14.77 billion in 2017, primarily reflecting higher truck deliveries in all of the Company’s primary markets. Truck segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues increased in 2018, reflecting the higher truck unit deliveries and higher gross margins.

The major factors for the changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2018 and 2017 for the Truck segment are as follows:

•

Truck sales volume primarily reflects higher truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada ($2,305.0 million sales and $1,890.7 million cost of sales) and Europe ($394.5 million sales and $333.0 million cost of sales).

•

Average truck sales prices increased sales by $377.0 million, primarily due to higher price realization in North America and Europe.

•

Average cost per truck increased cost of sales by $303.0 million, primarily reflecting higher material costs.

•

Factory overhead and other indirect costs increased $109.7 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses ($57.9 million) and higher supplies and maintenance costs ($47.5 million) to support increased truck production.

•

Extended warranties, operating leases and other decreased revenues by $72.9 million and cost of sales by $76.5 million, primarily due to lower revenues and costs from operating leases. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues and costs from service contracts.

•

The currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.

•

Truck gross margins increased to 11.8% in 2018 from 11.3% in 2017, primarily due to the factors noted above.


Truck selling, gener

al and administrative expenses (SG&A) for 2018 increased to $248.3 million from $216.0 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees ($20.1 million) and higher salaries and related expenses ($10.6 million). As a percentage of

sales, Truck SG&A decreased to 1.4% in 2018 from 1.5% in 2017 due to higher net sales.

Parts

The Company’s Parts segment accounted for 16% of revenues in 2018 compared to 17% in 2017.

The Company’s worldwide parts net sales and revenues increased to a record $3.84 billion in 2018 from $3.33 billion in 2017, due to higher aftermarket demand and successful marketing programs in all markets. The increase in Parts segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues in 2018 was primarily due to higher sales volume.

The major factors for the changes in net sales, cost of sales and gross margin between 2018 and 2017 for the Parts segment are as follows:

•

Aftermarket parts sales volume increased by $369.8 million and related cost of sales increased by $224.7 million due to higher demand in all markets.

•

Average aftermarket parts sales prices increased sales by $107.5 million, primarily due to higher price realization in the U.S. and Canada and Europe.

•

Average aftermarket parts direct costs increased $83.2 million due to higher material costs.

•

Warehouse and other indirect costs increased $18.4 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and higher maintenance costs.

•

The currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.

•

Parts gross margins in 2018 increased to 27.2% from 26.5% in 2017 due to the factors noted above.

Parts SG&A expense for 2018 was $206.2 million compared to $197.6 million in 2017 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and the effects of currency translation, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs. As a percentage of sales, Parts SG&A was 5.4% in 2018, down from 5.9% in 2017, due to higher net sales.


Financial Services

The Company’s Financial Services segment accounted for 6% of revenues in 2018 compared to 7% in 2017.

New loan and lease volume was a record $5.23 billion in 2018 compared to $4.33 billion in 2017, primarily due to higher truck deliveries in 2018. PFS finance market share of new PACCAR truck sales was 23.9% in 2018 compared to 24.9% in 2017.

PFS revenues increased to $1.36 billion in 2018 from $1.27 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to revenue on higher average earning assets and higher portfolio yields reflecting higher market interest rates in North America. The effects of currency translation increased PFS revenues by $10.9 million in 2018.

PFS income before income taxes increased to $305.9 million in 2018 from $261.7 million in 2017, primarily due to higher average earning asset balances and higher results on returned lease assets.


Included in Financial Services “Other Assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of $226.4 million at December 31, 2018 and $221.7 million at December 31, 2017. These trucks

are primarily units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also include trucks acquired from repossessions or through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales.

The Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $35.4 million in 2018 compared to $45.1 million in 2017, including losses on multiple unit transactions of $20.2

million in 2018 compared to $29.2 million in 2017. Used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were $.9

million and $5.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The major factors for the changes in interest and fees, interest and other borrowing expenses and finance margin between 2018 and 2017 are outlined below:

•

Average finance receivables increased $845.3 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2018 as a result of retail portfolio new business volume exceeding collections and higher dealer wholesale balances.

•

Average debt balances increased $666.7

million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2018. The higher average debt balances reflect funding for a higher average earning assets portfolio, which includes loans, finance leases, wholesale and equipment on operating lease.

•

Higher portfolio yields (5.0% in 2018 compared to 4.8% in 2017) increased interest and fees by $21.0 million. The higher portfolio yields were primarily due to higher market rates in North America.

•

Higher borrowing rates (2.0% in 2018 compared to 1.7% in 2017) were primarily due to higher debt market rates in North America.

The following table summarizes operating lease, rental and other revenues and depreciation and other expenses:


The major factors

for the changes in operating lease, rental and other revenues, depreciation and other expenses and lease margin between 2018 and 2017 are outlined below:

•

A lower sales volume of used trucks received on trade decreased operating lease, rental and other revenues by $20.5 million and decreased depreciation and other expenses by $21.9 million.

•

Results on returned lease assets decreased depreciation and other expenses by $11.5 million, primarily due to lower losses on sales of returned lease units.

•

Average operating lease assets increased $49.4 million (excluding foreign exchange effects), which increased revenues by $15.7 million and related depreciation and other expenses by $12.6 million.

•

Revenue per asset increased $16.0 million primarily due to higher rental utilization. Cost per asset increased $12.0 million due to higher depreciation expense and vehicle operating expenses.

•

The currency translation effects reflect an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, partially offset by the Mexican peso.

The following table summarizes the provision for losses on receivables and net charge-offs:

The provision for losses on receivables was $16.5 million in 2018 compared to $22.3

million in 2017, reflecting continued good portfolio performance. The lower provision for losses on receivables in Europe primarily reflects higher recoveries on charged-off accounts.

The Company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. When the Company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR).


The post-modification balance of accounts modified during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized below:

*

Recorded investment immediately after modification as a percentage of the year-end retail portfolio balance.

In 2018, total modification activity decreased compared to 2017, reflecting lower modifications for insignificant delays, credit – no concession and credit - TDRs, partially offset by higher commercial modifications. The increase in modifications for commercial reasons primarily reflects higher volumes of refinancing. The decrease in modifications for insignificant delay reflects fewer fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. The decrease in modifications for credit - no concession is primarily due to lower volumes of refinancing for customers in financial difficulty. Credit - TDR modifications

decreased to $13.1 million in 2018 from $20.5 million in 2017 mainly due to the contract modifications for two fleet customers in 2017.

The following table summarizes the Company’s 30+ days past due accounts:

Accounts 30+ days past due were .4% at December 31, 2018 and .5% at December 31, 2017. Lower past dues in the U.S. and Canada were partially offset by higher past dues in Europe and Mexico. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.

When the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified $7.2 million and $.6 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, which were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:

Modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The Company’s 2018 and 2017 annualized pre-tax return on average assets for Financial Services was 2.2% and 2.1%, respectively.


Other

Other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment. Other also includes non-service cost components of pension (income) expense and a portion of corporate expense. Other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2018 and 2017. Other SG&A was $70.4 million in 2018 and $50.4 million in 2017. The increase in Other SG&A was primarily due to higher compensation costs.

Other income

before tax decreased to $2.7 million in 2018 from $12.5 million in 2017 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses, partially offset by improved results in the winch business.

Investment income increased to $60.9 million in 2018 from $35.3 million in 2017, primarily due to higher average portfolio balances and higher yields on U.S. investments due to higher market interest rates.

Income Taxes

In 2018, the effective tax rate was 21.9% compared to 22.9% in 2017, reflecting the reduced federal tax rate of 21% enacted on December 22, 2017. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 was impacted by a one-time reduction in tax liability related to extended warranty contracts and higher realized R&D tax credits.

In 2018, the improvement in domestic and foreign income before taxes was primarily due to higher revenues and margins from truck and parts operations. Domestic and foreign pre-tax return on revenues increased primarily due to the improved truck and parts results.

2017 Compared to 2016:

Truck

The Company’s Truck segment accounted for 76% of revenues in 2017 compared to 75% in 2016.

The Company’s new truck deliveries are summarized below:

In 2017, industry retail sales in the heavy-duty market in the U.S. and Canada increased to 218,400 units from 215,700 units in 2016. The Company’s heavy-duty truck retail market share increased to 30.7% in 2017 from 28.5% in 2016. The medium-duty market was 81,900 units in 2017 compared to 85,500 units in 2016. The Company’s medium-duty market share was 17.1% in 2017 compared to 16.2% in 2016.

The over 16‑tonne truck market in Europe in 2017 increased to 306,100 units from 302,500 units in 2016, and DAF’s market share decreased to 15.3% in 2017 from 15.5% in 2016. The 6 to 16‑tonne market in 2017 decreased to 52,600 units from 52,900 units in 2016. DAF market share in the 6 to 16-tonne market in 2017 increased to 10.5% from 10.1% in 2016.


The Company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues are summarized below:

The Company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues increased to $14.77 billion in 2017 from $12.77 billion in 2016, primarily reflecting higher truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Australia. Truck segment income before income taxes in 2017 reflects higher truck deliveries, while pre-tax return on revenues decreased at the higher volumes due to a lower gross margin percentage.

The major factors for the changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2017 and 2016 for the Truck segment are as follows:

•

Truck delivery volume, which resulted in higher sales and cost of sales, primarily reflects higher truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada ($1,309.0 million sales and $1,104.3 million cost of sales) and Europe ($370.4 million sales and $312.2 million cost of sales).

•

Average truck sales prices increased sales by $121.6 million, primarily due to higher price realization in Europe ($66.7 million) and the U.S. and Canada ($66.2 million), partially offset by lower price realization in Mexico ($12.5 million).

•

Average cost per truck increased cost of sales by $102.7 million, reflecting higher material costs.

•

Factory overhead and other indirect costs increased $97.8 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses ($55.1 million), higher maintenance costs ($27.8 million) as well as higher depreciation expense ($12.7 million).

•

Operating lease revenues decreased by $28.1 million and cost of sales decreased by $25.2 million, reflecting higher revenues deferred and lower revenues recognized.

•

The currency translation effect on sales primarily reflects an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a weaker British pound. The currency effect on cost of sales primarily reflects the stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar.

•

Truck gross margins decreased to 11.3% in 2017 from 11.7% in 2016 primarily due to the factors noted above.

Truck selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for 2017 increased to $216.0 million from $205.7 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees and salaries and related expenses, partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenses. As a percentage of sales, Truck SG&A decreased to 1.5% in 2017 from 1.6% in 2016 due to higher net sales.


Parts

The Company’s Parts segment accounted for 17% of revenues in 2017 compared to 18% in 2016.

The Company’s worldwide parts net sales and revenues increased to a record $3.33 billion in 2017 from $3.01 billion in 2016, due to higher aftermarket demand and successful marketing programs in all markets. The increase in Parts segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues in 2017 was primarily due to higher sales volume.

The major factors for the changes in net sales, cost of sales and gross margin between 2017 and 2016 for the Parts segment are as follows:

•

Aftermarket parts sales volume increased by $270.0 million and related cost of sales increased by $183.6 million due to higher demand in all markets.

•

Average aftermarket parts sales prices increased sales by $45.9 million, reflecting higher price realization in the U.S. and Canada and Europe.

•

Average aftermarket parts direct costs increased $37.5 million due to higher material costs.

•

Warehouse and other indirect costs increased $18.0 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses to support the higher sales volume.

•

The currency translation effect on sales primarily reflects an increase in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a weaker British pound. The currency effect on cost of sales primarily reflects the stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar.

•

Parts gross margins in 2017 decreased to 26.5% from 26.9% in 2016 due to the factors noted above.

Parts SG&A expense for 2017 was $197.6 million compared to $192.7 million in 2016 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses. As a percentage of sales, Parts SG&A was 5.9% in 2017, down from 6.4% in 2016, due to higher net sales.


Financial Services

The Company’s Financial Services segment accounted for 7% of revenues in 2017 and 2016.

New loan and lease volume was $4.33 billion in 2017 compared to $4.22 billion in 2016, primarily due to higher truck deliveries in 2017. PFS finance market share on new PACCAR truck sales was 24.9% in 2017 compared to 26.7% in 2016.

PFS revenues increased to $1.27 billion in 2017 from $1.19 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average operating lease earning assets, and higher used truck sales, partially offset by unfavorable effects of currency translation, which decreased PFS revenues by $.6 million in 2017.

PFS income before income taxes decreased to $261.7 million in 2017 from $305.7 million in 2016, primarily due to lower results on returned lease assets, higher borrowing rates, a higher provision for losses on receivables, and the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher average earning asset balances. The currency exchange impact decreased PFS income before income taxes by $1.2 million in 2017.


Included

in Financial Services “Other Assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of $221.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $267.2 million at December 31, 2016. These trucks are primarily units returned

from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also includes trucks acquired from repossessions or through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales.

The Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $45.1 million in 2017 compared to $16.4 million in 2016, including losses on multiple unit transactions of $29.2 million in 2017 compared to $6.8 million in 2016. Used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were $5.1 million and $3.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The major factors for the changes in interest and fees, interest and other borrowing expenses and finance margin between 2017 and 2016 are outlined below:

•

Average finance receivables increased $89.1 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2017 as a result of retail portfolio new business volume exceeding collections.

•

Average debt balances increased $130.6 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2017. The higher average debt balances reflect funding for a higher average earning assets portfolio, which includes loans, finance leases, wholesale and equipment on operating lease.

•

Higher portfolio yields (4.81% in 2017 compared to 4.77% in 2016) increased interest and fees by $5.3 million. The higher portfolio yields reflect higher lending volumes in North America which have higher market rates than Europe.

•

Higher borrowing rates (1.7% in 2017 compared to 1.5% in 2016) were primarily due to higher debt market rates in North America, partially offset by lower debt market rates in Europe.

•

The currency translation effects reflect a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Mexican peso and the British pound, partially offset by a strengthening euro.

The following table summarizes operating lease, rental and other revenues and depreciation and other expenses:


The major factors for

the changes in operating lease, rental and other revenues, depreciation and other expenses and lease margin between 2017 and 2016 are outlined below:

•

A higher volume of used truck sales increased operating lease, rental and other revenues by $9.7 million and increased depreciation and other expenses by $8.5 million.

•

Results on returned lease assets increased depreciation and other expenses by $31.0 million, primarily due to higher losses on sales of returned lease units.

•

Average operating lease assets increased $223.8 million (excluding foreign exchange effects), which increased revenues by $56.5 million and related depreciation and other expenses by $47.9 million.

•

Revenue per asset increased $5.5 million primarily due to higher rental income. Cost per asset increased $5.1 million due to higher depreciation expense, partially offset by lower vehicle operating expenses.

•

The currency translation effects reflect an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, partially offset by a weakening of the British pound.

The following table summarizes the provision for losses on receivables and net charge-offs:

The provision for losses on receivables was $22.3 million in 2017, an increase of $3.9 million compared to 2016, reflecting higher portfolio balances in Mexico, Australia and other and Europe.

The Company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. When the Company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR).


The post-modification balance of accounts modifi

ed during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized below:

*

Recorded investment immediately after modification as a percentage of the year-end retail portfolio balance.

In 2017, total modification activity decreased compared to 2016, reflecting lower volumes of refinancing for commercial reasons, primarily in the U.S. The decrease in modifications for insignificant delay reflects fewer fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. Credit - TDR modifications decreased to $20.5 million in 2017 from $31.6 million in 2016 mainly due to the contract modifications for two fleet customers in 2016.

The following table summarizes the Company’s 30+ days past due accounts:

Accounts 30+ days past due were .5% at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, reflecting lower past dues in Europe as well as Mexico, Australia and other, offset by an increase in the U.S. and Canada. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.

When the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified $.6 million and $2.6 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively, which were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:

Modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The Company’s 2017 and 2016 annualized pre-tax return on average assets for Financial Services was 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively. The decrease was due primarily to higher losses on used trucks in 2017.


Other

Other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment.

Other also includes the EC charge, non-service cost components of pension (income) expense and a portion of corporate expense.

Other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2017 and 2016. Other SG&A was $50.4 million in 2017 and $44.2 million in 2016. The increase in Other SG&A was primarily due to higher labor related costs.

Other income (loss) before tax was an income of $12.5 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $852.4 million in 2016, which included the impact of the $833.0 million EC charge.

Investment income increased to $35.3 million in 2017 from $27.6 million in 2016, primarily due to higher average U.S. portfolio balances and higher yields on U.S. investments due to higher market interest rates.

Income Taxes

In 2017, the effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 53.8% in 2016. The lower rate is due to the 2017 one-time impact from the change in U.S. tax law as explained below and the unfavorable 2016 impact of the one-time non-deductible expense of $833.0 million for the EC charge.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted new federal income tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”). The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a one-time transition tax on the Company’s foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax and created a modified territorial system. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $304.0 million of deferred tax benefits, due to the re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities at the new lower statutory tax rate. In addition, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $130.6 million of tax expense on the Company’s foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax.

In 2017, the improvement in domestic income before taxes was due to higher truck deliveries and improved aftermarket demand. Foreign income (loss) before taxes improved due to stronger truck and aftermarket demand as well as the 2016 impact of the $833.0 million EC charge.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:

The Company’s total cash and marketable debt securities at December 31, 2018 increased $724.5 million from the balances at December 31, 2017, mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents.


The change in cash and cash

equivalents is summarized below:

2018 Compared to 2017:

Operating activities

: Cash provided by operations increased by $276.5 million to $2.99 billion in 2018 from $2.72 billion in 2017. Higher operating cash flows reflect higher net income of $2.20 billion in 2018 compared to $1.68 billion in 2017, which includes a net deferred tax benefit of $173.9 million primarily due to the 2017 Tax Act. Additionally, there were higher cash inflows of $195.3 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses as purchases of goods and services exceeded payments. The higher cash inflows were offset by a higher increase in Financial Services segment wholesale receivables of $240.3 million and a higher increase in net purchases of inventory of $182.8 million. In addition, the higher cash inflows were offset by an increase of $98.9 million in sales-type finance leases and dealer direct loans, whereby originations exceeded cash receipts in 2018 ($27.0 million) compared to cash receipts exceeding origination in 2017 ($71.9 million). The higher cash inflows were also offset by a net change in derivatives of $82.5 million which was mainly related to the settlement of matured interest rate contracts.

Investing activities

: Cash used in investing activities decreased by $33.9 million to $1.93 billion in 2018 from $1.96 billion in 2017. Lower net cash used in investing activities reflects a $506.4 million increase from marketable debt securities, as there were $315.6 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities in 2018 compared to $190.8 million in net purchases of marketable debt securities in 2017. In addition, there were higher proceeds from asset disposals of $183.0 million. The inflows were partially offset by higher net originations from retail loans and direct financing leases of $541.8 million, higher cash used in the acquisition of equipment on operating leases of $71.5 million, and higher payments for property, plant and equipment of $34.2 million.

Financing activities

: Cash provided by financing activities was $71.1 million in 2018 compared to cash used in financing activities of $393.8 million in 2017. In 2018, the Company issued $2.34 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.76 billion and increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $625.9 million. In 2017, the Company issued $1.67 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.90 billion and increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $352.1 million. This resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $1.21 billion in 2018, $1.09 billion higher than the cash provided by borrowing activities of $125.2 million in 2017. The company paid $804.3 million in dividends in 2018 compared to $558.3 million in 2017; the increase of $246.0 million was primarily due to a special dividend paid in January 2018 that was higher than the special dividend paid in January 2017. In 2018, the Company also repurchased 5.8 million shares of common stock for $354.4 million. There were no stock repurchases in 2017.

2017 Compared to 2016:

Operating activities

: Cash provided by operations increased by $415.0 million to $2.72 billion in 2017. Higher operating cash flows reflect higher net income of $1.68 billion in 2017, compared to net income of $521.7 million in 2016, which includes payment of the $833.0 million EC charge. In addition, there were higher cash inflows of $342.2 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses as purchases of goods and services exceeded payments. The higher cash inflows were offset by wholesale receivables on new trucks of $673.6 million as originations exceeded cash receipts in 2017 ($272.0 million) compared to cash receipts exceeding originations in 2016 ($401.6 million). Additionally, there was a higher cash usage of $214.0 million from inventory due to $149.9 million in net inventory purchases in 2017 versus $64.1 million in net inventory reductions in 2016. Finally, there was a higher cash outflow for payment of income taxes of $160.0 million.


Investing activities

: Cash used in investing activitie

s increased by $400.3 million to $1.96 billion in 2017 from $1.56 billion in 2016. Higher net cash used in investing activities reflects $463.7 million in marketable debt securities as there was $190.8 million in net purchases of marketable debt securities

in 2017 compared to $272.9 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities in 2016. In addition, there were higher net originations of retail loans and direct financing leases of $87.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The outflows were p

artially offset by lower cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of $166.5 million.

Financing activities

: Cash used in financing activities was $393.8 million in 2017 compared to cash used in financing activities of $823.5 million in 2016. The Company paid $558.3 million in dividends in 2017 compared to $829.3 million in 2016; the decrease of $271.0 million was primarily due to a lower special dividend paid in January 2017 than the special dividend paid in January 2016. In 2016, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $70.5 million, while there were no stock repurchases in 2017. In 2017, the Company issued $1.67 billion of term debt, increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $352.1 million and repaid term debt of $1.90 billion. In 2016, the Company issued $1.99 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.63 billion and reduced its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $322.8 million. This resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $125.2 million in 2017, $78.3 million higher than the cash provided by borrowing activities of $46.9 million in 2016.

Credit Lines and Other:

The Company has line of credit arrangements of $3.50 billion, of which $3.27 billion were unused at December 31, 2018. Included in these arrangements are $3.00 billion of syndicated bank facilities, of which $1.00 billion expires in June 2019, $1.00 billion expires in June 2022 and $1.00 billion expires in June 2023. The Company intends to replace these credit facilities on or before expiration with facilities of similar amounts and duration. These credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. There were no borrowings under the syndicated bank facilities for the year ended December 31, 2018.

As of June 30, 2018, the Company completed the repurchase of $300.0 million of the Company’s common stock under the authorization approved in September 2015. On July 9, 2018, PACCAR’s Board of Directors approved another plan to repurchase up to $300.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2018, $260.1 million of shares have been repurchased under this plan. On December 4, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase an additional $500.0 million of PACCAR’s outstanding common stock upon completion of the prior plan.

Truck, Parts and Other

The Company provides funding for working capital, capital expenditures, R&D, dividends, stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations. Management expects this method of funding to continue in the future.

Over the past decade, the Company’s combined investments in worldwide capital projects and R&D totaled $6.04

billion, and have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and enhanced the quality and operating efficiency of the Company’s premium products.

Capital investments in 2019 are expected to be $525 to $575 million, and R&D is expected to be $320 to $350 million. The Company is investing for long-term growth in new truck models, integrated powertrains including zero emission electrification and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, enhanced aerodynamic truck designs, advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity, and expanded manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.

The Company conducts business in certain countries which have been experiencing or may experience significant financial stress, fiscal or political strain and are subject to the corresponding potential for default. The Company routinely monitors its financial exposure to global financial conditions, global counterparties and operating environments. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s exposures in such countries were insignificant.

Financial Services

The Company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets and, to a lesser extent, bank loans. An additional source of funds is loans from other PACCAR companies.


The Company issues commercia

l paper for a portion of its funding in its Financial Services segment. Some of this commercial paper is converted to fixed interest rate debt through the use of interest-rate swaps, which are used to manage interest-rate risk.

In November 2018, the Company’s U.S. finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Corp. (PFC), filed a shelf registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFC as of December 31, 2018 was $4.90 billion. The registration expires in November 2021 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s European finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Europe, had €1.35

billion available for issuance under a €2.50 billion medium-term note program listed on the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange. This program replaced an expiring program in the second quarter of 2018 and is renewable annually through the filing of new listing particulars.

In April 2016, PACCAR Financial Mexico registered a 10.00 billion peso medium-term note and commercial paper program with the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores. The registration expires in April 2021 and limits the amount of commercial paper (up to one year) to 5.00 billion pesos. At December 31, 2018, 7.75 billion pesos were available for issuance.

In August 2018, the Company’s Australian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Pty. Ltd. (PFPL), registered a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFPL as of December 31, 2018 was 150.0 million Australian dollars.

In the event of a future significant disruption in the financial markets, the Company may not be able to issue replacement commercial paper. As a result, the Company is exposed to liquidity risk from the shorter maturity of short-term borrowings paid to lenders compared to the longer timing of receivable collections from customers. The Company believes its cash balances and investments, collections on existing finance receivables, syndicated bank lines and current investment-grade credit ratings of A+/A1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the Company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability. A decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the Company’s ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the Company’s ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability. PACCAR believes its Financial Services companies will be able to continue funding receivables, servicing debt and paying dividends through internally generated funds, access to public and private debt markets and lines of credit.

Commitments

The following summarizes the Company’s contractual cash commitments at December 31, 2018:

*

Commercial paper included in borrowings is at par value.

**

Interest on floating-rate debt is based on the applicable market rates at December 31, 2018.

Total cash commitments for borrowings and interest on term debt are $10.29 billion and were related to the Financial Services segment. As described in Note J of the consolidated financial statements, borrowings consist primarily of term notes and commercial paper issued by the Financial Services segment. The Company expects to fund its maturing Financial Services debt obligations principally from funds provided by collections from customers on loans and lease contracts, as well as from the proceeds of commercial paper and medium-term note borrowings. Purchase obligations are the Company’s contractual commitments to acquire future production inventory and capital equipment. Other obligations include deferred cash compensation.


The Company’s other commitments include the following at December 31, 2018:

Loan and lease commitments are for funding new retail loan and lease contracts. Residual value guarantees represent the Company’s commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value if the customer decides to return the truck at a specified date in the future.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES:

This Form 10-K includes “adjusted net income (non-GAAP)” and “adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP)”, which are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), since they exclude the one-time tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”) in 2017 and the non-recurring European Commission charge in 2016. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the Form 10-K includes the financial ratios noted below calculated based on non-GAAP measures.

Management utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding significant non-recurring items that are not representative of underlying operating trends.

Reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures of adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) are as follows:

*

Calculated using adjusted net income.


IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company, its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment. The Company believes its policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred.

The Company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters. In certain of these matters, the Company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies. The Company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the Company will incur such costs in the future. Expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $1.2 million, $1.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively. While the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined, management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note A of the consolidated financial statements. In the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. The following are accounting policies which, in the opinion of management, are particularly sensitive and which, if actual results are different from estimates used by management, may have a material impact on the financial statements.

Operating Leases

Trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in Note F of the consolidated financial statements. In determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles, the Company considers the length of the lease term, the truck model, the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand. Operating lease terms generally range from three to five years. The resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30% and 70% of original equipment cost. If the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the Company’s estimated residual value, a gain or loss will result.

Future market conditions, changes in government regulations and other factors outside the Company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts. Residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant. A decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term.

During 2018, 2017 and 2016, market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally lower than the residual values on the equipment, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of $31.0 million, $45.5 million and $9.6 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2018, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the Financial Services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the Truck segment was $2.41 billion. A 10% decrease in used truck values worldwide, if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the Company’s operating leases, would reduce residual value estimates and result in the Company recording an average of approximately $69 million of additional depreciation per year.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses related to the Company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in Note E of the consolidated financial statements. The Company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. The retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and sales-type finance leases, net of unearned interest. The wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. The wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. Wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the Company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases, obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets. In determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest, generally over three to five years, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. The allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves.

The Company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment. Finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. A finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the Company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled. In addition, all retail loans and leases which have been classified as TDRs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired. Generally, impaired accounts are on non-accrual status. Impaired accounts classified as TDRs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the Company will collect all principal and interest payments.

Impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent. Large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. The determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral. When the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the Company’s recorded investment, no reserve is recorded. Small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below.


The Company evaluates finance receivables that a

re not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data and current market conditions. Information

used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse. The Company has develop

ed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. A projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses in

herent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers and their ability to repay. After determining the appropriate level of the

allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio.

The adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions. As accounts become past due, the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases. The Company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 30% and 70%. Over the past three years, the Company’s year-end 30+ days past due accounts have ranged between .4% and .5% of loan and lease receivables. Historically, a 100 basis point increase in the 30+ days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 3 to 39 basis points of receivables. At December 31, 2018, 30+ days past dues were .4%. If past dues were 100 basis points higher or 1.4% as of December 31, 2018, the Company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of $2 to $33 million depending on the extent of the past dues, the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors.

Product Warranty

Product warranty is disclosed in Note I of the consolidated financial statements. The expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of recoveries. Management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through quality-improvement programs; however, actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve. Historically those adjustments have not been material. Over the past three years, warranty expense as a percentage of Truck, Parts and Other net sales and revenues has ranged between 1.3% and 1.6%. If the 2018 warranty expense had been .2% higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2018, warranty expense would have increased by approximately $44.3 million.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

This report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements include statements relating to future results of operations or financial position and any other statement that does not relate to any historical or current fact. Such statements are based on currently available operating, financial and other information and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may affect actual results. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: a significant decline in industry sales; competitive pressures; reduced market share; reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; increased safety, emissions, or other regulations resulting in higher costs and/or sales restrictions; currency or commodity price fluctuations; lower used truck prices; insufficient or under-utilization of manufacturing capacity; supplier interruptions; insufficient liquidity in the capital markets; fluctuations in interest rates; changes in the levels of the Financial Services segment new business volume due to unit fluctuations in new PACCAR truck sales or reduced market shares; changes affecting the profitability of truck owners and operators; price changes impacting truck sales prices and residual values; insufficient supplier capacity or access to raw materials; labor disruptions; shortages of commercial truck drivers; increased warranty costs; litigation, including EC settlement-related claims; or legislative and governmental regulations. A more detailed description of these and other risks is included under the heading Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Currencies are presented in millions for the market risks and derivative instruments sections below.

Interest-Rate Risks -

See Note P for a description of the Company’s hedging programs and exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

The Company measures its interest-rate risk by estimating the amount by which the fair value of interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities, including derivative financial instruments, would change assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase across the yield curve as shown in the following table:

Currency Risks -

The Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations of foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso

(see Note P for additional information concerning these hedges)

. Based on the Company’s sensitivity analysis, the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% unfavorable change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be a loss of $101.2 related to contracts outstanding at December 31, 2018, compared to a loss of $55.7 at December 31, 2017. These amounts would be largely offset by changes in the values of the underlying hedged exposures.

A.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Operations:

PACCAR Inc (the Company or PACCAR) is a multinational company operating in three principal segments: (1) the Truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality, light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks; (2) the Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles; and (3) the Financial Services segment (PFS) includes finance and leasing products and services provided to customers and dealers. PACCAR’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to PACCAR products and associated equipment. PACCAR’s sales and revenues are derived primarily from North America and Europe. The Company also operates in Australia and Brasil and sells trucks and parts to customers in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

Truck, Parts and Other:

The Company enters into sales contracts with customers associated with purchases of the Company’s products and services including trucks, parts, product support, and other related services. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue for the amount of consideration it will receive for delivering a product or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of the product or receives benefits of the service. The Company excludes sales taxes, value added taxes and other related taxes assessed by government agencies from revenue. There are no significant financing components included in product or services revenue since generally customers pay shortly after the products or services are transferred. In the Truck and Parts segment, when the Company grants extended payment terms on selected receivables and charges interest, interest income is recognized when earned.

The Company recognizes truck and parts sales as revenue when control of the products is transferred to customers which generally occurs upon shipment, except for certain truck sales which are subject to a residual value guarantee by the Company. The standard payment term for trucks and aftermarket parts is typically within 30 days, but the Company may grant extended payment terms on selected receivables. The Company recognizes revenue for the invoice amount adjusted for estimated sales incentives and returns. Sales incentives and returns are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted to current period revenue when the most likely amount of consideration the Company expects to receive changes or becomes fixed. Truck and part sales include a standard product warranty which is included in cost of sales. The Company has elected to treat delivery services as a fulfillment activity with revenues recognized when the customer obtains control of the product. Delivery revenue is included in revenues and the related costs are included in cost of sales. As a practical expedient, the Company is not disclosing truck order backlog, as a significant majority of the backlog has a duration of less than one year.

Truck sales with residual value guarantee (RVG) that allow customers the option to return their truck are accounted for as a sale when the customer does not have an economic incentive to return the truck to the Company, or as an operating lease when the customer does have an economic incentive to return the truck. The estimate of customers’ economic incentive to return the trucks is based on an analysis of historical guaranteed buyback value and estimated market value. When truck sales with RVGs are accounted for as a sale, revenue is recognized when the truck is transferred to the customer less an amount for expected returns. Expected return rates are estimated by using a historical weighted average return rate over a four-year period. The estimated value of the truck assets to be returned and the related return liabilities at December 31, 2018 were $319.8 and $329.3, respectively. The Company’s total commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value for contracts accounted for as a sale was $705.9 at December 31, 2018.

Revenues from extended warranties, operating leases and other includes optional extended warranty and repair and maintenance service contracts which can be purchased for periods generally ranging up to five years. The Company defers revenue based on stand-alone observable selling prices when it receives payments in advance and generally recognizes the revenue on a straight-line basis over the warranty or repair and maintenance contract periods. See Note I, Product Support Liabilities, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Also included are truck sales with an RVG accounted for as an operating lease. A liability is created for the residual value obligation with the remainder of the proceeds recorded as deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period, which typically ranges from three to five years.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (currencies in millions, except per share data)

Aftermarket parts sales allow for returns which are estimated at the time of sale based on historical data. The estima

ted value of the parts to be returned was $49.0 and the related return liability was $104.5 at December 31, 2018. The Company decreased parts sales by $21.0 in 2018 due to changes in the reserve balance. Parts dealer services and other revenues are recogni

zed as services are performed.

Revenue from winch sales and other is primarily derived from the industrial winch business. Winch sales are recognized when the product is transferred to a customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Also within this category are other revenues not attributable to a reportable segment.

Financial Services:

Interest income from finance and other receivables is recognized using the interest method. Certain loan origination costs are deferred and amortized to interest income over the expected life of the contracts, generally 36 to 60 months, using the straight-line method which approximates the interest method. For operating leases, rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $797.1, $760.9 and $698.9, respectively. Depreciation and related leased unit operating expenses were $686.9, $665.7 and $581.7 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Recognition of interest income and rental revenue is suspended (put on non-accrual status) when the receivable becomes more than 90 days past the contractual due date or earlier if some other event causes the Company to determine that collection is not probable. Accordingly, no finance receivables more than 90 days past due were accruing interest at December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. Recognition is resumed if the receivable becomes current by the payment of all amounts due under the terms of the existing contract and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable (if not contractually modified) or if the customer makes scheduled payments for three months and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable (if contractually modified). Payments received while the finance receivable is on non-accrual status are applied to interest and principal in accordance with the contractual terms.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents consist of liquid investments with a maturity at date of purchase of 90 days or less.

Marketable Debt Securities:

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. These investments are stated at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI).

The Company utilizes third-party pricing services for all of its marketable debt security valuations. The Company reviews the pricing methodology used by the third‑party pricing services, including the manner employed to collect market information. On a quarterly basis, the Company also performs review and validation procedures on the pricing information received from the third‑party providers. These procedures help ensure that the fair value information used by the Company is determined in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.

The Company evaluates its investment in marketable debt securities at the end of each reporting period to determine if a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. Realized losses are recognized upon management’s determination that a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. The determination of other-than-temporary impairment is a subjective process, requiring the use of judgments and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of recovery. The Company reviews and evaluates its investments at least quarterly to identify investments that have indications of other-than-temporary impairments. It is reasonably possible that a change in estimate could occur in the near term relating to other-than-temporary impairment. Accordingly, the Company considers several factors when evaluating debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, including whether the decline in fair value of the security is due to increased default risk for the specific issuer or market interest rate risk.

In assessing default risk, the Company considers the collectability of principal and interest payments by monitoring changes to issuers’ credit ratings, specific credit events associated with individual issuers as well as the credit ratings of any financial guarantor, and the extent and duration to which amortized cost exceeds fair value.

In assessing market interest rate risk, including benchmark interest rates and credit spreads, the Company considers its intent for selling the securities and whether it is more likely than not the Company will be able to hold these securities until the recovery of any unrealized losses.

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (currencies in millions, except per share data)

Receivables:

Trade and Other Receivables:

The Company’s trade and other receivables are recorded at cost, net of allowances. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, trade and other receivables included trade receivables from dealers and customers of $1,103.6 and $962.0 and other receivables of $210.8 and $165.9 relating primarily to value added tax receivables and supplier allowances and rebates.

Finance and Other Receivables:

Loans

– Loans represent fixed or floating-rate loans to customers collateralized by the vehicles purchased and are recorded at amortized cost.

Finance leases

– Finance leases are retail direct financing leases and sales-type finance leases, which lease equipment to retail customers and dealers. These leases are reported as the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and estimated residual value of the property subject to the contracts, reduced by unearned interest which is shown separately.

Dealer wholesale financing

– Dealer wholesale financing is floating-rate wholesale loans to PACCAR dealers for new and used trucks and are recorded at amortized cost. The loans are collateralized by the trucks being financed.

Operating lease receivables and other

– Operating lease receivables and other include monthly rentals due on operating leases, unamortized loan and lease origination costs, interest on loans and other amounts due within one year in the normal course of business.

Allowance for Credit Losses:

Truck, Parts and Other:

The Company historically has not experienced significant losses or past due amounts on trade and other receivables in its Truck, Parts and Other businesses. Accounts are considered past due once the unpaid balance is over 30 days outstanding based on contractual payment terms. Accounts are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, they are considered uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses for Truck, Parts and Other was $1.0 and $1.5 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net charge-offs were $.1 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Financial Services:

The Company continuously monitors the payment performance of its finance receivables. For large retail finance customers and dealers with wholesale financing, the Company regularly reviews their financial statements and makes site visits and phone contact as appropriate. If the Company becomes aware of circumstances that could cause those customers or dealers to face financial difficulty, whether or not they are past due, the customers are placed on a watch list.

The Company modifies loans and finance leases in the normal course of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification.

When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. When the Company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). The Company does not typically grant credit modifications for customers that do not meet minimum underwriting standards since the Company normally repossesses the financed equipment in these circumstances. When such modifications do occur, they are considered TDRs.

On average, modifications extended contractual terms by approximately six months in 2018 and five months in 2017 and did not have a significant effect on the weighted average term or interest rate of the total portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (currencies in millions, except per share data)

The Company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. The retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and sales-type fi

nance leases, net of unearned interest. The wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. The wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. Wholesale re

ceivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the Company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases, obtains guarantees or o

ther security such as dealership assets. In determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and i

nterest, generally over three to five years, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. The allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves.

The Company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment. Finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. A finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the Company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled. In addition, all retail loans and leases which have been classified as TDRs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired. Generally, impaired accounts are on non-accrual status. Impaired accounts classified as TDRs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the Company will collect all principal and interest payments.

Impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent. Large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. The determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral. When the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the Company’s recorded investment, no reserve is recorded. Small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below.

The Company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data and current market conditions. Information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse. The Company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. A projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers and their ability to repay. After determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio.

In determining the fair value of the collateral, the Company uses a pricing matrix and categorizes the fair value as Level 2 in the hierarchy of fair value measurement. The pricing matrix is reviewed quarterly and updated as appropriate. The pricing matrix considers the make, model and year of the equipment as well as recent sales prices of comparable equipment sold individually, which is the lowest unit of account, through wholesale channels to the Company’s dealers (principal market). The fair value of the collateral also considers the overall condition of the equipment.

Accounts are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, they are considered uncollectible, which generally occurs upon repossession of the collateral. Typically the timing between the repossession and charge-off is not significant. In cases where repossession is delayed (e.g., for legal proceedings), the Company records a partial charge-off. The charge-off is determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, to the recorded investment.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost of inventories in the U.S. is determined principally by the last‑in, first-out (LIFO) method. Cost of all other inventories is determined principally by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Cost of sales and revenues include shipping and handling costs incurred to deliver products to dealers and customers.

Equipment on Operating Leases:

The Company’s Financial Services segment leases equipment under operating leases to its customers. In addition, in the Truck segment, equipment sold to customers in Europe subject to an RVG by the Company may be accounted for as an operating lease. Equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on the straight-line basis to the lower of the estimated residual value or guarantee value. Lease and guarantee periods generally range from three to five years. Estimated useful lives of the equipment range from three to nine years. The Company reviews residual values of equipment on operating leases periodically to determine that recorded amounts are appropriate.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (currencies in millions, except per share data)

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is comp

uted principally by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. Certain production tooling is amortized on a unit of production basis.

Long-lived Assets and Goodwill:

The Company evaluates the carrying value of property, plant and equipment when events and circumstances warrant a review. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. There were no significant impairment charges for the three years ended December 31, 2018. Goodwill was $112.0 and $117.4 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in value was mostly due to currency translation.

Product Support Liabilities:

Product support liabilities include estimated future payments related to product warranties and deferred revenues on optional extended warranties and repair and maintenance (R&M) contracts. The Company generally offers one year warranties covering most of its vehicles and related aftermarket parts. For vehicles equipped with engines manufactured by PACCAR, the Company generally offers two year warranties on the engine. Specific terms and conditions vary depending on the product and the country of sale. Optional extended warranty and R&M contracts can be purchased for periods which generally range up to five years. Warranty expenses and reserves are estimated and recorded at the time products or contracts are sold based on historical data regarding the source, frequency and cost of claims, net of any recoveries. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded liabilities and adjusts them as appropriate to reflect actual experience. Revenue from extended warranty and R&M contracts is deferred and recognized to income generally on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Warranty and R&M costs on these contracts are recognized as incurred.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

As part of its risk management strategy, the Company enters into derivative contracts to hedge against interest rates and foreign currency risk. Certain derivative instruments designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges are subject to hedge accounting. Derivative instruments that are not subject to hedge accounting are held as derivatives not designated as hedged instruments. The Company’s policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculation or trading. At the inception of each hedge relationship, the Company documents its risk management objectives, procedures and accounting treatment. All of the Company’s interest-rate and certain foreign-exchange contracts are transacted under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements. Each agreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default and certain other termination events. For derivative financial instruments, the Company has elected not to offset derivative positions in the balance sheet with the same counterparty under the same agreements and is not required to post or receive collateral.

Exposure limits and minimum credit ratings are used to minimize the risks of counterparty default. The Company’s maximum exposure to potential default of its swap counterparties is limited to the asset position of its swap portfolio. The asset position of the Company’s swap portfolio was $84.5 at December 31, 2018.

The Company uses regression analysis to assess effectiveness of interest-rate contracts at inception and uses quantitative analysis to assess subsequent effectiveness on a quarterly basis. For foreign-exchange contracts, the Company performs quarterly assessments to ensure that critical terms continue to match. All components of the derivative instrument’s gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the Company determines that a derivative financial instrument has ceased to be a highly effective hedge. Cash flows from derivative instruments are included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Foreign Currency Translation:

For most of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, the local currency is the functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates and all income statement amounts are translated at the weighted average rates for the period. Translation adjustments are recorded in AOCI. The Company uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for all but one of its Mexican subsidiaries, which uses the local currency. For the U.S. functional currency entities in Mexico, inventories, cost of sales, property, plant and equipment and depreciation are remeasured at historical rates and resulting adjustments are included in net income.

Earnings per Share:

Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the effect of any participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share are computed assuming that all potentially dilutive securities are converted into common shares under the treasury stock method.

New Accounting Pronouncements

New Revenue Standard

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, including subsequently issued ASUs to clarify the implementation guidance in ASU 2014-09. Under the new revenue recognition model, a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted this ASU for outstanding contracts on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2018.

The most significant effect of the standard relates to certain trucks sold in Europe that are subject to an RVG and were accounted for as an operating lease in the Truck, Parts and Other section of the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-09, these sales were recognized on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period. Under the new standard, revenues are recognized upon transfer of control for certain of these RVG contracts that allow customers the option to return their truck and for which there is no economic incentive to do so. The estimate of customers’ economic incentive to return the truck is based on an analysis of historical guaranteed buyback value and estimated market value. A return asset and liability is recognized for estimated returns. Return rates are estimated by using a historical weighted average return rate over a four-year period. Also as required by the new standard, the Company recognized an asset for the value of expected returned aftermarket parts which had previously been netted with the related liabilities.

The cumulative effect of the changes made to the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1, 2018 for the adoption of ASU 2014-09 was as follows:

The following reconciles pro forma amounts as they would have been reported under the prior standard to current reporting:

New Pension Standard

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07,

Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost

. The amendment disaggregates the service cost component from non-service cost components of pension expense and prescribes where to present the various components of pension cost on the income statement. This ASU also allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization, when applicable (e.g. as a cost of manufactured inventory or self-constructed assets). The Company adopted this ASU in January 2018 and accordingly applied the income statement presentation of service and non-service components of pension expense retrospectively and the capitalization of service cost prospectively. Adoption of this ASU had no impact on net income. The retrospective application of this ASU had the following effects on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income:

Other New Accounting Pronouncements:

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02,

Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

. The amendment requires a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings the difference between the historical corporate income tax rate and the newly enacted income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. In December 2018, the Company early adopted this ASU and recorded an entry to reclassify $33.2 million from AOCI to Retained earnings with no impact to Total Stockholders’ Equity.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

. The amendment in this ASU requires entities having financial assets measured at amortized cost to estimate credit reserves under an expected credit loss model rather than the current incurred loss model. Under this new model, expected credit losses will be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. This amendment should be applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842)

, including subsequently issued ASUs to clarify the implementation guidance in ASU 2016-02. Under the new lease standard, lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all leases (other than short-term leases). Lessor accounting is largely unchanged, except for a reduction in the capitalization of certain initial direct costs and the classification of certain cash flows. This ASU may be applied retrospectively in each reporting period presented or modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis.

The Company will elect the package of practical expedients for its leases existing prior to the adoption of this ASU that will retain its conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company will elect the short-term lease exemption to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for any leases with a duration of twelve months or less. The Company expects to add approximately $45 million in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities to the Consolidated Balance Sheets with no impact to Retained earnings. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated Statements of Income.

ASU 2016-02 requires lessors to classify cash receipts from leases within operating activities. As required, the Company will present cash receipts from direct financing leases as an operating cash inflow rather than the current presentation as an investing cash inflow. For the year ended December 31, 2018 total cash receipts from direct financing leases was $1.0 billion. On December 19, 2018, the FASB issued a proposed ASU –

Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements for Lessors

within the scope of ASC 942,

. The proposed ASU would require lessors to classify principal payments received from sales-type and direct financing leases in investing activities in the statement of cash flows. If the proposed ASU is codified, the Company will continue to present cash receipts from direct finance leases as an investing cash inflow and will reclassify cash flows from sales-type leases from operating to investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, total cash originations and cash receipts from sales-type leases were $159.4 million and $189.5 million, respectively.

In addition to adopting the ASUs disclosed above, the Company adopted the following standards effective January 1, 2018, none of which had a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Amortization, accretion, interest and dividend income and realized gains and losses are included in investment income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Gross realized gains were $1.1, $1.4 and $4.4, and gross realized losses were $.8, $.5 and $.1 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Marketable debt securities with continuous unrealized losses and their related fair values were as follows:

For the investment securities in gross unrealized loss positions identified above, the Company does not intend to sell the investment securities. It is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of the unrealized losses, and the Company expects that the contractual principal and interest will be received on the investment securities. As a result, the Company recognized no other-than-temporary impairments

during the periods presented.

FINANCE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

Finance and other receivables include the following:

The net activity of sales-type finance leases, dealer direct loans and dealer wholesale financing on new trucks is shown in the operating section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows since those receivables finance the sale of Company inventory.

Annual minimum payments due on finance receivables are as follows:

Estimated residual values included with finance leases amounted to $312.9 in 2018 and $340.9 in 2017. Experience indicates substantially all of dealer wholesale financing will be repaid within one year. In addition, repayment experience indicates that some loans, leases and other finance receivables will be paid prior to contract maturity, while others may be extended or modified.

For the following credit quality disclosures, finance receivables are classified into two portfolio segments, wholesale and retail. The retail portfolio is further segmented into dealer retail and customer retail. The dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to PACCAR dealers. The dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises that use the proceeds to fund customers’ acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment. The customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for the acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment. Customer retail receivables are further segregated between fleet and owner/operator classes. The fleet class consists of customer retail accounts operating more than five trucks. All other customer retail accounts are considered owner/operator. These two classes have similar measurement attributes, risk characteristics and common methods to monitor and assess credit risk.

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (currencies in millions, except per share data)

Credit Quality:

The Company's customers are principally concentrated in the transportation industry in North America, Europe and Australia. The Company’s portfolio assets are diversifie

d over a large number of customers and dealers with no single customer or dealer balances representing over 5% of the total portfolio assets. The Company retains as collateral a security interest in the related equipment.

At the inception of each contract, the Company considers the credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors credit quality based on past due status and collection experience as there is a meaningful correlation between the past due status of customers and the risk of loss.

The Company has three credit quality indicators: performing, watch and at-risk. Performing accounts pay in accordance with the contractual terms and are not considered high-risk. Watch accounts include accounts 31 to 90 days past due and large accounts that are performing but are considered to be high‑risk. Watch accounts are not impaired. At-risk accounts are accounts that are impaired, including TDRs, accounts over 90 days past due and other accounts on non-accrual status. The tables below summarize the Company’s finance receivables by credit quality indicator and portfolio class.

The tables below summarize the Company’s finance receivables by aging category. In determining past due status, the Company considers the entire contractual account balance past due when any installment is over 30 days past due. Substantially all customer accounts that were greater than 30 days past due prior to credit modification became current upon modification for aging purposes.

Troubled Debt Restructurings:

The balance of TDRs was $20.1 and $37.9

at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At modification date, the pre-modification and post-modification recorded investment balances for finance receivables modified during the period by portfolio class are as follows:

The effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

TDRs modified during the previous twelve months that subsequently defaulted (i.e., became more than 30 days past due) in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were nil and $4.9, respectively, as shown below by portfolio class:

There were nil and $1.6 of finance receivables modified as TDRs during the previous twelve months that subsequently defaulted and were charged off for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Repossessions:

When the Company determines a customer is not likely to meet its contractual commitments, the Company repossesses the vehicles which serve as collateral for the loans, finance leases and equipment under operating leases. The Company records the vehicles as used truck inventory included in Financial Services Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balance of repossessed inventory at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $10.8 and $13.1, respectively. Proceeds from the sales of repossessed assets were $75.8, $58.3 and $51.7 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts are included in Proceeds from asset disposals in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Write-downs of repossessed equipment on operating leases are recorded as impairments and included in Financial Services Depreciation and other expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (currencies in millions, except per share data)

The annual maturities of the Financial Services borrowings are as follows:

Interest paid on borrowings was $166.5, $127.4 and $108.2 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company capitalized nil interest on borrowings for all periods presented, in Truck, Parts and Other.

The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets, and to a lesser extent, bank loans. The medium-term notes are issued by PACCAR Financial Corp. (PFC), PACCAR Financial Europe, PACCAR Financial Mexico and PACCAR Financial Pty. Ltd. (PFPL).

In November 2018, the Company’s U.S. finance subsidiary, PFC, filed a shelf registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFC as of December 31, 2018 was $4,900.0. The registration expires in November 2021 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s European finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Europe, had

€1,350.0

available for issuance under a €2,500.0 medium-term note program listed on the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange. This program replaced an expiring program in the second quarter of 2018 and is renewable annually through the filing of new listing particulars.

In April 2016, PACCAR Financial Mexico registered a 10,000.0 pesos medium-term note and commercial paper program with the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores. The registration expires in April 2021 and limits the amount of commercial paper (up to one year) to 5,000.0 pesos. At December 31, 2018, 7,750.0 pesos remained available for issuance.

In August 2018, the Company’s Australian subsidiary, PFPL, registered a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFPL as of December 31, 2018 was 150.0 Australian dollars.

The Company has line of credit arrangements of $3,500.8, of which $3,269.0 were unused at December 31, 2018. Included in these arrangements are $3,000.0 of syndicated bank facilities, of which $1,000.0 expires in June 2019, $1,000.0 expires in June 2022 and $1,000.0 expires in June 2023. The Company intends to replace these credit facilities on or before expiration with facilities of similar amounts and duration. These credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. There were no borrowings under the syndicated bank facilities for the year ended December 31, 2018.

K.

LEASES

The Company leases certain facilities and computer equipment under operating leases. Leases expire at various dates through the year 2026. At January 1, 2019, annual minimum rent payments under non-cancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year are $18.2, $14.1, $9.0, $5.8, $2.2 and $1.2 thereafter. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, total rental expenses under all leases amounted to $35.7, $30.1 and $28.8, respectively.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

At December 31, 2018, PACCAR had standby letters of credit and surety bonds totaling $49.9, from third-party financial institutions, in the normal course of business, which guarantee various insurance, financing and other activities. At December 31, 2018, PACCAR’s financial services companies, in the normal course of business, had outstanding commitments to fund new loan and lease transactions amounting to $1,122.3. The commitments generally expire in 90 days. The Company had other commitments, primarily to purchase production inventory, equipment and energy amounting to $132.0, $75.0, $59.6, $58.0 and nil for 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and beyond, respectively.

The Company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters. In certain of these matters, the Company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies. The Company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the Company will incur such costs in the future. Expenditures related to environmental activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $1.2, $1.9 and $2.2, respectively.

While the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined, management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position.

On July 19, 2016, the European Commission (EC) concluded its investigation of all major European truck manufacturers and reached a settlement with DAF. Following the settlement, claims and lawsuits have been filed against the Company, DAF and certain DAF subsidiaries and other truck manufacturers. Others may bring EC-related claims and lawsuits against the Company or its subsidiaries. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses, such claims and lawsuits will likely take a significant period of time to resolve. An adverse outcome of such proceedings could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

PACCAR is also a defendant in various other legal proceedings and, in addition, there are various other contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of business. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that disposition of these various other proceedings and contingent liabilities will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Severance Costs:

The Company incurred severance expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016 of $.7, $.8 and $2.0, respectively.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans:

The Company has several defined benefit pension plans, which cover a majority of its employees. The Company evaluates its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and considers changes based upon market conditions and other factors.

The expected return on plan assets is determined by using a market-related value of assets, which is calculated based on an average of the previous five years of asset gains and losses.

Generally, accumulated unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the 10% corridor approach. The corridor is defined as the greater of either 10% of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. The amortization amount is the excess beyond the corridor divided by the average remaining estimated service life of participants on a straight-line basis.

The Company funds its pensions in accordance with applicable employee benefit and tax laws. The Company contributed $88.9 to its pension plans in 2018 and $70.6 in 2017. The Company expects to contribute in the range of $70.0 to $100.0 to its pension plans in 2019, of which $23.2 is estimated to satisfy minimum funding requirements. Annual benefits expected to be paid beginning January 1, 2019 are $88.8, $92.1, $99.0, $105.7, $111.5 and a total of $642.0 for the five years thereafter.

Plan assets are invested in global equity and debt securities through professional investment managers with the objective to achieve targeted risk adjusted returns and maintain liquidity sufficient to fund current benefit payments. Typically, each defined benefit plan has an investment policy that includes a target for asset mix, including maximum and minimum ranges for allocation percentages by investment category. The actual allocation of assets may vary at times based upon rebalancing policies and other factors. The Company periodically assesses the target asset mix by evaluating external sources of information regarding the long-term historical return, volatilities and expected future returns for each investment category. In addition, the long-term rates of return assumptions for pension accounting are reviewed annually to ensure they are appropriate. Target asset mix and forecast long-term returns by asset category are considered in determining the assumed long-term rates of return, although historical returns realized are given some consideration.

The fair value of mutual funds, common stocks and U.S. treasuries is determined using the

market approach and is based on the quoted prices in active markets. These securities are categorized as Level 1. The fair value of debt securities is determined using the market approach and is based on the quoted market prices of the securities or other

observable inputs. These securities are categorized as Level 2.

The fair value of commingled trust funds is determined using the market approach and is based on the unadjusted net asset value (NAV) per unit as determined by the sponsor of the fund based on the fair values of underlying investments. These assets are collective investment trusts, and substantially all of these investments have no redemption restrictions or unfunded commitments. Securities measured at NAV per unit as a practical expedient are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Multi-employer Plans:

The Company participates in multi-employer plans in the U.S. and Europe. These are typically under collective bargaining agreements and cover its union-represented employees. The Company’s participation in the following multi-employer plans for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

The Company contributions shown in the table above approximate the multi-employer pension expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Metal and Electrical Engineering Industry Pension Fund is a multi-employer union plan incorporating all DAF employees in the Netherlands and is covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expired on May 31, 2018; a new agreement is currently under negotiation. The Company’s contributions were less than 5% of the total contributions to the plan for the last two reporting periods ending December 2018. The plan is required by law (the Netherlands Pension Act) to have a coverage ratio in excess of 104.3%. Because the coverage ratio of the plan was 97.6% at December 31, 2018, a funding improvement plan effective through 2027 is in place. The funding improvement plan includes a possible reduction in pension benefits and delays in future benefit increases.

The Western Metal Industry Pension Plan is located in the U.S. and is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on November 1, 2020. In accordance with the U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006, the plan was certified as critical (red) status as of December 31, 2018, and a funding improvement plan was implemented requiring additional contributions through 2022 as long as the plan remains in critical status. Contributions by the Company were 14% and 7% of the total contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Other plans are principally located in the U.S. for the last two reporting periods, none were under funding improvement plans and Company contributions to these plans are less than 5% of each plan’s total contributions.

There were no significant changes for the multi-employer plans in the periods presented that affected comparability between periods.

Defined Contribution Plans:

The Company maintains several defined contribution benefit plans whereby it contributes designated amounts on behalf of participant employees. The largest plan is for U.S. salaried employees where the Company matches a percentage of employee contributions up to an annual limit. The match was 5% of eligible pay in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Other plans are located in Australia, Brasil, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Expenses for these plans were $45.3, $37.9 and $34.1 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

N.

INCOME TAXES

The Company’s tax rate is based on income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Tax law requires certain items to be included in the Company’s tax returns at different times than the items reflected in the Company’s financial statements. As a result, the Company’s annual tax rate reflected in its financial statements is different than that reported in its tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the Company’s tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The components of the Company’s income before income taxes include the following:

The components of the Company’s provision for income taxes include the following:

Tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carryforwards were $5.0, $4.3 and $1.2 for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (currencies in millions, except per share data)

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted new federal income tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”). The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a one-time transition tax on

the Company’s foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax and created a modified territorial system. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $304.0 of deferred tax benefits, due to the re-measurement of net d

eferred tax liabilities at the new lower statutory tax rate. In addition, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $130.6 of tax expense on the Company’s foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax. As of December 31, 2018

, the Company does not expect any further adjustments for the provisional amounts recorded.

Based on the Company’s current operations, the Company does not expect that the repatriation of future foreign earnings will be subject to significant income tax as a result of the U.S. modified territorial system.

Included in domestic taxable income for 2016 are

$180.4 of foreign earnings which are not indefinitely reinvested, for which domestic taxes of

$7.1 were provided to account for the difference between the domestic and foreign tax rate on those earnings.

At December 31, 2018, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $393.3, of which $297.2 related to foreign subsidiaries and $96.1 related to states in the U.S. The related deferred tax asset was $102.1, for which an $89.0 valuation allowance has been provided. The carryforward periods range from three years to indefinite, subject to certain limitations under applicable laws. The future tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards are evaluated on a regular basis, including a review of historical and projected operating results.

The tax effects of temporary differences representing deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

The balance sheets classification of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

The Company recognized $(.1), $.2 and $1.9 of income related to interest in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Accrued interest expense and penalties were $1.1, $1.1 and $.9 as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

As part of its risk management strategy, the Company enters into derivative contracts to hedge against interest rate and foreign currency risk.

Interest-Rate Contracts:

The Company enters into various interest-rate contracts, including interest-rate swaps and cross currency interest-rate swaps. Interest-rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate or floating for fixed rate interest payments based on the contractual notional amounts in a single currency. Cross currency interest-rate swaps involve the exchange of notional amounts and interest payments in different currencies. The Company is exposed to interest-rate and exchange-rate risk caused by market volatility as a result of its borrowing activities. The objective of these contracts is to mitigate the fluctuations on earnings, cash flows and fair value of borrowings. Net amounts paid or received are reflected as adjustments to interest expense.

Forei

gn-Exchange Contracts:

The Company enters into foreign-exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated transactions and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Australian

dollar, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. The objective is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2018, the notional amount of the outstanding foreign-exchange co

ntracts was $674.6. Foreign-exchange contracts mature within one year.

The following table presents the balance sheet classification, fair value, gross and pro forma net amounts of derivative financial instruments:

Fair Value Hedges

Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with the changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. As of December 31, 2018, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:

The above table excludes the cumulative basis adjustments on discounted hedge relationships of ($2.9) million as of December 31, 2018.

The following table presents the location and amount of (income) expense on fair value hedges recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The loss (gain) on fair value hedges for foreign-exchange contracts was nil for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The amounts related to interest-rate contracts were as follows:

Cash Flow Hedges

Substantially all of the Company’s interest-rate contracts and some foreign-exchange contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI. Amounts in AOCI are reclassified into net income in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 9.5 years.

The following table presents the pre-tax effects of derivative instruments recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI):

The following presents the amount of (gain) loss from cash flow hedges reclassified from AOCI into income:

The amount of gain recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2018 that is estimated to be reclassified into earnings in the following 12 months if interest rates and exchange rates remain unchanged is approximately $9.8, net of taxes. The fixed interest earned on finance receivables will offset the amount recognized in interest expense, resulting in a stable interest margin consistent with the Company’s risk management strategy.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (currencies in millions, except per share data)

The amount of gains or losses reclassified out of AOCI into net income based on the probability that the original fore

casted transactions would not occur was nil for the year ended December 31, 2018, nil for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a loss of $

.3

for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments

For other risk management purposes, the Company enters into derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivative instruments are used to mitigate the risk of market volatility arising from borrowings and foreign currency denominated transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs.

The expense (income) recognized in earnings related to derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was as follows:

Q.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value are either observable or unobservable. These inputs have been categorized into the fair value hierarchy described below.

Level 1 – Valuations are based on quoted prices that the Company has the ability to obtain in actively traded markets for identical assets or liabilities. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market or exchange traded market, valuation of these instruments does not require a significant degree of judgment.

Level 2 – Valuations are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.

Level 3 – Valuations are based on model-based techniques for which some or all of the assumptions are obtained from indirect market information that is significant to the overall fair value measurement and which require a significant degree of management judgment.

There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period.

The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to measure fair value for assets and liabilities subject to recurring fair value measurements.

Marketable Securities:

The Company’s marketable debt securities consist of municipal bonds, government obligations, investment-grade corporate obligations, commercial paper, asset-backed securities and term deposits. The fair value of U.S. government obligations is determined using the market approach and is based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (currencies in millions, except per share data)

The fair value of U.S. government agency obligations, non-U.S. government bonds, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, commercial paper and term deposits is determined using the market approach and is primarily base

d on matrix pricing as a practical expedient which does not rely exclusively on quoted prices for a specific security. Significant inputs used to determine fair value include interest rates, yield curves, credit rating of the security and other observable

market information and are categorized as Level 2.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

The Company’s derivative contracts consist of interest-rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts. These derivative contracts are traded over the counter and their fair value is determined using industry standard valuation models, which are based on the income approach (i.e., discounted cash flows). The significant observable inputs into the valuation models include interest rates, yield curves, currency exchange rates, credit default swap spreads and forward rates and are categorized as Level 2.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Recurring Fair Value Measurement

The Company’s assets and liabilities subject to recurring fair value measurements are either Level 1 or Level 2 as follows:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (currencies in millions, except per share data)

Fair Value Disclosure of Other Financial Instruments

For financial instruments that are not recognized at fair value, the Company uses the following methods and assumptions to determine the fair value. These instruments are categorized as Level 2, except cash which is categorized as Level 1 and fixed rate loans which are categorized as Level 3.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Financial Services Net Receivables:

For floating-rate loans, wholesale financing, and operating lease and other trade receivables, carrying values approximate fair values. For fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated using the income approach by discounting cash flows to their present value based on assumptions regarding the credit and market risks to approximate current rates for comparable loans. Finance lease receivables and related allowance for credit losses have been excluded from the accompanying table.

Debt:

The carrying amounts of financial services commercial paper, variable rate bank loans and variable rate term notes approximate fair value. For fixed rate debt, fair values are estimated using the income approach by discounting cash flows to their present value based on current rates for comparable debt.

The Company’s estimate of fair value for fixed rate loans and debt that are not carried at fair value was as follows:

STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

PACCAR has certain plans under which officers and key employees may be granted options to purchase shares of the Company’s authorized but unissued common stock under plans approved by stockholders. Non‑employee directors and certain officers may be granted restricted shares of the Company’s common stock under plans approved by stockholders. Options outstanding under these plans were granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Options expire no later than ten years from the grant date and generally vest after three years. Restricted stock awards generally vest over three years or earlier upon meeting certain age and service requirements.

The Company recognizes compensation cost on these options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite period the employee is required to render service less estimated forfeitures based on historical experience. The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock authorized for issuance under these plans is 46.7 million shares, and as of December 31, 2018, the maximum number of shares available for future grants was 13.3 million.

The estimated fair value of each option award is determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions noted in the following table. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility. The dividend yield is based on an estimated future dividend yield using projected net income for the next five years, implied dividends and Company stock price. The expected term is based on the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical experience.

The fair value of options granted was $6.3, $6.4 and $6.0 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $5.3, $5.2 and $7.8, respectively.

SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

PACCAR operates in three principal segments: Truck, Parts and Financial Services. The Company evaluates the performance of its Truck and Parts segments based on operating profits, which excludes investment income, other income and expense, the EC charge, and income taxes. The Financial Services segment’s performance is evaluated based on income before income taxes. Geographic revenues from external customers are presented based on the country of the customer. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements as described in Note A.

Truck and Parts:

The Truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality, light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks and the Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles, both of which are sold through the same network of independent dealers. These segments derive a large proportion of their revenues and operating profits from operations in North America and Europe. The Truck segment incurs substantial costs to design, manufacture and sell trucks to its customers. The sale of new trucks provides the Parts segment with the basis for parts sales that may continue over the life of the truck, but are generally concentrated in the first five years after truck delivery. To reflect the benefit the Parts segment receives from costs incurred by the Truck segment, certain expenses are allocated from the Truck segment to the Parts segment. The expenses allocated are based on a percentage of the average annual expenses for factory overhead, engineering, research and development and SG&A expenses for the preceding five years. The allocation is based on the ratio of the average parts direct margin dollars (net sales less material and labor costs) to the total truck and parts direct margin dollars for the previous five years. The Company believes such expenses have been allocated on a reasonable basis. Truck segment assets related to the indirect expense allocation are not allocated to the Parts segment.

Financial Services:

The Financial Services segment derives its earnings primarily from financing or leasing of PACCAR products and services provided to truck customers and dealers. Revenues are primarily generated from operations in North America and Europe.

Other:

Included in Other is the Company’s industrial winch manufacturing business as well as sales, income and expense not attributable to a reportable segment. Other also includes non-service cost components of pension (income) expense, a portion of corporate expenses and the EC charge in 2016. Intercompany interest (expense) income on cash advances to the financial services companies is included in Other and was $(.3), nil and $.4 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

management’s report on internal control over

financial reporting

The management of PACCAR Inc (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control

–

Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.

Ernst & Young LLP, the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report is included on page 81.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
