                                     PART I
Item 1: Business

The Company

The registrant,  W.W. Grainger,  Inc., was incorporated in the State of Illinois
in  1928.  It is a  leader  in the  distribution  of  maintenance,  repair,  and
operating  supplies  and  related  information  to the  commercial,  industrial,
contractor,  and institutional  markets in North America.  W.W.  Grainger,  Inc.
regards  itself as a service  business.  As used  herein,  "Company"  means W.W.
Grainger, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries as the context may require.

During 1996, the Company acquired the Canadian industrial  distribution business
of Acklands  Limited,  Canada's  largest  nationwide  distributor  of broad line
industrial  supplies.  The Company also completed the integration of its Bossert
Industrial  Supply  (production  consumable  products)  unit  into its  Grainger
store-based   business.   With  the  completion  of  this  integration  and  the
acquisition,  the Company  operates  four  business  units:  Grainger,  the core
store-based business (a distributor of maintenance,  repair, and operating (MRO)
supplies  and  related  information),  Acklands  -  Grainger  Inc.  (a  Canadian
nationwide  distributor  of industrial  supplies),  Lab Safety  Supply,  Inc. (a
direct marketer of safety equipment and related industrial products),  and Parts
Company of America (a distributor of repair and replacement parts).

The Company  utilizes a satellite  communications  network  which  substantially
reduces  its  reliance  on phone  lines by linking  stores and other  facilities
together  via a  network  control  center.  This  capability  results  in almost
instantaneous  transmittal  of  information,  which  expedites the completion of
sales transactions and the initiation of stock replenishment.

The  Company  does not  engage  in basic or  substantive  product  research  and
development activities. New items are added regularly to its product line on the
basis of market  information  as well as on  recommendations  of its  employees,
customers, and suppliers, and other factors.

Grainger

The  Company's  Grainger  store-based  business is a nationwide  distributor  of
industrial and commercial  equipment and supplies.  It distributes  motors, HVAC
equipment,  lighting, hand and power tools, pumps, electrical equipment, as well
as many other items.  During 1996,  the Company  completed  the  integration  of
Bossert  Industrial  Supply into  Grainger in order to enhance its position as a
distributor of production consumable products.

Grainger  provides support  functions and coordination and guidance in the areas
of Accounting,  Administrative Services, Aviation, Communications,  Compensation
and Benefits, Data Systems and Data Processing,  Employee Development,  Finance,
Government  Regulations,  Human Resources,  Industrial Relations,  Insurance and
Risk Management,  Internal Audit, Legal, Planning,  Real Estate and Construction
Services,  Security and Safety, Taxes, and Treasury Services. These services are
provided in varying degrees to the other business units.

Grainger is an  important  resource  for both  product and  procurement  process
information.  Grainger  provides  technical  information  on products as well as
information on historic  usage of products to customers.  Grainger also provides
feedback to suppliers concerning their products.

Grainger  sells  principally  to  contractors,  service  shops,  industrial  and
commercial maintenance departments,  manufacturers,  hotels, and health care and
educational  facilities.  Sales transactions  during 1996 averaged $137 and were
made to more than 1,300,000  customers.  Sales to the largest  single  customer,
General  Motors  Corporation,  were  0.9%  of  sales.  Grainger  estimates  that
approximately  28% of 1996  sales  consisted  of  items  bearing  the  Company's
registered  trademarks,  including "DAYTON(R)"  (principally electric motors and
ventilation  equipment),  "DEMCO(R)" (power transmission  belts),  "DEM-KOTE(R)"
(spray paints),  "SPEEDAIRE(R)" (air compressors),  and "TEEL(R)" (liquid pumps)
as well as other  trademarks.  The  Company  has taken  steps to  protect  these
trademarks against infringement and believes that they will remain available for
future use in its  business.  Sales of remaining  items  generally  consisted of
other well recognized brands.

Grainger  purchases  from more than  1,000  product  suppliers  for its  General
Catalog, most of whom are manufacturers, and numerous other suppliers in support
of Grainger Integrated Supply Operations (GISO). The largest supplier in 1996, a
diversified  manufacturer  through 22 of its  divisions,  accounted for 11.2% of
purchases.  No  significant  difficulty  has been  encountered  with  respect to
sources of supply.


                                      (3)


Grainger offers its line of products at competitive  prices through a network of
stores in the United  States and Mexico (349 at December 31,  1996).  An average
store has 15 employees and handles about 260  transactions per day. During 1996,
an average of 93,300 sales transactions were completed daily. Each store tailors
its inventory to local customer  preferences and actual product demand. In 1996,
Grainger  invested more than  $31,000,000 in the  continuation of its facilities
optimization  program,  which  consisted of new stores,  relocated  stores,  and
additions to stores.  Grainger enhanced its marketing  capabilities in Mexico by
opening its first foreign-based store in Monterrey.

Grainger  has  six  Zone  Distribution  Centers  (ZDCs)  in  operation.  The ZDC
logistics  strategy  provides  a  break-bulk  function  for faster  store  stock
replenishment.  In addition,  ZDCs handle shipped orders for their zone and also
offer a logistical  solution for  integrated  supply  customers by  coordinating
complex orders and multiple receipts, and combining them into a single shipment.
By reducing order and receipt  complexity at the store,  greater capacity within
the distribution system is created.

Large  computer  controlled  stocks,   which  are  maintained  at  two  Regional
Distribution Centers (RDCs),  located in Greenville County, South Carolina,  and
Kansas City, Missouri,  and a National  Distribution Center (NDC) in the Chicago
area, provide the branches and customers with protection against variable demand
and delayed factory  deliveries.  The NDC is a centralized  storage and shipment
facility servicing the entire network with slower moving inventory items.

Grainger serves all sizes and types of customers,  and accommodates a variety of
purchase situations and preferences.

Grainger   employs  account  managers  who  call  on  existing  and  prospective
customers. In addition, a sales force of market specialists and National Account
specialists  has been  developed  to serve  individualized  markets and National
Accounts.  Grainger employed 1,608 account  managers,  market  specialists,  and
National Account specialists at December 31, 1996.

The Grainger  National  Accounts  Program  focuses on meeting the needs of large
multi-site  businesses by simplifying  customers' MRO purchasing  activities and
providing consistent service and pricing to each customer location.  Daily sales
to National Account customers increased 20%, on a comparable basis, in 1996 over
the prior year.  National Account  relationships have been established with over
400 of the nation's largest companies.

The Company  continued to enhance the  capabilities  of GISO.  As an  integrated
supplier,  GISO  provides  access to over three  million  products  and numerous
services,  thereby  assisting  its  customers  in  reducing  the  number  of MRO
suppliers and streamlining their procurement processes. GISO extends the product
reach of the Grainger  General  Catalog by offering  the full  product  lines of
strategic suppliers.  Grainger has agreements with "Best-in-Class" distributors,
which provide depth in a particular  product grouping.  These  distributors sell
their  products  through GISO as the  integrator,  while  continuing  to provide
technical assistance directly to the customer.

In 1996,  Grainger  continued to develop its "Alliance  Partner"  relationships.
"Alliance  Partners"  participate in the full integration of technical  support,
consolidated  invoicing,  and  consolidated  payment.  These  alliances  provide
Grainger with enhanced capabilities in developing the MRO supply marketplace.

Integrated  supply  customers  lower their MRO costs by  reengineering  internal
business processes and adopting new materials  management systems and practices.
An important part of Grainger's solution is Grainger Consulting Services,  which
provides  customers with expertise in process  mapping,  process  reengineering,
benchmarking,  inventory management,  supplier management, and systems analysis.
During 1996,  Grainger  Consulting  Services  enhanced its  capabilities,  while
working on numerous engagements with Fortune 500 companies.

Grainger  uses direct  marketing  for  customers  who prefer a direct  marketing
approach or are too small to warrant  in-person sales calls.  Direct mailings to
these customers make them aware of Grainger's  capabilities.  Grainger  provides
these customers,  who are usually small to medium-sized  businesses,  with a low
total cost solution for their MRO needs.

An  important  selling  tool is the General  Catalog,  which has been  published
continuously  since 1927 and has grown to 4,116 pages  listing over 78,000 items
together with extensive  technical and application  data.  Before being added to
the General  Catalog,  a new item must satisfy many  evaluation  tests and other
rigid  requirements.  For 1996,  approximately  2,000,000  copies of the General
Catalog were published. The most current edition was issued in January 1997.



                                      (4)



The Grainger  Electronic  Catalog  brings  directly to the  customer's  place of
business a fast, easy way to select and order products. It is a state-of-the-art
system that uses PC-based software and CD-ROM technology. Through the Electronic
Catalog,  the customer  can use a variety of ways to describe a needed  product,
and then review Grainger's offerings, complete with specifications,  prices, and
pictures.  Other Electronic Catalog features include a cross-reference  function
that allows  customers  to retrieve  product  information  using their own stock
numbers.  More than 100,000  copies of the  Electronic  Catalog are currently in
use. The Electronic  Catalog is also used at the stores as a training tool and a
resource for identifying appropriate products for customers' applications.

In  1996,   Grainger   enhanced  the  capabilities  of  its  internet  Web  site
(http://www.grainger.com)  by adding an interactive  on-line catalog and on-line
ordering capabilities. The Web site contains useful information about Grainger's
products and services and provides an  alternative  way for  customers to access
Grainger.

Acklands - Grainger Inc.

On December 2, 1996, the Company acquired the Canadian  industrial  distribution
business of Acklands Limited,  Canada's largest nationwide  distributor of broad
line industrial supplies.  The Industrial Group of Acklands Limited had sales of
over $300  million for the fiscal  year ended  January 31,  1996.  The  acquired
entity is  operated  as a separate  business  unit under the name of  Acklands -
Grainger Inc. (AGI). This acquisition will provide the opportunity to expand the
Company's market share in Canada and better serve the Canadian operations of the
Company's National Account customers.

Lab Safety Supply, Inc. (Lab Safety) and Parts Company of America (PCA)

Lab  Safety  is a  leading  national  direct  marketer  of  safety  and  related
industrial  products,  serving about 350,000  customers  from its  facilities in
Janesville,  Wisconsin.  Lab Safety serves the safety products markets with such
items as respiratory systems,  protective clothing,  and other equipment used in
the workplace and in environmental  clean-up operations.  The current Lab Safety
General  Catalog,  its  primary  selling  tool,  has over 1,300  pages,  listing
approximately  36,000 items. During 1996, an average of 4,000 sales transactions
were completed daily.

PCA continues to expand its  distribution of repair and replacement  parts.  PCA
distributes  approximately  200,000 parts, takes orders 24 hours a day, 365 days
per year, and ships stocked items within 24 hours of an order,  most on the same
business day. PCA provides  value to customers by being a single source for many
different replacement parts and by offering technical  assistance.  PCA provides
the customer fast and easy access to name brand parts for most products found in
the Grainger General Catalog,  as well as for many other products.  During 1996,
an average of 2,400 sales transactions were completed daily.

Industry Segments

The Company has concluded that its business is within a single industry segment.
For information as to the Company's  consolidated revenue and operating earnings
see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the
Results of  Operations,"  and Item 8,  "Financial  Statements and  Supplementary
Data."  The total  assets of the  Company  for the last five years  were:  1996,
$2,119,021,000;    1995,    $1,669,243,000;    1994,    $1,534,751,000;    1993,
$1,376,664,000; and 1992, $1,310,538,000.

Competition

The Company faces competition in all the markets it serves,  from  manufacturers
(including  some of the Company's own  suppliers)  that sell directly to certain
segments of the market,  from wholesale  distributors,  catalog houses, and from
certain retail enterprises.

The principal means by which the Company competes with  manufacturers  and other
distributors is by providing local stocks,  efficient service, account managers,
competitive prices, its several catalogs, which include product descriptions and
in certain cases,  extensive technical and application data, procurement process
consulting  services,  and other efforts to assist  customers in lowering  their
total MRO costs. The Company believes that it can effectively compete on a price
basis  with its  manufacturing  competitors  on  small  orders,  but  that  such
manufacturers may enjoy a cost advantage in filling large orders.

                                      (5)


The Company serves a number of diverse  markets,  and is able in some markets to
reasonably  estimate  the  Company's  competitive  position  within that market.
However,  taken as a whole, the Company is unable to determine its market shares
relative to others engaged in whole or in part in similar activities.

Employees

As of December 31, 1996, the Company had 14,601  employees,  of whom 12,180 were
full-time  and 2,421 were  part-time or  temporary.  The Company has never had a
major work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are good.

Item 2: Properties

As of  December  31,  1996,  the  Company's  Grainger  store  locations  totaled
7,698,000 square feet, an increase of approximately  3.5% over 1995. Most stores
are  located in or near major  metropolitan  areas,  many in  industrial  parks.
Stores range in size from 2,000 to 109,000 square feet and average approximately
22,000  square  feet.  A typical  owned  store is on one  floor,  is of  masonry
construction, consists primarily of warehouse space, contains an air conditioned
office  and  sales  area,  and has  off-the-street  parking  for  customers  and
employees.  The Company  considers  that its  properties  are  generally in good
condition  and well  maintained,  and are  suitable and adequate to carry on the
Company's business.

The significant facilities of the Company are briefly described below:

                                                                       Size in

The Company is  constructing  an office facility to house a large portion of the
Company's  Chicago-area  office  workforce  on owned  property  in Lake  Forest,
Illinois.  Construction  of the  facility  has  started  and is  expected  to be
completed  during 1999.  It is expected that most  Chicago-area  owned or leased
general  office  facilities  occupied  in 1996  will be  vacated  when  this new
facility becomes operational.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) These  facilities  are either owned or leased with leases  expiring  between

Note:  Net earnings,  excluding  restructuring  charges,  as a percentage of net
sales  were  5.9%  and 5.7% for 1994 and  1993,  respectively.  The  percent  of
increase from the prior year for net earnings,  excluding restructuring charges,
was 5.1%, and 19.3% for 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Net sales
The 1996 Company net sales increase of 7.9% was primarily  volume related.  This
increase  was  affected by 1996 having two more sales days than 1995 (on a daily
basis,  net  sales  increased  7.1%).  Excluding  the  incremental  net sales of
Acklands - Grainger Inc. (AGI), the Canadian  industrial  distribution  business
acquired on December 2, 1996, net sales  increased 7.2% (6.4% on a daily basis).
This  increase  primarily  represented  the  effects  of  the  Company's  market
initiatives which included new product  additions,  the continuing  expansion of
store  facilities,  the addition of Zone  Distribution  Centers (ZDCs),  and the
National Accounts,  Integrated Supply, and Direct Marketing programs.  Partially
offsetting  the growth from these  initiatives  were two factors.  First quarter
1996 net sales for the Company's Grainger  store-based  business were negatively
affected by the sluggish economy and adverse weather  experienced by much of the
East Coast  during  January.  The second  factor was that net sales of  seasonal
products within the Grainger store-based business declined  approximately 18% in
the 1996 third  quarter as compared  with the same 1995 period.  Many regions of
the country experienced milder weather in July and August of 1996 as compared to
the same periods in 1995.  This  contributed  to a full year decline in seasonal
product sales estimated at 1%.

The Grainger  store-based  business experienced selling price increases of about
1.9% when comparing 1996 with 1995. The Grainger store-based  business' National
Accounts program showed strong growth for the year, with net sales increasing to
approximately $849,000,000.  Daily net sales to these National Account customers
increased about 20%, on a comparable  basis, over 1995. All geographic areas for
the Grainger  store-based  business  contributed  to the sales growth,  with the
percent increases for regions west of the Mississippi being slightly higher than
for the regions in the east.

The 1995 Company net sales increase of 8.4% was primarily  volume related.  This
increase  was  affected  by 1995 having one less sales day than 1994 (on a daily
basis, net sales increased 8.8%). The volume increase can be explained primarily
by the Company's market initiatives and the growth in the national economy.  The
Company's market initiatives  included new product  additions,  the expansion of
store  facilities,  adding Zone  Distribution  Centers (ZDCs),  and the National
Accounts program.

The Grainger  store-based  business experienced selling price increases of about
1.5% when comparing 1995 with 1994. The Grainger store-based  business' National
Accounts program showed strong growth for the year, with net sales increasing to
approximately $668,000,000.  Daily net sales to these National Account customers
increased about 22%, on a comparable  basis, over 1994. All geographic areas for
the Grainger  store-based business contributed to the net sales growth, with the
percent increases for regions east of the Mississippi being slightly higher than
for regions in the west.



                                      (10)


Net earnings
Net  earnings for 1996  increased  11.7% over 1995.  This  increase for 1996 was
higher  than  the  net  sales  increase  primarily  due  to  operating  expenses
increasing at a slower rate than net sales,  higher interest  income,  and lower
interest  expense,  partially offset by lower gross profit margins.  The rate of
growth in operating expenses was lower than the net sales increase primarily due
to payroll and  employee  benefits  costs  increasing  at a slower rate than net
sales and lower  freight-out  expenses.  Partially  offsetting the above factors
were data processing expenses,  advertising  expenses,  and expenses relating to
marketing initiatives and business process improvement programs,  all increasing
faster than net sales,  and December 1996 incremental  expenses  associated with
AGI. The increase in interest income resulted from higher average daily invested
balances,  partially offset by lower average interest rates earned. The decrease
in interest  expense  resulted from lower average  borrowings and lower interest
rates  paid on all  outstanding  debt,  partially  offset  by lower  capitalized
interest.   Partially   offsetting  these  decreases  in  interest  expense  was
incremental  interest  expense  attributable  to $132,874,000 in short-term debt
added in December 1996 relating to the  acquisition of AGI. The Company's  gross
profit margin  decreased by 0.22 percentage  point when comparing the full years
of 1996 and 1995.  This decrease was  principally  the result of an  unfavorable
change in selling price category mix, which  primarily  resulted from the growth
in sales to the  Company's  larger volume  customers.  The addition of AGI had a
minor  effect on this  decrease.  Partially  offsetting  the above  factors were
selling price  increases  exceeding the level of cost  increases and a favorable
change in the product mix as sales of seasonal products declined.  Historically,
the sales of seasonal products have lower than average gross profit margins.

Net  earnings  for 1995  increased  46.0%  over 1994  including  the  effects of
after-tax  restructuring  charges of $49,779,000 recorded in 1994. Excluding the
effect of these  restructuring  charges,  net earnings  increased 5.1% year over
year. This increase was less than the sales increase  primarily due to operating
expenses  increasing  at a faster rate than net sales offset by slightly  higher
gross profit margins.  Operating  expenses increased faster than sales primarily
due to the Company's continuing investment in the business infrastructure needed
to support  its market  initiatives,  increased  employee  benefits  costs,  and
increased  freight-out  expenses.  Increased  freight-out expenses resulted from
proportionally more shipments  qualifying for prepaid freight and proportionally
more orders  being  transferred  within the Zone  Distribution  facilities/store
network. This partially resulted in orders being shipped longer distances. These
incremental  expenses,  by  policy,  were not  billed  to  customers.  Partially
offsetting  these  increases  were  lower  bad  debt  expenses;   payroll  costs
increasing  somewhat  slower  than  the  rate of  sales  growth;  and  decreased
amortization  of goodwill and other  acquisition  related costs  associated with
acquired and start-up businesses. The Company's gross profit margin increased by
0.06 percentage point when comparing the full years of 1995 and 1994,  excluding
the effects of a restructuring  charge of $16,308,000  (0.54 percentage point of
gross profit)  associated  with inventory  write-downs  taken during 1994.  This
slight increase was principally  related to a favorable  product mix as sales of
non-seasonal products grew at a higher rate than the sales of seasonal products.
The sales of seasonal  products have  historically  had lower than average gross
profit margins.  Partially  offsetting the favorable  impacts was an unfavorable
change in selling price category mix, which  primarily  resulted from the growth
in sales to National Accounts.

The company  repurchased 409,600 shares of its common stock in 1996. The Company
did not  repurchase  any shares of common stock during 1995 or 1994. At December
31, 1996,  approximately 3,200,000 shares of common stock remained available for
repurchase  under the existing  authorization.  At March 7, 1997,  approximately
2,000,000 shares of common stock remained available for repurchase.



                                      (11)


Dividends paid to shareholders  were  $50,035,000 in 1996,  $45,227,000 in 1995,
and $39,570,000 in 1994.

On December 2, 1996,  the Company  acquired AGI for  approximately  $289,334,000
including  transaction  expenses.  The purchase  consisted of cash  payments and
transaction  expenses of $136,801,000  (funded principally by short-term debt of
$132,874,000),  and the  issuance of  2,039,886  shares of W.W.  Grainger,  Inc.
common stock valued at $152,533,000.

Internally  generated  funds have been the primary source of working capital and
funds needed for expanding the business (including capital expenditures relating
to the facilities  optimization program),  supplemented by debt as circumstances
dictated.  In  addition  to  continuing  facilities   optimization  efforts  and
infrastructure  development  to  support  current  initiatives,  long-term  cash
requirements are anticipated for the  consolidation  of Chicago-area  offices in
the office facility  currently being constructed in Lake Forest,  Illinois.  The
Company had no material financing commitments outstanding at December 31, 1996.

The  Company  continues  to  maintain  a low debt  ratio  and  strong  liquidity
position,  which  provides  flexibility  in funding  working  capital  needs and
long-term cash  requirements.  In addition to internally  generated  funds,  the
Company has various sources of financing  available,  including commercial paper
sales and bank borrowings  under lines of credit and otherwise.  Total debt as a
percent of shareholders' equity was 11%, 5%, and 4%, at December 31, 1996, 1995,
and 1994, respectively.

                          INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Inflation  during  the last  three  years has not been a  significant  factor to
operations.  The  predominant  use of the last-in,  first-out  (LIFO)  method of
accounting for inventories and  accelerated  depreciation  methods for financial
reporting  and income tax purposes  result in a substantial  recognition  of the
effects of inflation in the primary financial statements.

The major impact of inflation is on buildings  and  improvements,  where the gap
between historic cost and replacement cost continues to be significant for these
long lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets
increases significantly when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation.

The Company believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the
interests  of  investors  lies  in  continued   application  of  basic  business
principles,  which include improving  productivity,  increasing  working capital
turnover,  and offering  products and  services  which can command  proper price
levels in the marketplace.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of
W.W. Grainger, Inc.

     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of W.W.
Grainger, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, and the
related  consolidated  statements of earnings,  shareholders'  equity,  and cash
flows  for  the  years  then  ended.   These   financial   statements   are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects,  the consolidated financial position of W.W. Grainger,
Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  1996,  1995,  and  1994,  and the
consolidated  results of their operations and their  consolidated cash flows for
the  years  then  ended,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted   accounting
principles.

     We have also audited  Schedule II of W.W.  Grainger,  Inc. and Subsidiaries
for the years ended  December 31, 1996,  1995,  and 1994.  In our opinion,  this
Schedule presents fairly, in all material respects,  the information required to
be set forth therein.

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from
the consolidated financial statements.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
In  preparing  financial   statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles,  management is required to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities,  the disclosure of
contingent  assets and liabilities,  and the estimates of revenues and expenses.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

ACCOUNTING CHANGE
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  (SFAS) No. 121,  "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets
and for  Long-Lived  Assets to be Disposed  Of." The effect of adopting this new
standard was immaterial.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company  recognizes  revenue at the date products are shipped or at the date
services are completed.

INVENTORIES
Inventories  are  valued  at the  lower of cost or  market.  Cost is  determined
primarily by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

PROPERTY, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT
Property, buildings, and equipment are valued at cost.

For financial statement purposes,  depreciation and amortization are provided in
amounts  sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable  assets to operations over
their  estimated  service  lives,   principally  on  the  declining-balance  and
sum-of-the-years-digits  methods.  The principal  estimated useful lives used in
determining depreciation are as follows:

Buildings, structures, and improvements..............             10 to 45 years
Furniture, fixtures, machinery, and equipment........              3 to 10 years

Improvements  to leased  property are  amortized  over the initial  terms of the
respective leases or the estimated service lives of the improvements,  whichever
is shorter.

The  Company  capitalized   interest  costs  of  $1,772,000,   $2,136,000,   and
$1,929,000, in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The  financial  statements of the Company's  foreign  subsidiaries  are measured
using the local currency as the functional currency.  Accordingly, the effect of
translating  these  subsidiary's  financial  statements  into  U.S.  dollars  is
recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity.

PURCHASED TAX BENEFITS
The Company  purchased tax benefits  through  leases as provided by the Economic
Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Realized tax benefits, net of repayments, are included
in Deferred Income Taxes.

INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the
determination of financial  statement income, with deferred taxes being provided
for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting.

                                      (24)


EARNINGS PER COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARE
Earnings  per common and common  equivalent  share are  computed  based upon the
weighted  average number of shares  outstanding  during each year which includes
outstanding options for common stock, when dilutive.

NOTE 2--BUSINESS ACQUISITION

Effective  December 2, 1996, the Company  purchased the stock of a subsidiary of
Acklands Limited (a Canadian corporation).  The business acquired is the largest
nationwide  distributor  of  broad  line  industrial  supplies  in  Canada.  The
aggregate purchase price was approximately  $289,334,000  including  transaction
expenses.  The purchase  consisted of cash payments and transaction  expenses of
$136,801,000  (funded  principally by short-term debt of  $132,874,000)  and the
issuance of  2,039,886  shares of W.W.  Grainger,  Inc.  common  stock valued at
$152,533,000.  The  acquisition  is  being  accounted  for  as a  purchase,  and
accordingly,  the financial  statements  include  results of operations from the
date of acquisition. The purchase included intangibles, including trademarks and
goodwill,  valued at  $173,420,000 to be amortized over periods of five to forty
years.

The  following  unaudited  pro forma  summary  presents the combined  results of
operations of the Company and the acquired  business,  as if the acquisition had
occurred at the beginning of 1995.  The pro forma amounts give effect to certain
adjustments,   including  the  amortization  of  intangibles,  foreign  currency
translation,  increased interest expense and income tax effects.  This pro forma
summary does not  necessarily  reflect the results of  operations  as they would
have been if the businesses had  constituted a single entity during such periods
and is not  necessarily  indicative  of  results  which may be  obtained  in the
future.

NOTE 3--RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

The Company  announced in July 1994 its intention to integrate its Allied Safety
(safety products) and Bossert Industrial Supply (production consumable products)
units. In conjunction  with the integration of these business units, the Company
also began the process of consolidating its financial, information services, and
human resource functions.  In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a
$67,097,000  pretax  charge  ($48,398,000  or 94 cents per share on an after-tax
basis) to recognize the expected costs associated with the above efforts.  Total
restructuring charges were (in thousands of dollars except per share amounts):

restructuring charges were not material.

NOTE 4--CASH FLOWS

The Company considers  investments in highly liquid debt instruments,  purchased
with an original  maturity of ninety days or less, to be cash  equivalents.  For
cash  equivalents the carrying amount  approximates  fair value due to the short
maturity of these instruments.

Cash paid during the year for:

NOTE 5--CASH

Checks outstanding of $35,366,000, $40,027,000, and $37,088,000, are included in
Trade accounts payable at December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. These
amounts are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 6--CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company places temporary cash  investments with  institutions of high credit
quality  and,  by  policy,  limits  the  amount  of credit  exposure  to any one
institution.

The Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries doing
business  in all  regions of the United  States as well as other  areas of North
America.  Consequently, in management's opinion, no significant concentration of
credit risk exists for the Company.

NOTE 7--INVENTORIES

Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale.

Inventories would have been $209,305,000,  $194,854,000, and $184,364,000 higher
than  reported  at December  31,  1996,  1995,  and 1994,  respectively,  if the
first-in,  first-out (FIFO) method of inventory accounting had been used for all
Company inventories. Inventories under FIFO approximate replacement cost.

NOTE 8--OTHER ASSETS

Included in other assets are  intangibles  such as customer  lists and goodwill.
Customer  lists are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over periods of five to
sixteen years.  Goodwill represents the cost in excess of net assets of acquired
companies  and is  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over periods of five to
forty  years.  Other  assets  increased  in 1996  primarily  due to the business
acquisition described in Note 2.

On December 2, 1996, in connection  with the business  acquisition  described in
Note 2, the acquired Canadian  subsidiary issued six month banker's  acceptances
with a face value of $134,947,000, denominated in Canadian dollars. The banker's
acceptances were issued at a discount,  with an effective interest rate of 3.13%
which  yielded  proceeds of  $132,874,000.  In  addition,  this  subsidiary  has
established  a working  capital line of credit of  $36,483,000.  At December 31,
1996,  borrowings under the working capital line of credit were $2,518,000.  The
Company has guaranteed these borrowings.

The Company also had available  lines of credit of  $150,000,000 at December 31,
1996,  $54,500,000 at December 31, 1995,  and  $54,000,000 at December 31, 1994.
The total  available  at December  31,  1996 was in place to support  commercial
paper, and carried commitment fees of 0.07%.

NOTE 10--EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

RETIREMENT  PLANS.  A  majority  of the  Company's  employees  are  covered by a
noncontributory  profit  sharing plan.  This plan  provides for annual  employer
contributions  based upon a formula primarily related to earnings before federal
income  taxes,  limited to 15% of the total  compensation  paid to all  eligible
employees.  The Company  also  sponsors  additional  profit  sharing and defined
benefit  plans which  cover most of the other  employees.  Provisions  under all
plans  were  $49,450,000,  $47,323,000,  and  $46,117,000  for the  years  ended
December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT  BENEFITS.  The Company has a health care  benefits plan covering
most of its retired employees and their dependents.  A majority of the Company's
employees  become  eligible for these  benefits when they qualify for retirement
while working for the Company.

The  amount  charged  to  operating  expense  for  postretirement  benefits  was
$3,578,000,  $3,488,000,  and  $3,153,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996,
1995, and 1994, respectively. Components of the expense were:

Participation  in the plan is voluntary at retirement and requires  participants
to make  contributions,  as  determined  by the Company,  toward the cost of the
plan.  The  accounting  for the  health and  benefits  plan  anticipates  future
cost-sharing  changes to retiree  contributions  that will  maintain the current
cost-sharing  ratio between the Company and the retirees.  A Group Benefit Trust
has been established as the vehicle to process benefit  payments.  The assets of
the trust are  invested  in a  Standard  & Poor's 500 index  fund.  The  assumed
weighted  average  long-term rate of return is 6.7%, which is net of a 36.5% tax
rate.

The funding of the trust is an  estimated  amount which is intended to allow the
maximum  deductible  contribution  under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as
amended, and was $379,000, $2,409,000, and $737,000 for the years ended December
31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

A reconciliation  of funded status as of December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994 is as

To  determine  the APBO as of December 31, 1996 and 1995,  the assumed  weighted
average  discount  rate used was 7.5%.  To determine the APBO as of December 31,
1994, the assumed  weighted  average  discount rate was 8.5%. The assumed health
care cost trend rate for 1997  through 1998 was 10.0%.  Beginning  in 1999,  the
assumed  health  care cost trend rate  declines on a  straight-line  basis until
2008, when the ultimate trend rate of 5.6% will be achieved.

If the assumed health care cost trend rate was increased by one percentage point
for each year,  the APBO as of December 31, 1996 would  increase by  $7,184,000.
The aggregate of the service cost and interest  cost  components of the 1996 net
periodic postretirement benefits expense would increase by $1,137,000.

The  industrial  development  revenue  bonds  include  various  issues that bear
interest at a variable  rate up to 15%,  or  variable  rates up to 78.20% of the
prime rate,  and come due in various  amounts from 2001 through  2021.  Interest
rates on some of the  issues  are  subject  to  change at  certain  dates in the
future.  The  bondholders  may  require  the  Company  to redeem  certain  bonds
concurrent with a change in interest rates and certain other bonds annually.  In
addition,  $13,545,000  of  these  bonds  had an  unsecured  liquidity  facility
available at December 31, 1996 for which the Company  compensated a bank through
a commitment fee of 0.07%.  There were no borrowings related to this facility at

NOTE 13--STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

The Company's  Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan ("The Plan") allows the Company to
grant a variety of incentive  awards to key employees of the Company.  A maximum
of 4,028,414  shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the Plan,
in connection with awards of  non-qualified  stock options,  stock  appreciation
rights, restricted stock, phantom stock rights, and other stock-based awards.



                                      (29)


The Plan  authorizes  the  granting  of  restricted  stock  which is held by the
Company  until  certain  terms and  conditions  as  specified by the Company are
satisfied.  Except for the right of disposal,  holders of restricted  stock have
full  shareholders'  rights during the period of restriction,  including  voting
rights and the right to receive dividends.

The Plan authorizes the granting of options to purchase shares at a price of not
less than 85% of the closing  market price on the last trading day preceding the
date of grant.  The options expire within ten years after the date of grant. The
Plan also permits the granting of stock appreciation rights,  either alone or in
tandem with  options  already  granted  and to be granted in the  future.  Stock
appreciation  rights permit the holder to receive stock,  cash, or a combination
thereof,  equal to the  amount  by which  the fair  market  value on the date of
exercise exceeds the option price.

Exercise of a stock option or a stock appreciation right  automatically  cancels
any respective tandem stock appreciation right or stock option.

Shares  covered  by  terminated,   surrendered  or  canceled  options  or  stock
appreciation rights that are unexercised,  by forfeited  restricted stock, or by
the  forfeiture of other awards that do not result in shares being  issued,  are
again available for awards under the Plan.

There were 235,000 shares of restricted  stock issued in 1996 with a fair market
value of $76 per share.  The  shares are  scheduled  to vest in  November  2006,
although  accelerated  vesting is provided in certain  instances.  There were no
shares of restricted  stock issued in 1995 or 1994.  Restricted  stock  released
totaled 1,000,  1,050,  and 4,615 shares in 1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectively.
There  were  650  shares  canceled  in 1994.  Compensation  expense  related  to
restricted  stock  awards  is based  upon  market  price at date of grant and is
charged to earnings  on a  straight-line  basis over the period of  restriction.
Total compensation  expense for stock-based  compensation was $282,000,  $42,000
and $96,000 in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

There was no activity  relating to stock  appreciation  rights in 1996, 1995, or
1994,  and at  December  31,  1996,  there  were no  stock  appreciation  rights
outstanding.

Transactions involving stock options are summarized as follows:

NOTE 14--ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

The Company adopted a Shareholder  Rights Plan, under which there is outstanding
one preferred  share  purchase right (Right) for each  outstanding  share of the
Company's  common  stock.  Each  Right,  under  certain  circumstances,  may  be
exercised  to  purchase  one  two-hundredth  of  a  share  of  Series  A  Junior
Participating  Preferred  Stock  (intended to be the economic  equivalent of one
share of the Company's common stock) at a price of $125,  subject to adjustment.
The  Rights  become  exercisable  only  after a person or a group,  other than a
person or group exempt under the plan,  acquires or announces a tender offer for
20% or more of the Company's  common stock.  If a person or group,  other than a
person or group  exempt under the plan,  acquires  20% or more of the  Company's
common  stock  or if the  Company  is  acquired  in a merger  or other  business
combination  transaction,  each Right generally entitles the holder,  other than
such person or group, to purchase,  at the  then-current  exercise price,  stock
and/or other securities or assets of the Company or the acquiring company having
a market value of twice the exercise price.

The Rights expire on May 15, 1999 unless  earlier  redeemed.  They generally are
redeemable  at $.01 per Right until thirty days  following  announcement  that a
person  or  group,  other  than a person or group  exempt  under  the plan,  has
acquired 20% or more of the Company's common stock. They are also  automatically
redeemable,  at the redemption price, upon consummation of certain  transactions
approved by shareholders in accordance with procedures provided in the plan. The
Rights do not have voting or dividend rights and, until they become exercisable,
have no dilutive effect on the earnings of the Company.

NOTE 15--INCOME TAXES

The asset and liability approach of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial bases and
