                                  PART I	 
Item 1: Business	
The Company	
The registrant, W.W. Grainger, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Illinois	
in 1928. It is a nationwide distributor of equipment, components, and supplies
to the commercial, industrial, contractor, and institutional markets and regards
itself as a service business. As used herein, "Company" means W.W. Grainger,	
Inc. and/or its subsidiaries as the context may require.	

The Company's Corporate headquarters are located in Skokie, Illinois. Corporate	
management has responsibility for overall organization, planning, business	
development, and control of Company activities and provides specific	
coordination and guidance in the areas of Accounting, Administrative Services,	
Aviation, Communications, Compensation and Benefits, Data Systems and Data	
Processing, Finance, Government Regulations, Human Resources, Industrial	
Relations, Insurance and Risk Management, Internal Audit, Legal, Planning,	
Real Estate and Construction Services, Security and Safety, Taxes, Training 	
and Development, and Treasury Services.	

Data processing equipment is used extensively for inventory control, order	
processing, branch inventory replenishment, requirements planning, invoicing,	
accounts receivable, and numerous other accounting and management purposes.	
During 1993, an average of 77,800 sales transactions were completed daily.	

The Company utilizes a satellite communications network which substantially	
reduces its reliance on phone lines by	linking branches and other facilities
together via a network control center. This results in the instantaneous  	
transmittal of information, which expedites the completion of sales	
transactions and stock replenishment.	

The Company does not engage in basic or substantive product research and	
development activity. New items are added regularly to its product line
on the basis of market research as well as recommendations of its employees,
customers, and	suppliers. Before being added, a new item must satisfy many
evaluation tests and other rigid requirements.
	
Grainger Division
The Company's Grainger Division is a nationwide distributor of air compressors,
air conditioning and refrigeration equipment and components, air tools and
paint spraying equipment, blowers, communication equipment, electric motors,
fans, gearmotors, heating equipment and controls, hydraulic equipment,
janitorial supplies, lighting fixtures and components, liquid pumps, material
handling and storage equipment, motor controls, office equipment, outdoor
equipment, plant and office maintenance equipment, power and hand tools,
power generating plants, power transmission components, safety products, and
shop tools, as well as other items shown in its General Catalog.

The Grainger Division sells principally to contractors, service shops,
industrial and commercial maintenance departments, manufacturers, hotels, and
health care and educational facilities. Sales in 1993 represented approximately
17,400,000 transactions averaging $127 each and were made to more than 1,200,000
customers. Average 1993 purchases per customer approximated $1,886, although
average 1993 purchases per National Accounts customer were significantly higher.
Sales to the largest single customer, the United States Postal Service, were
0.4% of sales. The Grainger Division estimates that approximately 32% of 1993
sales consisted of items bearing the Company's registered trademarks: "DAYTON"
(principally  electric motors, fans, heaters, and lighting); "DEMCO" (power
transmission belts); "DEM-KOTE" (spray paints); "SPEEDAIRE" (air compressors);
and "TEEL" (liquid pumps). The Company has taken steps to protect these
trademarks against infringement and believes that they will remain available
for future use in its business. Sales of remaining items consisted of other well
recognized brands.

The Grainger Division purchases from more than 1,200 product suppliers most of
which are manufacturers. The largest supplier in 1993, a diversified 
manufacturer, through 26 of its divisions, accounted for 13.0% of purchases.
No material difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply. 

The Grainger Division offers its line of products at competitive prices through
a nationwide network of branches (337 at December 31, 1993). An average branch
has 13 employees and handles about 200 transactions per day. Large,

computer controlled stocks of over 53,000 items maintained at three Regional
Distribution Centers, located in the Chicago area, Greenville County, South
Carolina, and Kansas City, Missouri, provide the branches and customers with
protection against variable demand and delayed factory deliveries. Each branch
tailors its inventory to local customer preferences and actual product demand.
In 1993, the Grainger Division invested more than $60,000,000 in branch
expansion, which consisted of new branches, relocated branches, and additions
to branches.

To provide faster replenishment for local branches and to create greater scale
in shipping, the Grainger Division launched a new logistics strategy in 1993.
Zone Distribution Centers (ZDCs), a new level in the distribution system, are
approximately 200,000 square feet, or roughly ten times the size of a typical 
branch. ZDCs "breakbulk" daily shipments from their respective Regional
Distribution Centers for local branch replenishment, and handle shipped orders
for their zone. ZDCs are also capable of filling almost all local branch will
call customer backorders within 24 hours.

The Grainger Division National Accounts Program addresses the needs of large
multisite companies by focusing on simplifying customers' plant maintenance,
repair, and operation (MRO) purchasing activities and providing consistent
service and pricing at each customer location. Sales to National Accounts
increased 25% in 1993 over the prior year, and National Accounts relationships
have been established with over 300 of the nation's largest companies.

During 1993, the Company created Grainger Sanitary Supplies and Equipment.
This was accomplished by combining elements of its two regional sanitary
supply distributors, Jani-Serv and Ball Industries (Ball), with the Grainger
Division's line of professional cleaning products. This new structure is
intended to preserve Jani-Serv's and Ball's market expertise and penetration, 
and to leverage upon the Company's existing investments in product line, sales,
distribution, warehousing, and management information systems. Ball continues as
the Company's cleaning chemical mixing operation, and, during 1993, its 
capacity was tripled. Ball now produces a full line of floor and carpet care
products under the Ball brand name. These replace Jani-Serv private label
products, and are the first Ball products to be distributed nationwide.

The Grainger Division employs sales representatives who call on existing and
prospective customers. Sales representatives are paid a salary and commission.
In addition, a sales force of market specialists and national account
specialists has been developed to serve individualized markets and National
Accounts. These specialists are paid a salary only. The Grainger Division
employed 1,081 sales representatives, market specialists, and national account
specialists at December 31, 1993.

An important selling tool is the General Catalog, which has been published
continuously since 1927 and has grown to 2,952 pages listing over 53,000 items
together with extensive technical and application data. Two separate editions,
totaling 2,811,000 copies, were published during 1993. The most current edition
was issued in January 1994.

In response to requests from several large, multisite customers to expand
product offerings, the Grainger Division now handles an additional 20,000 
non-catalog items, which include full lines of products from key suppliers.

The Grainger Electronic Catalog brings directly to the customer's place of
business a fast, easy way to select and order products. It is a state-of-the- 
art system that uses PC-based software and CD-ROM technology. Through the
Electronic Catalog, the customer can use a variety of ways to describe a 
needed product, and then review Grainger's offerings, complete with 
specifications, prices, and pictures. Other Electronic Catalog features include
a cross-reference function that allows customers to retrieve product
information using their own stock numbers. Enhancements for 1993 included
a selection guide which responds to customer inquiries about motors, casters,
and light bulbs and automatically identifies those items that meet the
customer's specifications, and an order pad function which permits customers
to browse and check their orders. More than 13,000 copies of the Electronic 
Catalog are currently in use. The Electronic Catalog is also used at the
branches as a training tool and a resource for identifying appropriate products
for customers' applications.


Allied Safety, Inc. (Allied), Bossert Industrial Supply, Inc. (Bossert), Lab
Safety Supply, Inc. (Lab Safety), and Parts Company of America (PCA)

Since 1989, the Company has been building other distribution businesses
intended to complement the market position held by the Grainger Division. 
Developed through acquisitions and internal expansion, these businesses have
made the Company an active participant in three key markets: safety products,
general industrial supplies, and repair and replacement parts. As with the
development of Grainger Sanitary Supplies and Equipment, similar collaborative

efforts between the Grainger Division and these businesses are being
evaluated. Initial programs begun in 1993 will be reviewed and expanded as
appropriate in future years.

Allied and Lab Safety serve the safety products markets with such items as
respiratory systems, protective clothing, and other equipment used in the
workplace and in environmental clean-up operations. Allied was formed by
combining three acquired regional safety businesses in the Southeast and 
Northwest. Allied began a national expansion program during 1993 by extending
its sales activities to Baton Rouge, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and
Philadelphia. Allied intends to use the Grainger Division's ZDCs to support its
national expansion. Lab Safety, acquired in 1992, is a leading national direct
marketer of safety products, and is the largest catalog safety supply
distributor in the United States, serving 340,000 customers from its facilities
in Janesville, Wisconsin. The Lab Safety General Catalog, its primary selling
selling tool, has over 900 pages, listing approximately 26,000 items. 

Bossert is the Midwest leader in general industrial supplies distribution, with
19 locations serving more than 35,000 customers in 14 states. Built through
a series of acquisitions, Bossert provides cutting tools and abrasives, MRO
products, and other supplies used in manufacturing processes. Bossert
distributes more than 250,000 items. In 1993, Bossert and the Grainger Division
combined efforts for several team selling approaches to large customers, taking
advantage of the trend of these businesses toward consolidation of suppliers. By
presenting their combined product offerings, both businesses' value added
packages were increased. The potential of further joint efforts will continue
to be evaluated.

Parts distribution continues to expand under the PCA name. PCA distributes
approximately 110,000 repair and replacement parts, takes orders 24 hours a
day, 365 days per year, and ships stocked items within 24 hours of an order,
most on the same business day. PCA offers value to both suppliers and customers.
By developing "partnerships" with small and medium manufacturers, PCA assumes 
complete responsibility for purchasing, stocking, and managing the supplier's
parts inventory. PCA gives value to customers by being a single source for many
different repair and replacement parts and by offering valuable technical
assistance.

Industry Segments
The Company has concluded that its business is within a single industry
segment. For information as to the Company's consolidated revenue and operating
earnings see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and the Results of Operations," and Item 8, "Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data." The total assets of the Company for the last five years
were: 1993, $1,376,664,000; 1992, $1,310,538,000; 1991, $1,216,554,000; 1990,
$1,162,437,000; and 1989, $1,065,245,000.

Competition
The Company faces competition in all markets which it serves, principally from
manufacturers (including some of the Company's own suppliers) that sell directly
to certain segments of the market, from wholesale distributors, and from
certain retail enterprises.

The principal means by which the Company competes with manufacturers and other
distributors is by providing local stocks, efficient service, sales
representatives, competitive prices, and its several catalogs, which include
product descriptions and in certain cases, extensive technical and application
data. The Company believes that it can effectively compete on a price basis
with its larger manufacturing competitors on small orders, but that such
manufacturers may enjoy a cost advantage in filling large orders.

The Company serves a number of diverse markets, and is able in some markets to
reasonably estimate the Company's competitive position within that market.
However, taken as a whole the Company is unable to determine its market shares
relative to others engaged in whole or in part in similar activities.

Employees
As of December 31, 1993, the Company had 10,219 employees, of whom 8,550 were
full-time and 1,669 were part-time or temporary. Of the 10,219 employees, the
Company had 609 Corporate employees. The Grainger Division included 4,414
branch employees, 1,081 sales representatives, and 2,096 office and regional	
distribution center employees. There were 195 Allied employees, 202 Ball 	
employees, 468 Bossert employees, 172 Jani-Serv employees, 671 Lab employees,	
and 311

PCA employees. The Company has never had a major work stoppage and	
believes that its employee relations are good.	

Item 2: Properties	
As of December 31, 1993, the 337 Grainger Division branches total 7,065,000	
square feet, an increase of approximately 5.7% over 1992. This increase is a	
result of branch expansion discussed in Item 1. Most branches are located in	
or near major metropolitan areas, many in industrial parks. Branches range in 	
size from 5,800 to 58,000 square feet and average approximately 21,000 square	
feet. A typical owned branch is on one floor, is of masonry construction,	
consists primarily of warehouse space, contains an air conditioned office and
sales area, and has off the street parking for	customers and employees. The
Company considers that its properties are generally in good condition and well	
maintained, and are suitable and adequate to carry on the Company's business.			
The significant facilities of the Company are briefly described below:			
                                                                      Size in

(1) These facilities are both owned and leased with leases expiring between 1994
    and 1998. The owned facilities are not subject to any mortgages.

(2) Grainger Division branches consist of 235 owned and 102 leased properties.
    The owned facilities are not subject to any mortgages.

(3) Other facilities represent leased and owned general offices, distribution
    centers, and branches. The owned facilities are not subject to any
    mortgages.

Item 3: Legal Proceedings
There are pending various legal and administrative proceedings involving the
Company that are incidental to the business. It is not expected that the
outcome of any such proceeding will have a material adverse effect upon 
the Company's consolidated financial position.


Item 4: Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders		
No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth		
quarter of 1993.

Net sales
The 1993 Grainger Division net sales increase of 9.3% was comprised of a 7.4%
volume increase and a 1.8% price increase. All geographic regions contributed
to the sales growth, with the percent increase for regions east of the
Mississippi being higher than for regions in the west. The volume increase was
attributable to a combination of the Company's market initiatives, including
new product additions, the continuing effect of expanding branch facilities, and
the growth of the National Accounts Program, and the accelerated growth in the
national economy. The increase in sales at the Other Business Units of 22.5%
was the result of $54,800,000 in incremental sales from an acquired business
and a 6.7% increase at existing businesses. All of the Other Business Units
experienced sales increases except for Bossert, which had a slight sales
decrease. Assuming the acquisition was included in both periods, the other
Business Units' pro forma sales would have increased by 7.9%.

The 1992 Grainger Division net sales increase of 8.6% was comprised of a 6.3%
volume increase and a 2.2% price increase. All geographic regions contributed
to the sales growth, with the percent increase for regions east of the
Mississippi being higher than for the regions in the west. The volume increase
primarily represents the effects of new product additions, the continuing
expansion of branch facilities, and the effect of the National Accounts Program.
In part, the price increase was intended to pass through supplier price
increases and to offset costs associated with the elimination of a per order
handling charge. The increase in sales for the year at the Other Business Units
of 61.5% was primarily the result of $131,268,000 in incremental sales from
acquired businesses. All of the Other Business Units, except Bossert, had a
sales increase. Assuming all acquisitions were included in both periods, the
Other Business Units' pro forma sales would have increased 5.4%. Other
Business Units' sales in 1992 were adversely affected by the termination of a
distribution arrangement by a supplier to Bossert of industrial abrasive
products which had accounted for approximately 14% of Bossert's sales.

Net earnings
The 1993 percentage increase was less than the increase in net sales primarily
due to operating expenses increasing faster than sales and an increase in the
effective income tax rate, partially offset by improved gross margins. The
increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to increased costs
at the acquired and start-up businesses and increased expenses at the Grainger
Division. The increased costs at the acquired and start-up businesses
reflect increased amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related
costs principally due to the Lab Safety acquisition, increased advertising
costs, and the Company's continuing investment in these units. The increase
in expense at the Grainger Division was caused primarily by handling costs
increasing due to the elimination of a transaction handling charge to
customers on certain shipped sales and higher data processing expenses primarily
related to new system development, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.
The increase in the effective income tax rate is due to the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993, which increased the maximum corporate federal
tax rate from 34% to 35% retroactive to January 1, 1993. Costs associated with
the creation of Grainger Sanitary Supplies and Equipment were not material. Any
future costs relative to the continuing development of Grainger Sanitary
Supplies and Equipment or any other collaborative efforts between the Grainger
Division and the other distribution businesses cannot be determined. The
Company's gross margin increase was attributable to improvements at both the
Grainger Division and at the Other Business Units. The improvement at the
Grainger Division was due to a favorable selling price category mix and a
favorable product mix partially offset by an unfavorable margin impact due to
the level of cost increases exceeding the level of price increases. The
improvement at the Other Business Units was primarily related to Lab Safety,
which had a higher gross margin than the average for the rest of the Other
Business Units and was included for all of 1993 versus eight months of 1992.

The 1992 percentage increase was less than the increase in net sales because of
operating expenses increasing at a higher rate than sales and decreased other
income, partially offset by improved gross profit margin. The increase in
operating expenses was caused primarily by increased costs associated with
acquired and start-up businesses and increased expenses at the Grainger
Division. The increased costs at acquired and start-up businesses, including
Jani-Serv, reflect increased amortization of goodwill and other acquisition
related costs due principally to the Lab Safety acquisition, the effect of
Lab Safety whose

operating expenses as a percent of sales were higher than the average for
the rest of the Company, and the Company's continuing investment in these
business units. The increase in expense at the Grainger Division was caused
primarily by higher payroll and benefits costs, advertising expenses related to
increased catalog costs caused by product additions, data processing expenses
associated with systems development, increased insurance expense, and
professional services related to marketing analysis. The Company increase in
gross margin primarily reflects improvement at the Grainger Division caused 
principally by price increases and by a decrease in sales of seasonal products
which have lower margins than average, and by the addition of Lab Safety sales
which have a higher gross margin than the average for the rest of the Company.
Other income decreased due to lower interest income and higher interest expense.
The Company used both its marketable securities portfolio and short-term
borrowings during the second quarter to finance the acquisition of Lab Safety.


FINANCIAL CONDITION			
Working Capital was $442,525,000 at December 31, 1993 compared to $478,784,000
at December 31, 1992 and $574,046,000 at December 31, 1991. The ratio of current
assets to current liabilities was 2.2, 2.5, and 3.0, at such dates.
Net cash flows from operations of $162,498,000 in 1993, $196,368,000 in 1992,
and $150,577,000 in 1991 have continued to improve the Company's financial
position and serve as the primary source of funding for capital requirements.
In each of the past three years, a portion of working capital has been used for
additions to property, buildings and equipment as summarized in the following
table.			

                                                 1993       1992       1991

                                                =======    =======    =======

The Company repurchased 1,777,000 shares of its common stock in 1993, 733,000
shares in 1992, and 1,354,000 shares in 1991. At December 31, 1993,
approximately 3,600,000 shares of common stock remained available under the
existing repurchase authorization.

Dividends paid to shareholders were $36,272,000 in 1993, $34,295,000 in 1992,
and $32,702,000 in 1991.

Through acquisition and expansion the Company continues to develop other
businesses. In 1992, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets of Lab
Safety Supply, Inc. for	$161,343,000. The acquisition was funded by short-term
borrowings of $72,727,000, including bank borrowings aggregating $36,727,000,
internal funds of the Company, and the assumption of $8,227,000 of long-term 
debt. Also during 1992, the Company completed its acquisition of Rice Safety
Equipment Company for $5,906,000. In 1991, Ball was acquired for $31,529,000 to
further expand the Company's sanitary supply business.

Long-term cash requirements, other than normal operating expenses, are
anticipated for ongoing Grainger Division branch expansion, continued expansion
of the Other Business Units, long-term debt repayments, and the payment of
dividends. In addition, relocation of existing owned and leased facilities to
newly purchased or constructed facilities is planned. The Company's ongoing
profitability continues to support these requirements. Internally generated
funds are the primary source for working capital and expansion needs,
supplemented by short-term borrowings as the need arises. At December 31, 1993,
the Company had short-term borrowings of $34,298,000. The Company had no
material individual commitments outstanding at December 31, 1992.

The Company continues to maintain a low debt ratio and a strong liquidity
position, which provide flexibility in funding working capital needs and
long-term cash requirements. Total debt as a percent of total shareholders'
equity was 7%, 3%, and 4% at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.


INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES
Inflation during the last three years has not been a significant factor to
operations. The use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for
inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and
income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of
inflation in the primary financial statements.

The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap
between historic cost and replacement cost continues to be significant for these
long lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets
increases significantly when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation.

The Company believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the
interests of investors lies in continued application of basic business
principles, which include improving productivity, increasing working capital
turnover, and offering products and services which command proper price levels
in the marketplace.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Shareholders and
 Board of Directors of
 W.W. Grainger, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of W.W. Grainger,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by	
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.	
 	
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of W.W. Grainger,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.	

We have also audited schedules V, VI, and VIII of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and
subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991. In our
opinion, these schedules present fairly, in all material respects, the
information required to be set forth therein.

W.W. Grainger, Inc. and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991
NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INDUSTRY INFORMATION
The Company is a nationwide distributor of equipment, components, and supplies
to the commercial, industrial, contractor, and institutional markets. The
Company operates within a single industry segment.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from
the consolidated financial statements.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES
Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (see Note 14) and SFAS
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions" (see Note 9). In the fourth quarter of 1993, retroactive to January 1,
1993, the Company adopted SFAS No.112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits" (see Note 9).



INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is primarily
determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

PROPERTY, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT
Property, buildings, and equipment are valued at cost. For financial statement
purposes, depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to
relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service
lives, principally on the declining-balance and sum-of-the-years-digits methods.
For income tax purposes, the Company uses the maximum allowable accelerated
methods.

Improvements to leased property are being amortized over the initial terms of
the respective leases or the estimated service lives of the improvements,
whichever is shorter. The Company capitalized interest costs of $1,258,000,
$1,110,000, and $1,381,000 in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

PURCHASED TAX BENEFITS
The Company has purchased tax benefits through leases as provided by the
Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Realized tax benefits, net of repayments,
are included in Deferred Income Taxes.

INCOME TAXES
The Company uses the maximum allowable accelerated depreciation methods.
Deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the temporary differences
between financial and tax reporting.

PURCHASE OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK
Through December 31, 1993, the Company was required by its state of
incorporation to retire any Common Stock it purchased. The excess of cost over
par value was charged proportionately to Additional contributed capital and
Retained earnings. Effective January 1, 1994, the Company is no longer required
by its state of incorporation to retire Common Stock repurchases.

EARNINGS PER COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARE
Earnings per common and common equivalent share are computed based upon the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year which includes
outstanding options for Common Stock, when dilutive.

NOTE 2-BUSINESS ACQUISITION
Effective May 1, 1992, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets and
business of Lab Safety Supply, Inc., a leading direct marketer and distributor
of safety products. The acquisition included cash payments of $161,343,000 and
the assumption of certain liabilities of Lab Safety Supply, Inc. including
$8,227,000 of long-term debt. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase.
Included in the purchase price was $121,367,000 which was allocated to
intangibles including customer list and goodwill, to be amortized over useful
lives of five to forty years. The acquisition was funded from internal sources
and the issuance of $72,727,000 of short-term debt.

The following unaudited pro forma summary combines the consolidated results of
operations of the Company and Lab Safety Supply, Inc. as if the acquisition
had occurred at the beginning of 1992 and 1991. The pro forma amounts give
effect to certain adjustments, including the amortization of intangibles, the
amortization of non-competition agreements, certain executive compensation,
increased interest expense, lost interest income, and income tax effects. This
pro forma summary does not necessarily reflect the results of operations as they
would have been if the companies had constituted a single entity during such
periods and is not necessarily indicative of results which may be obtained
in the future.

Earnings per common and common equivalent share       $2.55             $2.25



NOTE 3-CASH FLOWS			

The Company considers investments in highly liquid debt instruments, with an
original maturity of ninety days or less, to be cash equivalents. For cash
equivalents, the	carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short
maturity of those instruments.

Cash paid during the year for:				



                                           1993           1992         1991

                                         ========       =======       =======


NOTE 4-CASH				

Checks outstanding of $16,521,000, $23,713,000, and $12,288,000 are included in
Trade accounts payable at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.


NOTE 5-CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company places temporary cash investments with institutions of high credit
quality and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
institution. The Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse
industries doing business in all regions of the United States. Consequently, in
management's opinion, no significant concentration of credit risk exists
for the Company.

NOTE 6-INVENTORIES

Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale. Inventories
would have been $179,450,000, $168,363,000, and $158,429,000 higher than
reported at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively, if the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method of inventory accounting had been used.
	

NOTE 7-OTHER ASSETS				
Included in other assets are intangibles such as customer lists and goodwill.
Customer lists are	amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of five to
sixteen years. Goodwill represents the	cost in excess of net assets of acquired
companies and is amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years. Other
assets at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991 were:

additional 1/8% on that portion used to support actual commercial paper
outstanding.




NOTE 9-EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

RETIREMENT PLANS. A majority of the Company's employees are covered by a
noncontributory profit sharing plan. This plan provides for annual employer
contributions based upon a formula related primarily to earnings before federal
income taxes, limited to 15% of the total compensation paid to all eligible
employees. The Company also sponsors additional profit sharing and defined 
contribution plans which cover most other employees.

Provisions under all plans were $42,056,000, $37,289,000, and $31,610,000 for
the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.


POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. The Company has a health care benefits plan covering
most of its retired employees and their dependents. A majority of the Company's
employees become eligible for these benefits when they qualify for retirement
while working for the Company. On January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."
The statement  requires the Company to accrue the estimated  cost of providing
postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who
could become eligible for such benefits when they retire. Because the Company
had previously accrued postretirement benefits, the effect of adoption of
SFAS No. 106 was not material.


The amount charged to operating expense for postretirement was $2,600,000,
$2,000,000 and $3,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and
1991, respectively. Components of the 1993 expense were as follows (in thousands
of dollars):

    Service cost...............................................  $1,566
    Interest cost..............................................   1,553
    Actual return on assets....................................    (472)
    Amortization of transition asset (22 year amortization)....    (143)
    Deferred asset gain........................................      96
                                                                 ------
                                                                 $2,600
                                                                 ======
Participation in the plan is voluntary at retirement and requires participants
to make contributions, as determined by the Company, toward the cost of the
plan. The accounting for the health plan anticipates future cost-sharing changes
to retiree contributions that will maintain the current	cost-sharing ratio
between the Company and the retirees. A Group Benefit Trust has been	established
as the vehicle to process benefit payments. The assets of the trust are
invested in a Standard & Poor's 500 index fund. The weighted average long-term
rate of return is 6.6%, which is net of a 34.1% tax rate.			

The funding of the trust includes an estimated amount which is intended to allow
the maximum	deductible contribution under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and was $211,000, $1,579,000, and $443,000 for the years ended December
31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. A reconciliation of funded status as of
December 31, 1993 is as follows (in thousands of dollars): 

	   Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO):		
    Retirees and their dependents...............................$ (4,044)
    Fully eligible active plan participants.....................    (879)

    Accrued postretirement benefits costs.......................$(18,271)
                                                                =========
In determining the APBO, the assumed weighted average discount rate used was
7.3%. The assumed health care cost trend rate for 1994 through 1998 was 10.0%.
Beginning in 1999, the assumed health care cost trend rate declines on a
straight-line basis until 2008, when the ultimate trend rate of 5.6% will be
achieved.

If the assumed health care cost trend rate was increased by one percentage point
for each year, the APBO as of December 31, 1993 would increase by $5,032,000.
The aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 1993 net
periodic postretirement benefits expense would increase by $804,000.



POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. In the fourth quarter of 1993, retroactive to
January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employer's Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits." This statement requires the accrual of certain
benefits provided to former or inactive employees, after employment but before
retirement, if attributable to an employee's service already rendered. The
Company benefits accrued under SFAS No. 112 included long-term disability health
care benefits, short-term disability salary continuation benefits, and COBRA
benefits in excess of participant contributions. The cumulative effect at
January 1, 1993 of adopting SFAS No. 112 reduced net earnings by $4,033,000 or
8 cents per share. The effect of this change on 1993 net earnings before
the cumulative effect of accounting changes was not material.					


NOTE 10-LONG-TERM DEBT					

Long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31:					 

                                             1993       1992          1991

                                            =======    =======       =======


The industrial development revenue bonds include various issues that bear
interest at a fixed rate of 6.125%, a variable rate up to 15%, or variable
rates up to 80% of the prime rate. One of the bonds matures at the rate of
$75,000 each year through 1994, with the remaining bonds due in various amounts
from 2001 through 2011. Interest rates on some of the issues  are subject to			
change at certain dates in the future. The bondholders may require the Company
to redeem certain bonds concurrent with a change in interest rates, and
certain other bonds annually. At December 31, 1993, $26,150,000 of these bonds
were subject to these redemption options. Of these bonds, $4,895,000 are also
subject to agreements through 1995 between a bank and the Company which provide
that the bank will purchase any such bonds presented by the	bondholders and
hold them for a period of not less than one year. In addition, $12,045,000 of
these	bonds had an unsecured liquidity facility available at December 31, 1993
for which the Company compensated a bank through a commitment fee of 1/8%. There
were no borrowings related to	these facilities at December 31, 1993. The Company
classified $21,255,000, $20,555,000, and $18,330,000 of bonds currently subject
to redemption options in current maturities of long-term debt at December 31,
1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

The aggregate amounts of long-term debt maturing in each of the five years
subsequent to	December 31, 1993 are as follows:

1992, and 1991, respectively.			

NOTE 12-STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS	  		

The Company's Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan ("The Plan"), allows the Company
to grant a variety of incentive awards to key employees of the Company. These
awards involve the use of a	maximum of 4,028,414 shares of common stock, in
connection with awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, phantom stock rights and other stock based awards.			

The Plan authorizes the granting of restricted stock which is held by the
Company until certain terms and conditions as specified by the Company are
satisfied. Except for the right of disposal, holders of restricted stock have
full shareholders' rights during the period of restriction, including voting
rights and the right to receive dividends. Compensation expense related to
restricted stock awards is based upon market price at date of grant and is
charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the period of restriction.

The Plan authorizes the granting of options to purchase shares at a price of not
less than 85% of the closing market price on the last trading day preceding the
date of grant. The options expire within 10 years after the date of grant. The
Plan also permits the granting of stock appreciation rights, either alone or in
tandem with options already granted and to be granted in the future. The stock
appreciation rights permit the holder to receive stock, cash, or a combination
thereof, equal to the amount by which the fair market value on the date of
exercise exceeds the option price. Exercise of a stock option or a stock
appreciation right automatically cancels any respective tandem stock
appreciation right or stock option.

Shares covered by terminated, surrendered or cancelled options or stock
appreciation rights that are unexercised, but forfeited restricted stock, or by
the forfeiture of other awards that do not result in shares being issued, are
again available for awards under the Plan.



In 1993, 4,615 shares of restricted stock were released. In 1992, 4,615 shares
of stock were also released. There were 2,650 shares of restricted stock issued
in 1993, and there were 14,895 shares of restricted stock issued in 1991.

There was no activity relating to stock appreciation rights in 1993, 1992, or
1991, and at December 31, 1993, there were no stock appreciation rights
outstanding.

Transactions involving stock options are summarized as follows:

NOTE 13-ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

The Company has adopted a Shareholders Rights Plan and declared a dividend of
one preferred share purchase right (Right) for each outstanding share of the
Company's Common Stock. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase
from the Company one two-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share, at a price of $125.00 per one
two-hundredth of a Preferred share, subject to adjustment. The Rights would 
become exercisable only if a person or group (other than a person or group
exempt under the Plan) were to acquire 20% or more of the Company's Common Stock
or were to announce a tender offer, the consummation of which would result in
ownership of 20% or more of the Common Stock.

At any time prior to thirty days following the acquisition by a person or group
(other than a person or group exempt under the Plan) of beneficial ownership of
20% or more of the Company's Common Stock, the Rights are redeemable by the
Company for $.01 per Right (the redemption price). The Rights are also
redeemable automatically, at the redemption price, in connection with the
consummation of any tender offer at a cash price per share equal to or greater
than the price approved by shareholders at a special meeting which would be
called under certain circumstances in accordance with procedures contained in
the Rights Agreement.

The Rights do not have voting or dividend rights, and, until they become
exercisable, have no dilutive effect on the earnings of the Company.

The Rights will expire on May 15, 1999 unless earlier redeemed.


NOTE 14-INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." The cumulative effect of this accounting change was income of
$3,213,000 or 6 cents per share. The adoption of SFAS No. 109 changes the
Company's method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to an
asset and liability approach. Previously the Company deferred the tax effects of
timing differences between financial reporting income and taxable



income. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred
tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial bases and the	tax bases of assets and
liabilities. Income tax expense consisted of the following:

The purchased tax benefits represent lease agreements acquired in prior years

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the maximum corporate
federal tax	rate from 34% to 35% retroactive to January 1, 1993. The effect of
this rate change on the Company's deferred tax balances was not material.

The cumulative effect of accounting changes has been restated, as of January 1,
1993, for two items. The Company elected early adoption of SFAS No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which resulted in an after
tax charge of 8 cents per share. The	Company also recalculated the effect of
adopting SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"	restating the after tax
expense of 3 cents per share, by an after tax income amount of 9 cents per
share. The restated cumulative effect of accounting changes was a net after tax
expense of 2	cents per share.

                            Based on Improved Economic Earnings

INTRODUCTION

The Corporate Management Incentive Program (MIP) became effective January 1,
1993. For eligible participants, this program replaces former participation
in both the Team Achievement Bonus (TAB) and the now discontinued Long-Term
Incentive Program (LTIP).

PURPOSE

The Company has adopted Economic Earnings (EE) as a key financial measurement.
EE incorporates the attributes of growth, asset management, and earnings to
evaluate financial performance. Conceptually, long-term improvements in EE
should correspond to long-term improvements in shareholder value.

The MIP is designed to encourage decision making that results in improvement in
EE and to compensate executives appropriately for positive and negative 
performance resulting from business decisions. By linking EE to incentive
compensation, the MIP should influence managers to make business decisions
consistent with long-term shareholders' views.

ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION

Eligibility to participate in this program is limited to those who are most
responsible for profit decisions and/or major policy direction. For purposes
of eligibility, 2 groups have been identified as follows:
     1.   Office of the Chairman.
     2.   Corporate officers and key managers.

Participants must be in an eligible position by July 1.

ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN

The administration of the MIP is the responsibility of the Compensation
Committee of Management (CCOM), subject to the review and approval of the
Compensation Committee of the Board.

OVERVIEW

The MIP consists of 2 components: quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative
component is built around target bonuses. The target bonuses are stated as
a percentage of base salary. The target bonuses for Corporate officers and key
managers are divided into 2 parts: 75% of the target bonus is based on Company
EE and 25% is based on Corporate EE. The target bonus for the Office of the
Chairman is based solely on Company EE. The target bonuses are adjusted upward
or downward based on the relationship between actual Company EE and target


Company EE, and between actual Corporate EE and target Corporate EE, for each
year. These relationships are known as bonus multiples. The qualitative
component allows for a discretionary bonus. Any discretionary bonus begins as a
pool, and can be a positive or negative amount. Once the pool, if any, is 
determined, it is allocated pro rata across the group according to the
quantitative component earned by each participant.

The total bonus earned for each year will be added to a MIP account for each
participant. MIP accounts are not funded with actual cash amounts; they are a
Company liability for unpaid earned bonuses. The beginning account balance, if
any, will be adjusted annually by the percentage increase in the salary
structure for eligible employees.

For 1993, the bonus paid will be equal to the target bonus times the 1993 bonus
multiple, plus any discretionary bonus. For 1994, the bonus paid will be equal
to the target bonus times an average of the 1994 and the 1993 bonus multiples,
plus any discretionary bonus. For 1995 and later years, the bonus paid will
be equal to the target bonus times an average of that year's and the prior 
2 years' bonus multiples, plus any discretionary bonus. The only condition
imposed on these calculations is that payment of the bonus may not result in a
negative ending account balance.

For any given year, if a participant's performance rating falls below a 
minimum level, no bonus will be earned or paid for that year.

Bonus payments for a given year are generally made in the first quarter of the
following year.

TERMINATIONS AND CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT STATUS

The following shall apply to change of employment situations:

1. Death. The account balance immediately vests and, along with a pro rata award
   for the current year, is paid as a lump sum on the next regular incentive
   payment date.
2. Retirement or Long Term Disability. A pro rata award for the current year
   will be added to the participant account balance, and the employee will
   receive the account balance in a lump sum on the next regular incentive
   payment date. Retirement is defined the same as under the W.W. Grainger,
   Inc. Employees Profit-Sharing Plan.
3. Involuntary Termination. For "misconduct" means:
   The participant has engaged, or intends to engage, in competition with the
   Company, has induced any customer of the Company to breach any contract with
   the Company, has made any unauthorized disclosure of any of the secrets or
   confidential information of the Company, has committed an act of
   embezzlement, fraud, or theft with respect to the property of the Company,
   or has deliberately disregarded the rules of the Company in such a manner
   as to cause any loss, damage, or injury to, or otherwise endanger the
   property, reputation, or employees of the Company.


   In these instances, a participant's account balance will be forfeited and no
   award will be granted for the current or prior year.
4. Voluntary Resignation. If a participant leaves after July 1, but before the
   end of the calendar year, the employee will be deemed to have earned that
   year's bonus and will receive that year's payment on the next regular
   incentive payment date. The salary to be used in calculations will be the
   actual amount paid in the year rather than an annualized amount. Any
   remaining account balance will be forfeited.
5. Job Elimination or Downgrade. If a participant's job is eliminated or
   downgraded and the employee's new job is at a non-participating level, a 
   pro rata payment for the current year will be made on the next regular
   incentive payment date. The employee also will receive any remaining account
   balance on that date. In the event the participant does not continue
   employment, the provisions of Voluntary Resignation apply.
6. Transfer to Other Business Units. A person who transfers to another
   W.W. Grainger, Inc. business unit and no longer participates in the MIP 
   will receive a pro rata payment for the period of time the person was in
   a participating position on the next regular incentive payment date, and
   also will receive any remaining account balance on that date.
7. First Year Participation for Continuing Employees. Individuals who are
   hired, promoted, or transferred into a position eligible for participation
   in the MIP and who are participants for 6 months or more, but less than a
   year, will receive a pro rata payment.

Exceptions to the above provisions can only be approved by the CCOM. The 
Company reserves the right to modify, amend, or terminate the program.




                 Post-Service Benefits For Non-Management Directors
                    As Amended and Restated Effective 12/8/93

1. Consulting Service.
   Each non-management Director who leaves the Board of Directors in good
   standing, and who is eligible as defined below, will be entitled to a post-
   service benefit of an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the basic
   Board retainer fee in effect at the time of payment, for a number of years
   equal to the number of years of service on the Board, up to a maximum of
   10 years. Eligibility is determined by any one of the following:
    (a)  Age 70.
    (b)  Five or more years of Board service.
    (c)  Permanent disability or death.
   
   As a condition for receiving these payments a subject Director shall be
   available to the Company on a consulting basis, and shall not compete in any
   way with the Company or engage in any practice detrimental to the Company.
   The determination of whether the Director is engaging in competitive or
   detrimental practices rests solely with the Company.
   
   Payments entitled to a Director who dies in office or during the payout
   period will be made to his or her spouse, but will cease on the spouse's
   death.
  
   Benefits under this program are not funded, and may not be assigned or 
   alienated by the Director. Payments, which commence at the time of 
   termination, will be made through the Corporate Secretary's office on a 
   quarterly basis.

   This program may be amended or revoked at any time by the Board, except
   that a series of post-service payments, once started, can be canceled only
   on  a determination of competitive or detrimental practices.

   This program was adopted 12/5/84 and became effective 1/1/85.

2. Matching Charitable Gifts Program
   During the term of payments under paragraph 1 above, the Director or his
   spouse may participate in the Company's Matching Charitable Gifts Program 
   as in effect at the time.
