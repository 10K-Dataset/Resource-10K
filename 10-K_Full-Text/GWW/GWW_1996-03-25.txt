                                     PART I
ITEM 1: BUSINESS



THE COMPANY


The registrant,  W.W. Grainger,  Inc., was incorporated in the State of Illinois
in 1928. It is a leader in the nationwide  distribution of maintenance,  repair,
and  operating  supplies,  and a provider  of related  information,  serving the
commercial,  industrial,  contractor,  and institutional markets. W.W. Grainger,
Inc. regards itself as a service business. As used herein,  "Company" means W.W.
Grainger, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries as the context may require.

During 1995 the Company  completed the  integration of its Allied Safety (safety
products) unit and continued the  integration of its Bossert  Industrial  Supply
(production  consumable products) unit into the core branch-based  business. The
Company  also  completed  the  consolidation  of  its   administrative   support
functions.  With the completion of the integration of Bossert Industrial Supply,
the Company will operate three business units:  Grainger,  the core branch-based
business (a nationwide  distributor of maintenance,  repair, and operating (MRO)
supplies,  and a provider of related  information),  Lab Safety Supply (a direct
marketer of safety  equipment),  and Parts Company of America (a  distributor of
spare and replacement parts).

The Company  utilizes a satellite  communications  network  which  substantially
reduces its  reliance on phone lines by linking  branches  and other  facilities
together via a network  control  center.  This  results in almost  instantaneous
transmittal of information, which expedites the completion of sales transactions
and the initiation of stock replenishment.

The  Company  does not  engage  in basic or  substantive  product  research  and
development  activity.  New items are added regularly to its product line on the
basis  of  market  information  as well  as  recommendations  of its  employees,
customers,  suppliers,  and other  factors.  Before  being  added to the General
Catalog,  a new  item  must  satisfy  many  evaluation  tests  and  other  rigid
requirements.

GRAINGER


The Company's core branch-based business,  Grainger, is a nationwide distributor
of industrial and commercial equipment and supplies. It distributes motors, HVAC
equipment,  lighting, hand and power tools, pumps, electrical equipment, as well
as many other items.

Grainger now provides  support  functions and  coordination  and guidance to all
business units in the areas of Accounting,  Administrative  Services,  Aviation,
Communications,  Compensation  and Benefits,  Data Systems and Data  Processing,
Finance,   Government  Regulations,   Human  Resources,   Industrial  Relations,
Insurance and Risk Management,  Internal Audit, Legal, Planning, Real Estate and
Construction  Services,  Security and Safety, Taxes,  Employee Development,  and
Treasury Services.

Grainger is an  important  resource  for both  product and  procurement  process
information.  Grainger  provides  technical  information  on products as well as
information on historic  usage of products to customers.  Grainger also provides
feedback to suppliers concerning their products.

Grainger  sells  principally  to  contractors,  service  shops,  industrial  and
commercial maintenance departments,  manufacturers,  hotels, and health care and
educational  facilities.  Sales transactions  during 1995 averaged $133 and were
made to more than 1,300,000  customers.  Sales to the largest  single  customer,
General  Motors   Company,   were  0.7%  of  sales.   Grainger   estimates  that
approximately  30% of 1995  sales  consisted  of  items  bearing  the  Company's
registered  trademarks,  including "DAYTON(R)"  (principally electric motors and
ventilation  equipment),  "DEMCO(R)" (power transmission  belts),  "DEM-KOTE(R)"
(spray paints),  "SPEEDAIRE(R)" (air compressors),  and "TEEL(R)" (liquid pumps)
as well as other  trademarks.  The  Company  has taken  steps to  protect  these
trademarks against infringement and believes that they will remain available for
future use in its  business.  Sales of remaining  items  generally  consisted of
other well recognized brands.

Grainger  purchases  from more than  1,900  product  suppliers  for its  General
Catalog,  most of which are  manufacturers,  and  numerous  other  suppliers  in
support of Grainger Integrated Supply Operations (GISO). The largest supplier in
1995, a  diversified  manufacturer  through 23 of its  divisions,  accounted for
11.0% of purchases.  No significant difficulty has been encountered with respect
to sources of supply.

Grainger offers its line of products at competitive  prices through a nationwide
network of  branches  (344 at  December  31,  1995).  An  average  branch has 15
employees  and handles about 250  transactions  per day.  During 1995,  Grainger
completed the upgrade of the hardware that supports its branch computer systems.
The new hardware has the capacity to accept  enhancements to the Company's order
processing  capabilities.  During 1995, an average of 89,600 sales  transactions
were  completed  daily.  Each branch  tailors its  inventory  to local  customer
preferences  and actual product  demand.  In 1995,  Grainger  invested more than
$53,000,000  in the  continuation  of its  branch  optimization  program,  which
consists of new branches, relocated branches, and additions to branches.

Grainger opened three  additional Zone  Distribution  Centers (ZDCs) and now has
six in operation.  The ZDC logistics strategy provides a break-bulk function for
faster branch stock replenishment.  In addition,  ZDCs handle shipped orders for
their zone and also offer a logistical  solution for integrated supply customers
by coordinating complex orders and multiple receipts,  and combining them into a
single  shipment.  By  reducing  order and receipt  complexity  from the branch,
greater scale within the distribution system is created.

Large  computer   controlled   stocks  which  are  maintained  at  two  Regional
Distribution Centers (RDCs),  located in Greenville County, South Carolina,  and
Kansas City, Missouri,  and a National  Distribution Center (NDC) in the Chicago
area provide the branches and customers with protection  against variable demand
and delayed factory deliveries.  During 1995,  Grainger  transformed the Chicago
area RDC into a NDC. The NDC is a centralized  storage and shipment facility for
slower moving inventory items.

During 1995,  Grainger  completed the integration of Allied Safety into the core
branch-based  business in order to enhance its position as a national  full-line
supplier of safety products.  Similar integration efforts for Bossert Industrial
Supply  (production  consumable  products)  are in process and are planned to be
completed during 1996.

In 1995 the  Company  continued  to  enhance  the  capabilities  of GISO.  As an
integrated  supplier,  GISO provides  access to over three million  products and
numerous  services,  thereby assisting its customers to reduce the number of MRO
suppliers and streamline their procurement  processes.  GISO extends the product
reach of the Grainger  General  Catalog by offering  the full  product  lines of
strategic suppliers.  Grainger has agreements with "Best-in-Class" distributors,
which provide depth in a particular  product grouping.  These  distributors sell
their  products  through GISO as the  integrator,  while  continuing  to provide
technical assistance directly to the customer.

In  1995,  Grainger  developed   relationships  which  go  beyond  these  supply
agreements. "Alliance Partners" participate in the full integration of technical
support,  consolidated  invoicing,  and  consolidated  payment.  These alliances
between  Grainger  and  their  Alliance  Partners  marked  a  milestone  in  the
development of the MRO supply marketplace.

Integrated  supply  customers  lower their MRO costs by  reengineering  internal
business processes and adopting new materials  management systems and practices.
An important part of Grainger's solution is Grainger Consulting Services,  which
provides  customers with expertise in process  mapping,  process  reengineering,
benchmarking,  inventory management,  supplier management, and systems analysis.
During 1995,  Grainger  Consulting  Services  enhanced its  capabilities,  while
working on numerous engagements with Fortune 500 companies.

The Grainger  National  Accounts  Program  focuses on meeting the needs of large
multi-site  businesses by simplifying  customers' MRO purchasing  activities and
providing consistent service and pricing to each customer location.  Daily sales
to National Account  customers  increased 22% on a comparable basis in 1995 over
the prior year. National Account  relationships have been established with about
400 of the nation's largest companies.

Grainger  employs  sales  representatives  who call on existing and  prospective
customers.  Sales representatives are paid a salary and commission. In addition,
a sales force of market  specialists and national  account  specialists has been
developed  to  serve  individualized   markets  and  National  Accounts.   These
specialists   are  paid  a  salary   only.   Grainger   employed   1,488   sales
representatives,   market  specialists,  and  national  account  specialists  at
December 31, 1995.

Grainger  uses direct  marketing  for  customers  who are not called on by sales
representatives.  Grainger's  capabilities  provide  these  customers,  who  are
usually small to medium-sized businesses, with a low cost solution for their MRO
needs.

An  important  selling  tool is the General  Catalog,  which has been  published
continuously  since 1927 and has grown to 3,588 pages  listing over 67,000 items
together with extensive technical and application data. For 1995,  approximately
2,000,000 copies were published.  The most current edition was issued in January
1996.

The Grainger  Electronic  Catalog  brings  directly to the  customer's  place of
business a fast, easy way to select and order products. It is a state-of-the-art
system that uses PC-based software and CD-ROM technology. Through the Electronic
Catalog,  the customer  can use a variety of ways to describe a needed  product,
and then review Grainger's offerings, complete with specifications,  prices, and
pictures.  Other Electronic Catalog features include a cross-reference  function
that allows  customers  to retrieve  product  information  using their own stock
numbers. More than 50,000 copies of the Electronic Catalog are currently in use.
The  Electronic  Catalog is also used at the  branches as a training  tool and a
resource for identifying appropriate products for customers' applications.

Grainger  was one of the  first MRO  suppliers  to  establish  a Web site on the
internet.  The Web site contains useful  information about Grainger products and
services.  Customers  can select  products  from  Grainger's  Web site  catalog,
"WebCat", a format that is similar to the Electronic Catalog.

LAB SAFETY SUPPLY, INC. (LAB SAFETY) AND PARTS COMPANY OF AMERICA (PCA)


Lab Safety is a leading  national  direct marketer of safety  products,  serving
about 350,000 customers from its facilities in Janesville, Wisconsin. Lab Safety
serves the safety  products  markets  with such  items as  respiratory  systems,
protective  clothing,   and  other  equipment  used  in  the  workplace  and  in
environmental  clean-up operations.  The current Lab Safety General Catalog, its
primary selling tool, has over 1,100 pages, listing  approximately 34,000 items.
During 1995, an average of 4,000 sales transactions were completed daily.

PCA continues to expand its  distribution  of spare and replacement  parts.  PCA
distributes  approximately  190,000 parts, takes orders 24 hours a day, 365 days
per year, and ships stocked items within 24 hours of an order,  most on the same
business  day. PCA gives value to  customers  by being a single  source for many
different  spare  and  replacement  parts  and by  offering  valuable  technical
assistance.  This provides the customer fast and easy access to name brand parts
for most products  found in the Grainger  General  Catalog,  as well as for many
other  products.  During  1995,  an average  of 2,300  sales  transactions  were
completed daily.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS


The Company has concluded that its business is within a single industry segment.
For information as to the Company's  consolidated revenue and operating earnings
see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the
Results of  Operations,"  and Item 8,  "Financial  Statements and  Supplementary
Data."  The total  assets of the  Company  for the last five years  were:  1995,
$1,669,243,000;    1994,    $1,534,751,000;    1993,    $1,376,664,000;    1992,
$1,310,538,000; and 1991, $1,216,554,000.

COMPETITION


The Company faces competition in all the markets it serves,  from  manufacturers
(including  some of the Company's own  suppliers)  that sell directly to certain
segments of the market,  from  wholesale  distributors,  and from certain retail
enterprises.

The principal means by which the Company competes with  manufacturers  and other
distributors   is  by  providing   local  stocks,   efficient   service,   sales
representatives, competitive prices, its several catalogs, which include product
descriptions  and in certain cases,  extensive  technical and application  data,
procurement process consulting services and other efforts to assist customers in
lowering  their total MRO costs.  The Company  believes that it can  effectively
compete on a price basis with its manufacturing competitors on small orders, but
that such manufacturers may enjoy a cost advantage in filling large orders.

The Company serves a number of diverse  markets,  and is able in some markets to
reasonably  estimate  the  Company's  competitive  position  within that market.
However,  taken as a whole, the Company is unable to determine its market shares
relative to others engaged in whole or in part in similar activities.

EMPLOYEES


As of December 31, 1995,  the Company had 11,853  employees,  of whom 9,881 were
full-time  and 1,972 were  part-time or  temporary.  The Company has never had a
major work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are good.

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES


As of December 31, 1995,  Grainger branch  locations  totaled  7,437,000  square
feet, an increase of approximately  2.7% over 1994. Most branches are located in
or near major  metropolitan  areas, many in industrial parks.  Branches range in
size from 5,800 to 58,000  square feet and average  approximately  22,000 square
feet.  A typical  owned  branch is on one  floor,  is of  masonry  construction,
consists  primarily of warehouse space,  contains an air conditioned  office and
sales area,  and has  off-the-street  parking for customers and  employees.  The
Company  considers  that its properties are generally in good condition and well
maintained, and are suitable and adequate to carry on the Company's business.

The significant facilities of the Company are briefly described below:

of any such  proceeding  will have a material  adverse effect upon the Company's
consolidated financial position or its results of operations.

Note:  Net earnings,  excluding  restructuring  charges,  as a percentage of net
sales  were  5.9%  and 5.7% for 1994 and  1993,  respectively.  The  percent  of
increase from the prior year for net earnings,  excluding restructuring charges,
was 5.1%, 19.3%, and 8.5% for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

NET SALES


The 1995 Company net sales increase of 8.4% was primarily  volume related.  This
increase  was  affected  by 1995 having one less sales day than 1994 (on a daily
basis, net sales increased 8.8%). The volume increase can be explained primarily
by the Company's market initiatives and the growth in the national economy.  The
Company's market initiatives  included new product  additions,  the expansion of
branch  facilities,  adding Zone Distribution  Centers (ZDCs),  and the National
Accounts  program.  The core business'  National  Accounts program showed strong
growth for the year. Daily sales to National Account  customers  increased about
22% on a comparable basis. The core business experienced selling price increases
of about 1.5% when comparing  1995 with 1994. All geographic  areas for the core
business contributed to the sales growth, with the percent increases for regions
east of the Mississippi being slightly higher than for regions in the west.

The 1994 Company net sales increase of 15.0% was primarily  volume related;  the
Grainger core branch-based business actually experienced selling price deflation
of 0.6%.  This increase was affected by 1994 having one more sales day than 1993
(on a daily basis,  sales increased 14.6%).  All geographic areas contributed to
the sales growth, with the percent increases for regions east of the Mississippi
being  higher  than for  regions  in the west.  The  volume  increase  primarily
represented  the  continuing  effects  of  Company  market  initiatives  and the
accelerated  growth of the national  economy.  The Company's market  initiatives
included  new product  additions,  pricing  actions,  the  continuing  effect of
expanding  branch and adding Zone  Distribution  facilities,  and the continuing
growth of the  National  Accounts  Program.  Daily  sales to  Grainger  National
Accounts increased 25% on a comparable basis over 1993 levels.

NET EARNINGS


Net earnings for 1995  increased  46.0% over 1994 including the effects of after
tax  restructuring  charges  recorded in 1994 (see 1994 Net earnings  discussion
below).  Excluding  the  effect of these  restructuring  charges,  net  earnings
increased  5.1% year over year.  This increase was less than the sales  increase
primarily due to operating  expenses  increasing at a faster rate than net sales
offset by slightly higher gross profit  margins.  Operating  expenses  increased
faster than sales  primarily due to the Company's  continuing  investment in the
business  infrastructure  needed to support  its market  initiatives,  increased
employee  benefits  costs,  and  increased   freight-out   expenses.   Increased
freight-out  expenses resulted from proportionally more shipments qualifying for
prepaid freight and proportionally more orders being transferred within the Zone
Distribution  facilities/branch network. This partially resulted in orders being
shipped longer distances. These incremental expenses, by policy, were not billed
to customers. Partially offsetting these increases were lower bad debt expenses;
payroll costs  increasing  somewhat  slower than the rate of sales  growth;
(10)



and  decreased  amortization  of goodwill and other  acquisition  related  costs
associated  with acquired and start-up  businesses.  The Company's  gross profit
margin increased by 0.06 percentage points when comparing the full years of 1995
and 1994,  excluding the effects of a restructuring  charge of $16,308,000 (0.54
percentage points of gross profit)  associated with inventory  write-downs taken
during 1994. This slight increase was principally related to a favorable product
mix as sales of  non-seasonal  products  grew at a higher rate than the sales of
seasonal  products.  The sales of seasonal  products have historically had lower
than average gross profit margins.  Partially  offsetting the favorable  impacts
was an  unfavorable  change in  selling  price  category  mix,  which  primarily
resulted from the growth in sales to National Accounts.

Net  earnings  for 1994 were  $127,874,000,  net of the  after  tax  effect of a
restructuring  charge of $49,779,000.  Excluding the effect of the restructuring
charge  of  $49,779,000  and the 1993  restructuring  charge  of  $482,000,  net
earnings  increased  19.3% year over year.  This  increase  was greater than the
sales increase primarily due to operating  expenses  increasing at a slower rate
than  sales,  partially  offset by lower  gross  margins.  The lower  than sales
increase for operating  expenses was primarily the result of leveraging  payroll
and related benefit costs,  lower amortization of goodwill and other acquisition
related costs,  and lower  advertising  expenses,  partially offset by increased
data  processing  expenses  related to the  ongoing  significant  upgrade of the
Grainger branch computer systems.  Excluding  restructuring  charges,  operating
expenses  increased  9.0% on a year over year basis.  The  Company's  1994 gross
margin  was  negatively  affected  by  a  restructuring  charge  of  $16,308,000
associated with inventory write-downs. Excluding the effect of the restructuring
charge,  the Company's gross margins  decreased by 1.1 percentage points in 1994
compared with 1993. The gross margin decrease  primarily  resulted from a change
in the selling price category mix and the level of cost increases  exceeding the
level of selling price  increases.  The change in the selling price category mix
was primarily the result of increased sales to Grainger National  Accounts,  and
by a strategic repricing applicable to the contractor customer segment.


                               FINANCIAL CONDITION

Working  capital was  $618,524,000 at December 31, 1995 compared to $504,595,000
at December 31, 1994 and $442,525,000 at December 31, 1993. The ratio of current
assets to current liabilities was 2.4, 2.1, and 2.2 at such dates.

Net cash flows from operations of  $126,285,000  in 1995,  $191,382,000 in 1994,
and  $162,498,000  in 1993 have  continued  to improve the  Company's  financial
position and serve as the primary source of funding for capital requirements.

In each of the past three years, a portion of working  capital has been used for
additions to property,  buildings,  and equipment as summarized in the following
table.

                                                 1995        1994        1993

                                              ========     ========     ========


The Company did not  repurchase  any shares of common stock during 1995 or 1994.
The Company did repurchase  1,777,000  shares in 1993.  Approximately  3,600,000
shares of common  stock  remain  available  for  repurchase  under the  existing
authorization. The Company may resume share repurchases at any time.

Dividends paid to shareholders  were  $45,227,000 in 1995,  $39,570,000 in 1994,
and $36,272,000 in 1993.

Internally  generated  funds have been the primary source of working capital and
funds for  expansion  (including  capital  expenses  relating to the  facilities
optimization  program),  supplemented  by debt  as  circumstances  dictated.  In
addition  to  continuing  facilities  optimization  efforts  and  infrastructure
development to support  current  initiatives,  long-term cash  requirements  are
anticipated for the consolidation of Chicago-area offices in the office facility
to be  constructed  in  Lake  County,  Illinois.  The  Company  had no  material
financing commitments outstanding at December 31, 1995.
(11)



The  Company  continues  to  maintain  a low debt  ratio  and  strong  liquidity
position,  which  provides  flexibility  in funding  working  capital  needs and
long-term cash  requirements.  In addition to internally  generated  funds,  the
Company has various sources of financing  available,  including commercial paper
sales and bank borrowings  under lines of credit and otherwise.  Total debt as a
percent of shareholders'  equity was 5%, 4%, and 7%, at December 31, 1995, 1994,
and 1993, respectively.

                          INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Inflation  during  the last  three  years has not been a  significant  factor to
operations.  The use of the last-in,  first-out  (LIFO) method of accounting for
inventories and  accelerated  depreciation  methods for financial  reporting and
income  tax  purposes  result in a  substantial  recognition  of the  effects of
inflation in the primary financial statements.

The major impact of inflation is on buildings  and  improvements,  where the gap
between historic cost and replacement cost continues to be significant for these
long lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets
increases significantly when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation.

The Company believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the
interests  of  investors  lies  in  continued   application  of  basic  business
principles,  which include improving  productivity,  increasing  working capital
turnover,  and offering  products and  services  which can command  proper price
levels in the marketplace.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Shareholders and
   Board of Directors of
   W.W. Grainger, Inc.

   We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  W.W.
Grainger, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, and the
related  consolidated  statements of earnings,  shareholders'  equity,  and cash
flows  for  the  years  then  ended.   These   financial   statements   are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

   We  conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of W.W. Grainger,
Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  1995,  1994,  and  1993,  and the
consolidated  results of their operations and their  consolidated cash flows for
the  years  then  ended,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted   accounting
principles.

     We have also audited  Schedule II of W. W. Grainger,  Inc. and Subsidiaries
for the years ended  December 31, 1995,  1994,  and 1993.  In our opinion,  this
Schedule presents fairly, in all material respects,  the information required to
be set forth therein. GRANT THORNTON LLP

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993


NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INDUSTRY INFORMATION

The Company is a leader in the nationwide  distribution of maintenance,  repair,
and  operating  supplies,  and a provider  of related  information,  serving the
commercial,  industrial,  contractor,  and  institutional  markets.  The Company
operates within a single industry segment.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from
the consolidated financial statements.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

In  preparing  financial   statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles,  management is required to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
estimates of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  (SFAS) No. 109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes" (see Note 14) and SFAS
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"
(see Note 9). In the fourth quarter of 1993, retroactive to January 1, 1993, the
Company  adopted  SFAS  No.  112,  "Employers'   Accounting  for  Postemployment
Benefits" (see Note 9).

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

PROPERTY, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT

Property,  buildings,  and equipment are valued at cost. For financial statement
purposes,  depreciation and  amortization are provided in amounts  sufficient to
relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service
lives, principally on the declining-balance and sum-of-the-years-digits methods.
The principal  estimated  useful lives used in determining  depreciation  are as
follows:

Buildings, structures, and improvements.............             10 to 45 years
Machinery and equipment................. ...........              5 to 10 years
Furniture, fixtures, and other equipment............              3 to 10 years

Improvements  to leased  property are being  amortized over the initial terms of
the  respective  leases  or the  estimated  service  lives of the  improvements,
whichever is shorter.

The Company capitalized interest costs of $2,136,000, $1,929,000, and $1,258,000
in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

PURCHASED TAX BENEFITS

The Company  purchased tax benefits  through  leases as provided by the Economic
Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Realized tax benefits, net of repayments, are included
in Deferred Income Taxes.

INCOME TAXES

The  Company  uses  the  maximum  allowable  accelerated  depreciation  methods.
Deferred  income  taxes are  provided to  recognize  the  temporary  differences
between financial and tax reporting.

PURCHASE OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK

Through   December  31,  1993,   the  Company  was  required  by  its  state  of
incorporation  to retire any Common Stock it purchased.  The excess of cost over
par value was charged  proportionately  to  Additional  contributed  capital and
Retained earnings.  Effective January 1, 1994, the Company is no longer required
by its state of incorporation to retire Common Stock purchases.

EARNINGS PER COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARE

Earnings  per common and common  equivalent  share are  computed  based upon the
weighted  average number of shares  outstanding  during each year which includes
outstanding options for Common Stock, when dilutive.

NOTE 2--RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

In December 1993,  the Company  announced its decision to integrate its sanitary
supply  business with the core  business.  Based on the results of that program,
the Company  announced in July 1994 its  intention to  similarly  integrate  its
Allied  Safety  (safety  products)  and Bossert  Industrial  Supply  (production
consumable  products)  units.  In  conjunction  with  the  integration  of these
business  units,  the  Company  also  began the  process  of  consolidating  its
financial,  information  services,  and human resource functions.  In the fourth
quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a $67,097,000  pretax charge  ($48,398,000
or 94 cents per share on an after tax basis) to  recognize  the  expected  costs
associated with the above efforts. Total restructuring charges for 1994 and 1993
were:

NOTE 3--CASH FLOWS

The Company considers  investments in highly liquid debt instruments,  purchased
with an original  maturity of ninety days or less, to be cash  equivalents.  For
cash  equivalents the carrying amount  approximates  fair value due to the short
maturity of those instruments. Cash paid during the year for:

NOTE 4--CASH

Checks outstanding of $40,027,000,  $37,088,000, and $16,521,000 are included in
Trade accounts payable at December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

NOTE 5--CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company places temporary cash  investments with  institutions of high credit
quality  and,  by  policy,  limits  the  amount  of credit  exposure  to any one
institution.

The Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries doing
business  in all regions of the United  States.  Consequently,  in  management's
opinion, no significant concentration of credit risk exists for the Company.

NOTE 6--INVENTORIES

Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale.

Inventories would have been $194,854,000,  $184,364,000, and $179,450,000 higher
than  reported  at December  31,  1995,  1994,  and 1993,  respectively,  if the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory accounting had been used.

NOTE 7--OTHER ASSETS

Included in other assets are  intangibles  such as customer  lists and goodwill.
Customer  lists are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over periods of five to
sixteen years.  Goodwill represents the cost in excess of net assets of acquired
companies  and is  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over forty  years.  The
carrying value of intangible assets is periodically  reviewed by the Company and
impairments are recognized when the present value of projected future cash flows
is less than their carrying value.  Effective January 1, 1996,  impairments will
be recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," if applicable.
Other assets at December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993 were:

Other assets  decreased in 1994 primarily due to the revaluation of goodwill and
other intangibles that occurred in conjunction with the restructuring charges as
described in Note 2.

$54,000,000 at December 31, 1994,  and  $28,500,000 at December 31, 1993. Of the
total  available  at  December  31,  1995,  $50,000,000  was in place to support
commercial paper, and carried  commitment fees of 1/8%. There were no borrowings
under these credit lines. The remaining  $4,500,000  credit line at December 31,
1995 was used to support working  capital needs.  This line carried a commitment

NOTE 9--EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

RETIREMENT  PLANS.  A  majority  of the  Company's  employees  are  covered by a
noncontributory  profit  sharing plan.  This plan  provides for annual  employer
contributions  based upon a formula related primarily to earnings before federal
income  taxes,  limited to 15% of the total  compensation  paid to all  eligible
employees.  The Company  also  sponsors  additional  profit  sharing and defined
contribution plans which cover most other employees.  Provisions under all plans
were $47,323,000,  $46,117,000, and $42,056,000 for the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT  BENEFITS.  The Company has a health care  benefits plan covering
most of its retired employees and their dependents.  A majority of the Company's
employees  become  eligible for these  benefits when they qualify for retirement
while working for the Company.

The  amount  charged  to  operating  expense  for  Postretirement  benefits  was
$3,488,000,  $3,153,000,  and  $2,600,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995,
1994, and 1993, respectively. Components of the expense were:

Participation  in the plan is voluntary at retirement and requires  participants
to make  contributions,  as  determined  by the Company,  toward the cost of the
plan. The accounting for the health plan anticipates future cost-sharing changes
to retiree  contributions  that will  maintain  the current  cost-sharing  ratio
between the Company and the retirees. A Group Benefit Trust has been established
as the vehicle to process benefit payments. The assets of the trust are invested
in a Standard & Poors 500 index fund.  The assumed  weighted  average  long-term
rate of return is 6.1%, which is net of a 40.5% tax rate.

The funding of the trust is an  estimated  amount which is intended to allow the
maximum  deductible  contribution  under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as
amended, and was $2,409,000, $737,000, and $211,000 for the years ended December
31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

A reconciliation  of funded status as of December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993 is as
follows:

In determining  the APBO as of December 31, 1995, the assumed  weighted  average
discount rate used was 7.5%. To determine the APBO as of December 31, 1994,  the
assumed  weighted  average  discount  rate was 8.5%. To determine the APBO as of
December 31, 1993,  the assumed  weighted  average  discount rate was 7.3%.  The
assumed  health care cost trend rate for 1996 through 1998 was 10.0%.  Beginning
in 1999,  the assumed  health care cost trend rate  declines on a  straight-line
basis until 2008, when the ultimate trend rate of 5.6% will be achieved.

If the assumed health care cost trend rate was increased by one percentage point
for each year,  the APBO as of December 31, 1995 would  increase by  $7,283,000.
The aggregate of the service cost and interest  cost  components of the 1995 net
periodic postretirement benefits expense would increase by $996,000.

POSTEMPLOYMENT  BENEFITS. In the fourth quarter of 1993,  retroactive to January
1,  1993,  the  Company  adopted  SFAS  No.  112,  "Employer's   Accounting  for
Postemployment  Benefits."  This  statement  requires  the  accrual  of  certain
benefits provided to former or inactive  employees,  after employment but before
retirement, if attributable to an employee's service already rendered.

The  Company's  postemployment  benefits  accrued  under SFAS No.  112  included
long-term  disability  health  care  benefits,   short-term   disability  salary
continuation   benefits,   and  COBRA   benefits   in   excess  of   participant
contributions. The cumulative effect at January 1, 1993 of adopting SFAS No. 112
reduced Net earnings by $4,033,000 or eight cents per share.  The effect of this
change on 1993 Net earnings before the cumulative  effect of accounting  changes
was not material.

NOTE 12--STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

The Company's  Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan ("The Plan") allows the Company to
grant a variety of  incentive  awards to key  employees  of the  Company.  These
awards  involve the use of a maximum of  4,028,414  shares of common  stock,  in
connection  with  awards of  non-qualified  stock  options,  stock  appreciation
rights, restricted stock, phantom stock rights, and other stock-based awards.

The Plan  authorizes  the  granting  of  restricted  stock  which is held by the
Company  until  certain  terms and  conditions  as  specified by the Company are
satisfied.  Except for the right of disposal,  holders of restricted  stock have
full  shareholders'  rights during the period of restriction,  including  voting
rights  and the right to  receive  dividends.  Compensation  expense  related to
restricted  stock  awards  is based  upon  market  price at date of grant and is
charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the period of restriction.

The Plan authorizes the granting of options to purchase shares at a price of not
less than 85% of the closing  market price on the last trading day preceding the
date of grant.  The options expire within ten years after the date of grant. The
Plan also permits the granting of stock appreciation rights,  either alone or in
tandem with  options  already  granted  and to be granted in the  future.  Stock
appreciation  rights permit the holder to receive stock,  cash, or a combination
thereof,  equal to the  amount  by which  the fair  market  value on the date of
exercise exceeds the option price.

Exercise of a stock option or a stock appreciation right  automatically  cancels
any respective tandem stock appreciation right or stock option.

Shares  covered  by  terminated,   surrendered  or  canceled  options  or  stock
appreciation rights that are unexercised,  by forfeited  restricted stock, or by
the  forfeiture of other awards that do not result in shares being  issued,  are
again available for awards under the Plan.

(30)



There  were no shares of  restricted  stock  issued in 1995 or 1994.  There were
2,650  shares of  restricted  stock  issued in 1993.  In 1995,  1,050  shares of
restricted  stock were  released.  In 1994 and 1993,  4,615 shares of restricted
stock were released each year. There were 650 shares canceled in 1994.

There was no activity  relating to stock  appreciation  rights in 1995, 1994, or
1993,  and at  December  31,  1995,  there  were no  stock  appreciation  rights
outstanding.

Transactions involving stock options are summarized as follows:

Options available for grant were 2,964,869, 3,172,009, and 3,361,139 at December
31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  All options were issued at market price
on the date of grant.

In October,  1995, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation." The effective date of this statement
is for fiscal  years  beginning  after  December 15, 1995.  The  statement  will
require the Company  either to adopt SFAS No. 123 and  recognize  an expense for
stock  compensation  in the financial  statements or continue  accounting  under
Accounting  Principles Board Opinion (APBO) No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees" with additional pro forma footnote disclosure regarding the impact
on Net earnings and Net earnings per share had the Company adopted SFAS No. 123.

It is the Company's intent to continue to account for stock  compensation  under
APBO No. 25 with  additional  footnote  disclosure  regarding  the impact on Net
earnings and Net  earnings  per share had the Company  adopted SFAS No. 123. The
Company will provide the additional footnote disclosure in 1996.

NOTE 13--ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

The  Company  has  adopted a  Shareholder  Rights  Plan,  under  which  there is
outstanding  one preferred  share  purchase  right (Right) for each  outstanding
share of the Company's Common Stock.  Each Right,  under certain  circumstances,
may be  exercised to purchase  one  two-hundredth  of a share of Series A Junior
Participating  Preferred  Stock  (intended to be the economic  equivalent of one
share of the Company's Common Stock) at a price of $125,  subject to adjustment.
The  Rights  become  exercisable  only  after a person or a group,  other than a
person or group exempt under the plan,  acquires or announces a tender offer for
20% or more of the Company's  Common Stock.  If a person or group,  other than a
person or group  exempt under the plan,  acquires  20% or more of the  Company's
Common  Stock  or if the  Company  is  acquired  in a merger  or other  business
combination  transaction,  each Right generally entitles the holder,  other than
such person or group, to purchase,  at the  then-current  exercise price,  stock
and/or other securities or assets of the Company or the acquiring company having
a market value of twice the exercise price.

(31)



The Rights expire on May 15, 1999 unless  earlier  redeemed.  They generally are
redeemable  at $.01 per Right until thirty days  following  announcement  that a
person  or  group,  other  than a person or group  exempt  under  the plan,  has
acquired 20% or more of the Company's Common Stock. They are also  automatically
redeemable,  at the redemption price, upon consummation of certain  transactions
approved by shareholders in accordance with procedures provided in the plan. The
Rights do not have voting or dividend rights and, until they become exercisable,
have no dilutive effect on the earnings of the Company.

NOTE 14--INCOME TAXES

Effective  January 1, 1993, the Company  adopted SFAS No. 109,  "Accounting  for
Income Taxes." The cumulative  effect of this  accounting  change  increased net
earnings by $3,213,000 or six cents per share in 1993.  The adoption of SFAS No.
109  changed  the  Company's  method of  accounting  for  income  taxes from the
deferred  method to an asset and  liability  approach.  Previously  the  Company
deferred  the tax  effects of timing  differences  between  financial  reporting
income  and  taxable  income.  The asset and  liability  approach  requires  the
recognition of deferred tax  liabilities  and assets for the expected future tax
consequences  of temporary  differences  between the financial bases and the tax
bases of assets and liabilities.

Income tax expense consisted of the following:

The deferred tax benefits represent the net effect of the changes in the amounts
of temporary differences.

The  income  tax  effects  of  temporary  differences  that gave rise to the net
deferred tax asset as of December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993 were:
