      CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1: Business

The Company

W.W. Grainger, Inc., incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, is in the service
          business. It distributes products used by businesses and institutions across
          North America to keep their facilities and equipment running. The words
          “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc., and its
          subsidiaries in this report.

Grainger uses a multichannel business
model to serve more than 1.6 million customers of all sizes with multiple ways to find and
purchase products through a network of branches, field sales forces, direct marketing
through catalogs and Internet channels. Orders can be placed via telephone, fax, Internet
or in person. Products are available for immediate pick-up or for shipment.

Grainger reports its operating
results in three segments: Branch-based Distribution, Lab Safety and Integrated Supply.
The Branch-based Distribution businesses primarily serve the needs of North American
businesses for facility maintenance products. Lab Safety Supply, Inc. (Lab Safety), a
direct marketing company, serves customers who purchase safety, industrial and other
products. Integrated Supply serves customers seeking to outsource some or all of their
indirect materials management processes.

Grainger also has internal business
support functions which provide coordination and guidance in the areas of accounting,
administrative services, business development, communications, compensation and benefits,
employee development, enterprise systems, finance, human resources, insurance and risk
management, internal audit, investor relations, legal, real estate and construction
services, security and safety, taxes and treasury services. These services are provided in
varying degrees to all business units.

Grainger does not engage in basic or
substantive product research and development activities. Items are regularly added to and
deleted from Grainger’s product lines on the basis of market information,
recommendations of customers and suppliers and other factors.

Branch-based Distribution

The Branch-based Distribution
businesses provide North American customers with product solutions for their facility
maintenance and other product needs through logistics networks which are configured for
rapid product availability. Grainger offers a broad selection of facility maintenance and
other products through local branches, catalogs and the Internet. The Branch-based
Distribution businesses consist of the following Grainger divisions: Industrial Supply,
Acklands-Grainger Inc. (Canada), FindMRO, Export, Global Sourcing, Parts, Grainger, S.A.
de C.V. (Mexico) and Grainger Caribe Inc. (Puerto Rico). The more significant of these
businesses are described below.

Industrial Supply

Industrial Supply offers U.S.
businesses and institutions a combination of product breadth, local availability, speed of
delivery, simplicity of ordering and competitively priced products. Industrial Supply
distributes tools, lighting products, test instruments, cleaning supplies, material
handling equipment, pumps and plumbing supplies, motors and many other items. Its
customers range from small and medium-sized businesses to large corporations and
governmental organizations. During 2003, Industrial Supply completed an average of 88,000
sales transactions daily.

Industrial Supply operates 394
branches located in all 50 states. These branches are generally located within 20 minutes
of the majority of U.S. businesses and serve the immediate needs of their local markets
allowing customers to pick up items directly from the branches.

Industrial Supply’s branches
range in size from small branches to large master branches. Branches are used to fulfill
will-call needs and customer service. Master branches handle a higher volume of
counter/will-call customers daily, in addition to shipping to customers for other branches
in their area. On average, a branch is 20,000 square feet in size, has 10 employees and
handles about 220 transactions per day. Also in 2003, Industrial Supply invested
approximately $1.4 million in plant and equipment related to one new branch, three branch
relocations and several branch additions and remodelings. No branches were closed in 2003.

In 2000, Industrial Supply began the
process of reconfiguring its distribution network to remove a warehousing step from its
distribution system. When completed, the new network will comprise nine distribution
centers (DCs) – five new and four redesigned facilities – that will take over
most of the shipping previously handled by the branches. Eight of the nine distribution
centers have been completed. The ninth, a DC located in New Jersey, is expected to be
completed in April 2004. The DCs average more than 300,000 square feet in size and employ
automated equipment and processes. DCs ship orders, including Internet orders, directly to
customers for all branches located in their service area and replenish branch inventories.
The DC located in Chicago is also a national distribution center providing customers and
the entire network with slower moving inventory items.


Industrial Supply sells principally
to customers which include industrial and commercial maintenance departments, service
shops, manufacturers, hotels, government, retail organizations, transportation businesses,
contractors, and healthcare and educational facilities. Sales transactions during 2003
were made to approximately 1.3 million customers. Approximately 24% of 2003 sales
consisted of items bearing the Company’s registered trademarks, including DAYTON®
(principally electric motors, heating and ventilation equipment), TEEL® (liquid
pumps), SPEEDAIRE® (air compressors), AIR HANDLER® (air filtration equipment),
DEM-KOTE® (spray paints), WESTWARD® (principally hand and power tools),
CONDOR™ (safety products) and LUMAPRO® (task and outdoor lighting), as well as
other Company trademarks. Grainger has taken steps to protect these trademarks against
infringement and believes that they will remain available for future use in its business.
Sales of remaining items generally consisted of products carrying the names of other
well-recognized brands.

The current Industrial Supply
catalog, issued in February 2004, offers more than 82,000 facility maintenance and other
products. Approximately 1.5 million copies of the catalog were produced. A CD-ROM version
of the catalog supplements the paper version. Approximately 550,000 copies of the CD-ROM
catalog were produced.

Customers can purchase products
through grainger.com. This Web site serves as a prominent service channel for the
Industrial Supply division. Customers have access to a much larger selection of products
through grainger.com than is contained in the catalog. It is available 24/7, providing
real-time product availability, customer-specific pricing, multiple product search
capabilities, customer personalization, and links to customer support and the fulfillment
system. For large customers interested in connecting to grainger.com through sophisticated
purchasing platforms, grainger.com has a universal connection. This technology translates
the different data formats used by electronic marketplaces, exchanges, and e-procurement
systems and allows information from these systems to be fed directly into Industrial
Supply’s operating platform. Orders processed through grainger.com resulted in sales
of $478.6 million in 2003, $419.5 million in 2002 and $332.5 million in 2001.

Industrial Supply purchases products
for sale from approximately 1,200 suppliers, most of which are manufacturers. No single
supplier comprised more than 10% of Industrial Supply’s purchases and no significant
difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply.

Acklands-Grainger Inc.
(Acklands)

Acklands is Canada’s leading
broad-line distributor of industrial, automotive fleet and safety supplies. It serves
customers through 174 branches and five distribution centers across Canada. Acklands
distributes tools, lighting products, safety supplies, pneumatics, instruments, welding
equipment and supplies, motors and shop equipment, and many other items. During 2003,
approximately 14,000 sales transactions were completed daily. A comprehensive catalog,
printed in both English and French, showcases the product line to facilitate customer
selection. This catalog, with more than 43,000 products, supports the efforts of field
sales representatives throughout Canada. In addition, customers can purchase products
through www.acklandsgrainger.com.

FindMRO

FindMRO is a sourcing service.
Through sophisticated search technologies and sourcing expertise, FindMRO locates
facilities maintenance and other products when a source is unknown to the customer.
FindMRO has access to more than 4,000 suppliers and five million products. Orders can be
placed with a Grainger sales representative or a branch employee.

Global Sourcing

Global Sourcing procures
competitively priced, high-quality products produced outside the United States. Grainger
businesses sell these items primarily under private labels. Products obtained through
Global Sourcing include WESTWARD® tools, LUMAPRO® lighting products and
CONDOR™ safety products, as well as products bearing other trademarks.

Parts

Parts provides customers access to
more than 2.5 million parts and accessories, stocking nearly 77,000 of them in its
Northbrook, Illinois, warehouse. Customers can purchase parts over the telephone, at
grainger.com, or through a Grainger sales representative or branch employee. Trained
customer service representatives have online access to more than 300,000 pages of detailed
parts diagrams. Parts handled approximately 1.6 million customer calls in 2003 through its
call centers in Northbrook, Illinois, and Waterloo, Iowa.

Mexico

Grainger’s operations in Mexico
provide local businesses with facility maintenance and other products from both Mexico and
the United States. From its five locations in Mexico and U.S. branches along the border,
the business provides delivery of approximately 63,000 products throughout Mexico. The
largest facility, an 85,000 square foot DC, is located outside of Monterrey, Mexico.
Customers can order products using a Spanish-language general catalog or purchase them
through www.grainger.com.mx.


Lab Safety

Lab Safety is a direct marketer of
safety and other industrial products to U.S. and Canadian businesses. Located in
Janesville, Wisconsin, Lab Safety primarily reaches its customers through the distribution
of multiple branded catalogs, including a CD-ROM version, and other marketing materials
distributed throughout the year to targeted markets. Customers can purchase products
through www.labsafety.com, www.benmeadows.com and www.gemplers.com.

Lab Safety offers extensive product
depth, technical support and high service levels. It is a primary supplier for many small
and medium-sized companies and a backup supplier for many larger companies. During 2003,
Lab Safety issued 11 unique catalogs covering safety supplies, material handling, security
and other products, targeted to specific customer groups. Lab Safety provides access to
more than 130,000 products through its catalogs.

In April 2003, Lab Safety acquired
substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Gempler’s, a
direct marketing division of Gempler’s, Inc. Gempler’s is a $32 million direct
marketing business serving agricultural, horticultural, grounds maintenance and contractor
markets with tools, safety supplies, clothing and other items.

Integrated Supply

Integrated Supply serves customers
who have chosen to outsource some or all of their indirect materials management processes.
This service enables customers to focus on their core business objectives. Integrated
Supply offers a full complement of on-site outsourcing solutions, including business
process reengineering, inventory and tool crib management, purchasing management and
information management.

Digital

In April 2001, Grainger announced it
was discontinuing the operations of Material Logic. All of Material Logic’s branded
e-commerce sites were shut down with the exception of FindMRO, which remains in the
Branch-based Distribution segment.

Industry Segments

For 2003, Grainger is reporting three
industry segments: Branch-based Distribution, Lab Safety and Integrated Supply. For
segment and geographical information and consolidated net sales and operating earnings see

“Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

”

and

“Item 8: Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.”

Competition

Grainger faces competition in all
markets it serves, from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell
directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses and
certain retail enterprises.

Grainger competes with manufacturers
and other distributors primarily through local product availability, efficient service,
sales representatives, competitive pricing, catalogs (which include product descriptions
and, in certain cases, extensive technical and application data), electronic and Internet
commerce technology and other efforts to assist customers in lowering their total facility
maintenance costs. Grainger believes that it can effectively compete with manufacturers on
small orders, but manufacturers may have an advantage in filling large orders.

Grainger serves a number of diverse
markets. In some markets, Grainger can reasonably estimate its competitive position.
However, taken as a whole, Grainger is unable to determine with certainty its market share
relative to others engaged in whole or in part in each of the markets where it competes.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, Grainger had
14,701 employees, of whom 12,881 were full-time and 1,820 were part-time or temporary.
Grainger has never had a major work stoppage and considers employee relations to be good.

Web Site Access to
Company Reports

Grainger makes available, free of
charge, through its Web site, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably
practicable after this material is electronically filed with or furnished to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. This material may be accessed by visiting
www.grainger.com/investor.


Item 2: Properties

As of December 31, 2003,
Grainger’s owned and leased facilities totaled 17,991,000 square feet, an increase of
approximately 2% from 2002. Industrial Supply and Acklands accounted for the majority of
the total square footage. Industrial Supply facilities are located throughout the United
States. Acklands facilities are located throughout Canada.

Industrial Supply branches range in
size from 1,200 to 109,000 square feet and average approximately 20,000 square feet. Most
are located in or near major metropolitan areas with many located in industrial parks.
Typically, a branch is on one floor, is of masonry construction, consists primarily of
warehouse space, sales areas and offices and has off-the-street parking for customers and
employees. Grainger considers that its properties are generally in good condition and well
maintained.

A brief description of significant
facilities follows:

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

As of January 28, 2004, Grainger is
named, along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies, as a defendant in litigation
involving asbestos and/or silica filed on behalf of approximately 3,300 plaintiffs in
various states. These lawsuits typically involve claims of personal injury arising from
the alleged exposure to asbestos and/or silica as a consequence of products purportedly
distributed by Grainger. In 2003, lawsuits involving approximately 275 plaintiffs were
dismissed with respect to Grainger based on the lack of product identification. Grainger
has denied, or intends to deny, the allegations in the remaining lawsuits. If a specific
product distributed by Grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits, Grainger would
attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer. In
addition, Grainger believes that a substantial portion of these claims are
covered by
insurance. Grainger is engaged in active discussions with its insurance carriers regarding
the scope and amount of coverage. While Grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these
lawsuits, it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Grainger’s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Item 4: Submission of
Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote
of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2003.

Item 7:
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

General.

Grainger is the leading broad-line supplier of facilities
          maintenance products in North America. Grainger reports its operating results in
          three segments: Branch-based Distribution, Lab Safety and Integrated Supply.
          Grainger distributes a wide range of products used by businesses and
          institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and running. Grainger
          uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options
          for finding and purchasing products through a network of branches, field sales
          forces, direct marketing including catalogs and a variety of electronic and
          Internet channels. Grainger serves customers through a network of 575 branches, 17 distribution centers and multiple Web sites.

Business
Environment.

Several economic factors and industry trends shape
Grainger’s business environment. The current overall economy and leading economic
indicators forecast by economists provide insight into anticipated economic factors for
the near term and help in the development of projections for the upcoming year. At the
start of 2004, the Consensus Forecast-USA is predicting GDP and Industrial Production
growth of 4 to 5 percent for 2004. Grainger’s sales to manufacturers tend to
correlate more with employment levels than with manufacturing output, so job creation, in
addition to manufacturing production, is an indicator for potential sales growth. Most
recently, declining employment in the manufacturing sector, due to increased productivity
and production moving offshore, has adversely affected the operating results of Grainger.

This trend is likely to continue, and
could adversely affect employment levels in one of Grainger’s largest sectors. To
address this trend, Grainger has been focusing on government and commercial customers and
healthcare institutions. To reach more customer groups, Grainger’s market expansion
program will increase branch coverage, expand local availability of products and add local
sales professionals in high potential markets through a multi-year program focused on
local customers.

The customer’s buying behavior
also affects Grainger’s business environment. In 2004, Grainger will continue to
target large, multi-site customers including government and national accounts. Sales from
government accounts grew from 13% of total sales in 2001 to 17% in 2003. Grainger believes
that customers will increasingly focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities
maintenance products. Grainger is addressing this anticipated shift in focus by expanding
its market coverage and increasing product information available to branch employees for
improved service to local customers by accelerating replacement of its legacy information
systems. Grainger’s financial strength, including its low debt and strong cash flow,
leaves it well positioned to fund initiatives to accelerate top line growth.


In 2004, Grainger will be investing
in the branch network and information technology including the following major items:

$70 to $85 million for the
          branch network;

$50 to $55 million for
          information technology;

$15 to $20 million for the
          branch telephone system replacement and

$10 million for completion of
          the logistics network.

In 2004, total capital expenditures of
$200 to $225 million are anticipated, more than double that of recent years. Capital
spending for the market expansion program may be affected by decisions to lease, rather
than purchase, the related facilities and/or equipment.

Matters
Affecting Comparability.

The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued
“Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received
from a Vendor,” (Issue 02-16) in November 2002 with transition provisions
subsequently issued in January 2003. For more detailed information regarding this change
in accounting, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Grainger’s
accounting treatment for vendor provided funds was consistent with Issue 02-16, with the
exception of vendor funded advertising allowances, which had been accounted for as an
offset to operating (advertising) expenses. This accounting treatment is only allowable
under Issue 02-16 in certain specific circumstances. As a result of Issue 02-16, Grainger
will classify the majority of its vendor provided allowances as an offset to cost of
merchandise sold rather than operating (advertising) expenses. Application of Issue 02-16
is on a prospective basis as contracts are either modified or renewed. Since a majority of
the 2003 contracts with provisions for advertising allowances were entered into prior to
December 31, 2002, the amounts classified as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold of
$7.9 million were not material to 2003. This change does not have any effect on net
earnings.

Grainger’s operating results for
2003 include the operating results of Gempler’s, a direct marketing division of
Gempler’s, Inc., from the acquisition date of April 14, 2003. Gempler’s results
are included in the Lab Safety segment.

Effective January 1, 2002, Grainger
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” As a result of the application of the new impairment
methodology introduced by SFAS No. 142, Grainger recorded a noncash charge to earnings in
2002 of $32.3 million ($23.9 million after-tax, or $0.26 per diluted share) related to the
write-down of Acklands goodwill. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2002, Acklands sales declined as
automotive aftermarket parts sales were eliminated due to the creation of the joint
venture with Uni-Select Inc. in Canada. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

2003 Compared to 2002

Grainger’s net sales of $4,667.0
million for 2003 were essentially flat compared to 2002. Full year results were affected
by the general weakness in the U.S. economy. Sales in the Branch-based Distribution
business segment increased $19.2 million over 2002, generally unchanged year-over-year.
Revenue increased in the Lab Safety segment, while sales for Integrated Supply declined.


Despite the limited sales growth
experienced during the year, gross profit margins improved in 2003 to 35.1% from 34.4%
principally due to favorable changes in product mix and selected price increases designed
to offset increased freight and other costs. Grainger’s operating earnings of $387.3
million in 2003 decreased 1.5% from the prior year. Operating margins declined to 8.3% in
2003 from 8.5% in 2002 reflecting higher operating expenses year-over-year. The principal
driver of the operating expense increase was higher severance and healthcare expenses.
Advertising expenses increased as a result of the classification of $7.9 million of vendor
provided allowances in cost of merchandise sold rather than in operating (advertising)
expenses.

Grainger’s net earnings of
$227.0 million in 2003 increased $15.4 million or 7.3% as compared with 2002 net earnings
of $211.6 million. Diluted earnings per share for the year increased to $2.46 in 2003 from
$2.24 in 2002. In 2002, Grainger recorded a $23.9 million after-tax charge for the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The results for 2002 also included
an after-tax gain of $1.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, on the reduction of
restructuring reserves established for the shutdown of Material Logic.

Segment Analysis

The following comments at the segment
level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the
business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating
earnings. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution

Net sales at the Branch-based
Distribution businesses totaled $4,167.2 million in 2003 and were essentially flat when
compared with 2002 sales of $4,148.0 million. Sales in the United States declined
approximately 1% in 2003 as compared with 2002. Government account sales were up nearly
11% in 2003, while all other customer segments, including light and heavy manufacturing,
were down when compared with 2002. The declines noted in the other customer segments were
primarily due to the weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly in manufacturing. Within
these customer segments, sales to national accounts increased approximately 2% over 2002.

Sales growth through Internet
channels continued in 2003, increasing 15.9% over 2002 and representing 12.6% of segment
sales. Grainger will continue to invest in procurement technology to encourage online
purchases by its customers and expects sales growth from Internet channels to continue in
2004.

Sales in Canada increased 15.4% in
2003, principally due to a favorable exchange rate. In local currency, sales grew 2.7%,
primarily in Ontario and national accounts. In Mexico, sales declined 3.7% in 2003 as
compared with 2002, principally due to a weak economy in Mexico.

Cost of merchandise sold of $2,682.6
million for 2003 in the Branch-based Distribution businesses was essentially flat compared
to $2,699.4 million in 2002. Gross profit margins increased 0.7 percentage points to 35.6%
in 2003 from 34.9% in 2002. Selected price increases designed to offset increased freight
and other costs both in the United States and Canada, combined with a favorable change in
product mix, contributed to the margin increase. The classification of vendor provided
allowances from operating (advertising) expenses to cost of merchandise sold also
increased gross profit margin by 0.2 percentage points.

Branch-based Distribution operating
expenses increased 3.9% in 2003, primarily due to higher severance and healthcare expenses
and increased occupancy costs. The classification of vendor provided allowances from
operating (advertising) expenses to cost of merchandise sold also contributed to the
increase.

Operating earnings of $390.2 million
in 2003 declined by $4.7 million or 1.2% as compared with 2002. The increase in operating
expenses year-over-year more than offset the improvement in gross profit margin.

Lab Safety

Net sales at Lab Safety increased by
$18.7 million to $305.5 million in 2003, a 6.5% increase over 2002. The sales growth was
attributable to incremental sales from Gempler’s, acquired on April 14, 2003.
Excluding the results of Gempler’s, year-over-year net sales decreased 2.0% as a
result of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy. A major portion of Lab
Safety’s sales are to manufacturers. The overall decline in the manufacturing sector
was partially offset by increased sales to customers in the forestry and public safety
markets.

The gross profit margin of 42.0%
decreased 0.8 percentage points due to incremental sales of Gempler’s products, which
have lower gross margins than the rest of Lab Safety’s products. In addition, in 2003
there was a shift in sales mix to lower margin new product sales.

Lab Safety operating expenses of
$86.5 million increased 14.5% in 2003, when compared with $75.5 million for 2002. The
primary driver of the year-over-year increase was the incremental costs associated with
the addition of Gempler’s during the year and higher spending on catalog media.

As a result, operating earnings of
$41.9 million for Lab Safety in 2003 declined 11.1% from operating earnings of $47.1
million in 2002.


Integrated Supply

Integrated Supply net sales of $211.7
million in 2003 were $14.3 million lower than $226.0 million of net sales in 2002. The
6.3% decrease in net sales resulted from six site disengagements, as well as lower volumes
from existing customers. The decrease in sales was partially offset by incremental sales
at seven new customer sites. Sales include both product sales, which are passed through to
the customer at cost, and management fees.

Gross profit declined $1.9 million in
2003 due to lower management fees. Operating expenses of $22.1 million increased 5.4% in
2003, when compared with $21.0 million for 2002. The increase of $1.1 million was
principally due to a higher provision for bad debts, combined with incremental costs
associated with a systems upgrade.

Operating earnings of $3.2 million in
2003 for Integrated Supply declined $3.0 million from operating earnings of $6.2 million
in 2002.

Other Income and Expense

Other income and expense was $6.2
million of expense in 2003, an unfavorable change of $10.9 million as compared with $4.7
million of income in 2002. The following table summarizes the components of other income
and expense:

In the fourth quarter of 2003,
Grainger wrote off its investment in two Asian joint ventures resulting in an after-tax
charge to earnings of $1.9 million. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The reduction in gains on sales of fixed assets resulted from the sale of one facility in
2003 versus two in 2002.

Income Taxes

Income taxes of $154.1 million in
2003 declined 5.1% as compared with $162.3 million in 2002.

Grainger’s effective tax rates
were 40.4% and 40.8% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Excluding the effect of the equity
losses in unconsolidated entities and the write-down of these investments, which did not
result in tax benefits, the effective income tax rates were 40.0% for 2003 and 40.5% for
2002. This change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower nondeductible losses
in Mexico and a lower tax rate in Canada.

2002 Compared to 2001

Grainger’s net sales of $4,643.9
million for 2002 decreased 2.3% from net sales of $4,754.3 million in 2001. This decline
resulted principally from decreases in the Branch-based Distribution and Lab Safety
segments and the elimination of the Digital segment. The decrease was partially offset by
an 18.4% increase at Integrated Supply. The general weakness in the North American economy
affected overall sales performance.

Grainger’s cost of merchandise
sold of $3,045.7 million for 2002 decreased 3.8% from the cost of merchandise sold of
$3,165.0 million for 2001. This decrease was primarily volume related due to the decline
in net sales and supply chain efficiencies. Operating expenses of $1,205.1 million for
2002 decreased 3.7% from operating expenses of $1,250.7 million for 2001. Operating
expenses for 2002 included a pretax benefit related to a $1.9 million reduction of a
portion of the Material Logic shutdown reserve established in 2001. Operating expenses for
2001 included a pretax restructuring charge of $39.1 million related to the shutdown of
Material Logic. Despite tight expense controls in 2002, Grainger was unable to decrease
expenses in line with the sales decline. Grainger’s operating earnings of $393.2
million for 2002 increased 16.1% from operating earnings of $338.6 million for 2001.
Operating earnings were affected by a $1.9 million benefit and a $39.1 million expense for
2002 and 2001, respectively, related to the restructuring charge established for Material
Logic. The results for 2001 included operating losses for the Digital segment totaling
$10.2 million.


Grainger’s net earnings of
$211.6 million for 2002 increased 21.2% compared with 2001 net earnings of $174.5 million.
Grainger’s diluted earnings per share for the year increased 21.7% to $2.24 in 2002
from $1.84 in 2001. The results for 2002 included an after-tax charge of $23.9 million
($0.26 per diluted share) related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. The results for 2002 also included an after-tax gain of $4.5 million ($0.04 per
diluted share) from the sales of investment securities and an after-tax gain of $1.2
million ($0.01 per diluted share) related to the reduction of restructuring reserves. The
results for 2001 included an after-tax charge of $36.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted
share, related to the digital businesses described earlier. Excluding all of these items
from both periods and excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle from 2002 results, net earnings increased 8.8% to $229.8 million in 2002 from
$211.2 million in 2001, and earnings per share increased 9.4% to $2.44 in 2002 from $2.23
in 2001.

Segment Analysis

The following comments at the segment
level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the
business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating
earnings. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution

Net sales at the Branch-based
Distribution businesses amounted to $4,148.0 million in 2002, a 2.4% decrease as compared
with 2001 sales of $4,251.6 million. Sales in the United States decreased slightly in 2002
as compared with 2001 primarily due to weakness in the North American economy. While 2002
sales to government and national accounts increased 13% and 6%, respectively, when
compared with the prior year, sales declines in other categories offset those increases.
The increased sales to government and national accounts were primarily due to sales and
marketing programs focused on developing these markets.

Sales were favorably affected by
continued momentum in Grainger’s Internet programs. For 2002, Internet channels
processed sales of $419.5 million, a 26% increase from the $332.5 million processed in
2001. Grainger continued to focus on converting its customers to purchasing online.
Grainger has experienced incremental revenue across all channels from customers who
convert to online purchasing.

In Canada, sales decreased 12.6% in
2002 as compared with 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the elimination of
automotive aftermarket parts sales as a result of the joint venture with Uni-Select Inc.,
established on February 1, 2002. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Excluding the impact of the joint venture, sales were down 5.2% for the year due to the
weakness in the natural resources sector and the loss of a few major accounts. In Mexico,
sales decreased 5.0% in 2002 as compared with 2001. This decrease was attributable to the
weak economy in Mexico, partially offset by selected price increases intended to offset
the declining value of the peso.

Gross profit margins improved due to
selected pricing actions in 2002 intended to cover freight and supplier cost increases and
to favorable product mix. Partially offsetting these improvements were an unfavorable
change in selling price category mix and higher freight costs related to the logistics
project.

Operating expenses increased 1.7% in
2002 versus 2001. Operating expenses increased due to higher payroll and benefits
expenses, partially offset by lower advertising from fewer catalogs being printed and
lower bad debt expenses from fewer bankruptcies of large customers.

Operating earnings of $394.9 million
increased 2.2% in 2002 as compared with $386.3 million for 2001. The effect of higher
gross profit margins was partially offset by lower sales and an increase in operating
expenses.

Lab Safety

Net sales at Lab Safety amounted to
$286.8 million in 2002, an 11.7% decrease compared with 2001 sales of $324.8 million.
Sales at Lab Safety included the results of The Ben Meadows Co., a company acquired on
February 26, 2001. The sales decrease was primarily the result of weak sales in the U.S.
manufacturing sector.

Cost of merchandise sold of $164.2
million for 2002 at Lab Safety decreased by $24.3 million as compared with $188.5 million
in 2001. This decrease was primarily volume related due to the sales decline.

Lab Safety operating expenses
declined $9.7 million in 2002, primarily the result of second quarter 2002 workforce
reductions and other cost control measures, including lower advertising expenditures.

Operating earnings of $47.1 million
at Lab Safety decreased 7.8% in 2002 as compared with $51.1 million for 2001. The decrease
in operating earnings was primarily the result of lower sales, partially offset by lower
operating expenses.

Integrated Supply

Net sales at Integrated Supply
amounted to $226.0 million in 2002, an 18.4% increase over 2001 sales of $190.8 million.
Sales growth for this business was primarily the result of increased penetration of
existing customers and includes both product sales and management fees.

Integrated Supply had operating
income of $6.2 million in 2002 compared with $0.4 million in 2001. This improvement in
operating performance for 2002 was the result of eliminating or restructuring unprofitable
contracts throughout 2001 and productivity gains attained by leveraging the existing cost
structure. Operating income for 2002 also benefited from lower bad debt expense compared
with 2001, where provisions were made for losses related to two large customer
bankruptcies.


Digital

In April 2001, Grainger announced
that it would shut down the operations of Material Logic, with the exception of FindMRO.
Material Logic was launched in January 2001 as a utility for large customers to facilitate
the purchase of facilities maintenance products over the Internet. Material Logic would
have allowed large customers to access a single, networked catalog containing easily
searchable and detailed product information, pre-negotiated prices and availability
information for indirect materials from major distributors. In order for Material Logic to
grow, it needed broad industry support and funding from other equity participants.
Grainger closed Material Logic because economic and market conditions made it difficult to
find funding partners and the market developed more slowly than anticipated. In connection
with this announcement, Grainger took a pretax charge of $39.1 million in 2001. Beginning
with the 2001 third quarter, the Digital segment ceased operations. See Note 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective June 1, 2001, FindMRO was added to the
Branch-based Distribution segment. Consequently, no results were reported for the Digital
segment in 2002, but $30.0 million of net sales were reported in 2001.

Other Income and Expense

Other income and expense was $4.7
million of income in 2002, an improvement of $46.0 million as compared with $41.3 million
of expense in 2001. The following table summarizes the components of other income and
expense:

In April 2001, Grainger wrote down
its investment in other digital businesses and took a pretax charge of $25.1 million. This
included the loss on the divestiture of Grainger’s 40% investment in
Works.com, Inc. (Works.com). Grainger acquired its ownership in Works.com, an unrelated third party, on
August 1, 2000, when Grainger’s OrderZone.com business unit was combined with
Works.com. Of this pretax charge, $20.1 million related to the divestiture of Works.com
and was reported on the income statement as Loss on liquidation of investment in
unconsolidated entity. Additionally, a loss of $5.0 million was included in
Unclassified–net relating to the write-down to net realizable value of investments in
other digital businesses. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

Income taxes of $162.3 million in
2002 increased 32.3% as compared with $122.8 million in 2001.

Grainger’s effective tax rates
were 40.8% and 41.3% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The rate decrease in 2002 as compared
with 2001 was primarily due to a reduction of losses in unconsolidated entities. The
effective tax rate for 2001 was also higher due to the write-down of investments which did
not result in tax benefits. Partially offsetting these items, which increased the 2001 tax
rate, was the tax effect of the write-off of investment in unconsolidated entity that had
tax benefits disproportionate to the write-off.

Excluding the effect of these items,
the effective tax rate was 40.5% for both 2002 and 2001.

Cumulative Effect of
Accounting Change

Effective January 1, 2002, Grainger
adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

In the second quarter of 2002,
Grainger completed the initial process of evaluating goodwill for impairment under SFAS
No. 142. Fair values of reporting units were estimated using a present value method that
discounted future cash flows. When available and as appropriate, comparative market
multiples were used to corroborate results of the discounted cash flows. As a result of
the application of the impairment methodology introduced by SFAS No. 142, Grainger
recorded a noncash charge to earnings of $32.3 million ($23.9 million after-tax, or $0.26
per diluted share) related to the write-down of goodwill of its Canadian subsidiary,
Acklands. Previous accounting rules required a comparison of book value to undiscounted
cash flows, whereas new rules require a comparison of book value to discounted cash flows,
which are lower. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Financial Condition

Grainger expects its strong working
capital position and cash flows from operations to continue, allowing it to fund its
operations including growth initiatives, capital expenditures and payment of cash
dividends.

Cash Flow

Net cash flows from operations of
$394.1 million in 2003, $303.5 million in 2002 and $509.2 million in 2001 continued to
improve Grainger’s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding for
capital requirements. Net cash provided by operations in 2003 increased $90.6 million over
2002. The change in operating assets and liabilities generated cash of $55.8 million in
2003, primarily from a decrease in inventory partially offset by a decrease in trade
accounts payable. The reduced inventory resulted from efficiencies realized from the
redesigned logistics network, and the decrease in trade accounts payable was due to lower
inventory purchases during the fourth quarter. The majority of the decrease in net cash
flows from operations from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to the 2002 inventory infusion to
improve service levels and position the Branch-based Distribution segment to gain share in
an economic recovery.

Net cash flows used in investing
activities were $105.3 million, $105.8 million and $114.1 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Capital expenditures for additions to property, buildings, equipment and
capitalized software were $80.5 million, $144.0 million and $107.2 million in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in
the

Capital Expenditures

section below. Grainger also
funded $36.7 million in 2003 to purchase Gempler’s, and $14.4 million in 2001 to
purchase Ben Meadows, both of which are part of the Lab Safety segment.

Net cash used in financing activities
for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $97.9 million, $158.1 million and $287.1 million,
respectively. Grainger’s funding of treasury stock purchases decreased $58.7 million
in 2003 as Grainger repurchased 918,300 shares in 2003 as compared with 2,221,500 shares
in 2002. Treasury stock purchases were 1,820,000 in 2001. As of December 31, 2003,
approximately 9.1 million shares of common stock remained available under Grainger’s
repurchase authorization. Dividends paid to shareholders were $67.3 million in 2003, $66.5
million in 2002 and $65.4 million in 2001. In 2001, more cash from financing activities
was required to pay off a higher level of short-term debt than in 2002.

Working Capital

Internally generated funds have been
the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion,
supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated. In addition, funds were expended for
facilities optimization and enhancements, business development and systems and other
infrastructure improvements.

Working capital was $926.8 million at
December 31, 2003, compared with $898.7 million at December 31, 2002, and $838.8 million
at December 31, 2001. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.3, 2.5 and
2.5, respectively, at such dates. The current ratio decreased slightly in 2003 due to
Grainger’s cross-currency swap debt being reclassified from long-term debt to current
maturities of long-term debt in 2003, which increased current liabilities at a higher rate
than current assets.

Capital Expenditures

In each of the past three years, a
portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment
and capitalized software as summarized in the following table:

In 2003, Grainger continued to invest
in the logistics network and information technology upgrades, as well as normal, recurring
replacement of equipment. Higher capital spending in prior years reflects incremental
spending for the logistics network project, which began in 2000.

Capital expenditures are expected to
be $200 to $225 million in 2004 and include investments for branches, information
technology, replacement of the branch phone system and completion of the logistics
network. The level of investment in branches may be influenced by decisions to lease,
rather than purchase, the related facilities and/or equipment. Grainger believes that cash
flows from operations will remain strong and expects to fund the 2004 capital investments
from existing working capital.


Restructuring

In 2001, Grainger shut down the
operations of Material Logic, with the exception of FindMRO, and as a result took a pretax
charge of $39.1 million. Grainger has charged $35.9 million against the reserve, of which
$23.0 million represented cash payments. Grainger has also reduced its estimate of expense
by $2.5 million since 2001. As of December 31, 2003, $0.6 million of the reserve remains
for future severance payments and, if not settled early, lease payments. All expenditures
will be finalized in 2004. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Debt

Grainger maintains a debt ratio and
liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and
long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has
various sources of financing available, including commercial paper sales and bank
borrowings under lines of credit. At December 31, 2003, Grainger’s long-term debt was
rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s, a rating it has held since 1987. Grainger’s
available lines of credit, as further discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, were $265.4 million, $264.7 million and $413.1 million, as of December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was
7.5%, 7.2% and 7.8% as of the same dates.

In September 2002, Grainger received
net proceeds of $113.7 million from the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds were
used to repay outstanding long-term debt in the amount of C$180.4 million. The long-term
debt that was repaid with the proceeds of the commercial paper issuance had been
designated by Grainger as a nonderivative hedge of Grainger’s net investment in its
Canadian subsidiary. Grainger entered into a two-year cross-currency swap on September 25,
2002, which replaced the Canadian dollar long-term debt as a hedge of the net investment
in Grainger’s Canadian subsidiary. The counterparty to the financial instrument is an
investment grade financial institution. Grainger does not expect any loss from
nonperformance by this counterparty. Since Grainger has the ability to refinance the
commercial paper with debt having a longer maturity, and its intent is to keep the debt
outstanding for the two-year period of the cross-currency swap, the commercial paper has
been classified as long-term debt. As of December 31, 2003, Grainger had not determined if
it will renew the cross-currency swap when it comes due in 2004. As a result, this
commercial paper debt has been classified as current maturities of long-term debt at
December 31, 2003. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Grainger believes any circumstances
that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt
securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial
condition. Holders of industrial revenue bonds may require Grainger to redeem certain of
the bonds, such as in response to changes in interest rates.

Purchase obligations consist
primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating
needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are
generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for minimum
restocking charges based on the nature of the product.

The above table does not include
$68.0 million of accrued employment-related benefits costs, of which $42.1 million is
related to Grainger’s postretirement benefits, because it is not certain when these
liabilities will come due. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

See also Notes 14 and 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

Grainger does not have any material
exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest
entities or activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair
value.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial
statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions,
which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these
estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger’s results of operations for the
period in which the actual amounts become known.

Accounting policies are considered
critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly
uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those
management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of
Grainger’s financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of
operations.

Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management
judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from
management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Postretirement Healthcare
Benefits

.

Postretirement obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on
assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include,
among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost
trend rates. Changes in assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan
experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger’s postretirement
benefit obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial
condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make
additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit
obligation.

The discount rate assumptions used by
management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of
December 31, the measurement date, of each year in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” A
lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic
postretirement benefit costs. On December 31, 2003, Grainger reduced the discount rate
used in the calculation of

its postretirement plan obligation from 6.5% to 6.0%.
Grainger estimates that the noted reduction in the expected discount rate will decrease
2004 pretax earnings by approximately $1.4 million.

Grainger considers the long-term
historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the S&P 500
to develop its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2003, Grainger increased the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (net of tax at 40%) from 5.4% to 6.0%
based on the improved performance of the postretirement trust funds and the historical
average long-term rates of return. The increase in the expected return on plan assets in
2003 is not anticipated to have a material affect on 2004 pretax earnings.

Grainger may terminate or modify the
postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the
event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure
to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption
that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate,
different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable.


While Grainger has used its best
judgment in making assumptions and estimates, and believes such assumptions and estimates
used are appropriate, changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a
result of actual experience and new trends and therefore, may affect Grainger’s
retirement plan obligations and future expense. Further, the benefit obligation and net
periodic cost may be significantly affected by the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Act) enacted in December 2003. The plan may
also need to be amended in order to benefit from the Act.

For additional information concerning
postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Insurance Reserves.

Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to
workers’ compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization
of deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for
which Grainger does not maintain insurance.

Grainger is responsible for
establishing policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to
project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss
development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its
insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve level.

The use of assumptions in the
analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required
reserve balance is reflected in the current period’s results of operations.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

.

Grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for
uncollectible accounts receivable including: age of the receivable, the historical ratio
of actual write-offs to the age of the receivable and publicly available default rates.
The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an
impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. In 2001,
reserves were increased in anticipation of adverse economic conditions. The economic
downturn that followed did not result in the incremental write-offs expected and as a
result, the reserve requirement declined.

Write-offs could be materially
different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results
deviate from historical trends or published default rates. Historically, the allowance
established for doubtful accounts has been adequate without requiring material adjustment.

Inventory Reserves.

Grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete
inventory. Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to
account for unmeasured usage or loss. Actual inventory shrinkage could be materially
different from these estimates affecting Grainger’s inventory values and cost of
merchandise sold.

Grainger regularly reviews inventory
to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory.
Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and
its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future
product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. Actual results differing from
these projections could have a material effect on Grainger’s results of operations.

Historically, the reserves
established for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory have been adequate without
material adjustments.

Other.

Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of
          measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important
          to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies relating to revenue
          recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets, income taxes and
          warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to
          multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial
          Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, etc.
          Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are
          not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of
          operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies
          can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inflation and Changing
Prices

Inflation during the last three years
has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the LIFO method of
accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting
and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in
the financial statements.


The major impact of inflation is on
buildings and improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost
continues for these long-lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with
these assets increases when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation.

Grainger believes the most positive
means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued
application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, increasing
working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate
prices in the marketplace.

Forward-Looking
Statements

This document contains
forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. The forward-looking
statements relate to Grainger’s expected future financial results and business plans,
strategies and objectives and are not historical facts. They are often identified by
qualifiers such as “will,” “expects,” “intends,” “is
likely,” “when completed,” “anticipates,” “believes,”
“positioned to,” “continue,” “estimates” or similar
expressions. There are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause
Grainger’s results to differ materially from what is projected.

Factors that may affect
forward-looking statements include the following: higher product costs or other expenses;
a major loss of customers; increased competitive pricing pressure on Grainger’s
businesses; failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies;
the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; changes in laws
and regulations; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; disruptions in transportation
services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and other
difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance.

Trends and projections could also be
affected by general industry and market conditions, gross domestic product growth rates,
general economic conditions, including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations,
global and other conflicts, job creation and employment levels, and other factors.

Item 7A: Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Grainger is exposed to foreign
currency exchange risk related to its transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies. During 2003 and 2002, Grainger partially hedged the net Canadian
dollar investment in Acklands with either borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars or
with a cross-currency swap agreement. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. For 2003, a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign
currencies that affect Grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a $0.3
million decrease in net income. Comparatively, a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S.
dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect Grainger and its joint ventures would
have resulted in a $1.8 million increase in net income in 2002. A uniform 10% weakening of
the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $0.3 million increase in income for 2003, as
compared with a decrease in net income of $2.3 million for 2002. This sensitivity analysis
of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential
changes in sales levels or local currency prices. Grainger does not hold derivatives for
trading purposes.

Grainger is also exposed to interest
rate risk in its debt portfolio. All of its long-term debt at December 31, 2003, is
variable rate debt. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the maturity
schedule of the debt outstanding as of December 31, 2003. A one percentage point increase
in interest rates paid by Grainger would have resulted in a decrease to income of
approximately $0.9 million for 2003 and $0.8 million for 2002. A corresponding increase in
net income for the noted periods would have resulted had the interest rates paid decreased
by one percentage point. This sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest
rates on long-term debt does not factor in potential changes in exchange rates or
long-term debt levels.

Grainger is not exposed to commodity
price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities
directly.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT

Shareholders and Board of Directors

W.W. Grainger, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of W.W. Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive
earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of W.W. Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash
flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 3, effective
January 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

In preparing financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and
revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in the 2002 and 2001
financial statements, as previously reported, have been reclassified to conform to the
2003 presentation.

PRINCIPLES OF
CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
TRANSLATION

The financial statements of the
Company’s foreign subsidiaries are generally measured using the local currency as the
functional currency. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of
financial statements of foreign operations and related long-term debt are recorded as a
separate component of shareholders’ equity. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

INVESTMENTS IN
UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

For investments in which the Company
owns or controls from 20% to 50% of the voting shares, the equity method of accounting is
used. The Company also accounts for investments below 20% using the equity method when
significant influence can be exercised over the operating and financial policies of the
investee company. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 2—SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues recognized include product
sales, billings for freight and handling charges and fees earned for services provided.
The Company recognizes product sales and billings for freight and handling charges
primarily on the date products are shipped to, or picked up by, the customer. The
Company’s standard shipping terms are FOB shipping point. On occasion, the Company
will negotiate FOB destination terms. These sales are recognized upon delivery to the
customer. Fee revenues, which account for less than 1% of total revenues, are recognized
after services are completed.

VENDOR CONSIDERATION

Issue 02-16, “Accounting by a
Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor,”
was issued by the EITF in November 2002 with transition provisions subsequently issued in
January 2003. The January 2003 transition rules stated that Issue 02-16 would apply to all
agreements entered into or significantly modified after December 31, 2002. The
Company’s accounting treatment for vendor provided funds is consistent with Issue
02-16, with the exception of vendor funded advertising allowances. The Company has
accounted for these allowances as an offset to operating (advertising) expenses. Under
Issue 02-16, this method is allowable if the allowances are for specific, identifiable and
incremental costs incurred by the Company in marketing its vendors’ products. The
Company provides numerous advertising programs to promote its vendors’
products, including catalogs
and other printed media, Internet and other marketing programs. Most of these programs
relate to multiple vendors, which makes supporting the specific, identifiable and
incremental criteria difficult, requiring numerous assumptions and judgments. Based on the
inexact nature of trying to track reimbursements to the exact advertising expenditure for
each vendor, the Company will treat most vendor advertising allowances as a reduction of
cost of merchandise sold rather than a reduction of operating (advertising) expenses. This
change does not have any effect on net earnings.

Since a majority of the 2003
contracts with provisions for advertising allowances were entered into prior to December
31, 2002, the amounts classified as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold in 2003 were
not material. In 2003, $7.9 million was classified as cost of merchandise sold rather than
operating (advertising) expenses.


For 2004, as new vendor contracts
become effective, most vendor allowances will be classified in cost of merchandise sold
rather than in operating (advertising) expenses. The Company will reclassify prior periods
to maintain comparability. The Company estimates that cost of merchandise sold in 2003
will be reduced by $55.2 million as a result of this reclassification.

COST OF MERCHANDISE SOLD

Cost of merchandise sold includes
product and product related costs, freight-out costs and handling costs. The Company
defines handling costs as those costs incurred to fulfill a shipped sales order.

Beginning in 2003, the Company began
recording vendor funded advertising allowances as an offset to cost of merchandise sold
rather than operating (advertising) expenses as required by Issue 02-16. See subsection
VENDOR CONSIDERATION above for additional information.

WAREHOUSING, MARKETING
AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Included in this category are
purchasing, branch operations, information services and marketing and selling, as well as
other types of general and administrative costs.

STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

The Company maintains various stock
incentive plans. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company
accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related interpretations. The Company recognizes compensation cost for restricted shares
and restricted stock units granted to employees. No compensation cost is recognized for
stock option grants. All options granted under the Company’s plans had an exercise
price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to stock-based
compensation. The following table also provides the amount of stock-based compensation
cost included in net earnings as reported.

ADVERTISING

Advertising costs are expensed in the
year the related advertisement is first presented. Cooperative reimbursements from
vendors, which offset operating (advertising) costs, are recorded when the related
advertising is expensed. Advertising expense was $41.7 million, $26.6 million and $55.1
million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Historically, vendor provided allowances
were recorded as an offset to operating (advertising) expenses. In accordance with Issue
02-16, $7.9 million of vendor provided allowances were classified as an offset to cost of
merchandise sold rather than operating (advertising) expenses in 2003. For additional
information see subsection VENDOR CONSIDERATION above.

For interim reporting purposes,
advertising expense is amortized equally over each period, based on estimated expenses for
the full year. Advertising costs for media that have not been presented by year-end are
capitalized in prepaid expenses. Amounts included in prepaid expenses at December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 were $12.9 million, $13.7 million and $13.6 million, respectively.

SOFTWARE COSTS

The Company does not sell, lease or
market software. The CD-ROM used by the Company’s customers is a version of the
catalog and is distributed at no charge. Costs associated with the CD-ROM are expensed in
the year incurred.


INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes
in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Income taxes are
recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the determination of financial
statement income, with deferred taxes being provided for temporary differences between
financial and tax reporting.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE
EARNINGS (LOSSES)

The Company’s other
comprehensive earnings (losses) include unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of
tax. Also included are foreign currency translation adjustments, with no related income
tax effects, offset by a designated hedge, net of tax. The cumulative amounts of other
comprehensive earnings (losses) were $2.6 million, $(35.7) million and $(29.6) million, at
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The
  following table sets forth the components of accumulated other comprehensive
  earnings (losses):

CASH FLOWS

The Company considers investments in
highly liquid debt instruments, purchased with an original maturity of ninety days or
less, to be cash equivalents. For cash equivalents, the carrying amount approximates fair
value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

ALLOWANCE FOR
DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

The Company establishes reserves for customer accounts that are
potentially uncollectible. The methods used to estimate the allowances are based on
several factors including the age of the receivable, the historical ratio of actual
write-offs to the age of the receivable and publicly available default rates. These
analyses take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific
industry, group of customers or a specific customer. Write-offs could be materially
different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results
deviate from historical trends or published default rates.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower
of cost or market. Cost is determined primarily by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method,
which accounts for approximately 78% of total inventory. For foreign operations, cost is
determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

PURCHASED TAX BENEFITS

The Company purchased tax benefits
through leases as provided by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Realized tax
benefits, net of repayments, are included in Deferred Income Taxes.

PROPERTY, BUILDINGS AND
EQUIPMENT

Property, buildings and equipment are
valued at cost. For financial statement purposes, depreciation and amortization are
provided in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over
their estimated service lives, principally on the declining-balance and
sum-of-the-years-digits methods. The principal estimated useful lives used in determining
depreciation are as follows:

Buildings, structures and
improvements                                                                                                                               
 
10 to 45 years

Furniture, fixtures, machinery and
equipment                                                                                                                          
3 to 10 years

Improvements to leased property are
amortized over the initial terms of the respective leases or the estimated service lives
of the improvements, whichever is shorter. The Company capitalized interest costs of $0.2
million, $0.4 million and $1.3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

The carrying value of long-lived
assets is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the asset may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated
undiscounted future cash flows resulting from use of the asset, including disposition, is
less than the carrying value of the asset. Impairment is measured as the amount by which
the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.

GOODWILL AND OTHER
INTANGIBLES

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” effective January 1, 2002. Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill is recognized as the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net amount
assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather
tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require.
Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than
its carrying value. Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill was amortized over periods of up to
40 years.


The Company recognizes an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the
intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it can be separated
or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged,
either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Such
intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless the estimated useful
life is determined to be indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are being amortized
over useful lives of three to 17 years. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying
amount of an intangible, subject to amortization, is not recoverable from expected future
cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

The Company also maintains intangible
assets with indefinite lives, which are not amortized. These intangibles are tested for
impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require, similar to the
treatment for goodwill. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value
of these assets is less than their carrying value.

INSURANCE RESERVES

The Company purchases insurance for
catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. It also retains a
significant portion of the risk of losses related to workers’ compensation, general
liability and property. Reserves for these potential losses are based on an external
analysis of the Company’s historical claims results and other actuarial assumptions.

WARRANTY RESERVES

The Company generally warrants the
products it sells against defects for one year. For a significant portion of warranty
claims, the manufacturer is responsible for the expenses associated with this warranty.
For warranty expenses not covered by the manufacturer, the Company provides a reserve for
future costs based primarily on historical experience. The reserve activity was as
follows:

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” The statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered
into or modified after June 30, 2003, except as stated below and for hedging relationships
designated after June 30, 2003. The guidance will be applied prospectively. The provisions
of SFAS No. 149 relating to SFAS No. 133 implementation issues that have been effective
for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003, should continue to be applied in
accordance with their respective effective dates. In addition, certain provisions relating
to forward purchases or sales of when-issued securities or other securities that do not
yet exist should be applied to existing contracts as well as new contracts entered into
after June 30, 2003. Adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations or financial position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.
150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity.” The statement establishes standards for how an issuer
classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity. This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into
or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. It is to be implemented by reporting the
cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created
before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the
interim period of adoption. Restatement is not permitted. Adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not
have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial position.

In December 2003, the FASB issued
FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) (FIN 46R), “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities.” It is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” which replaces FASB Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” and revises the
requirements for consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities with
specific characteristics. The new consolidation requirements related to variable interest
entities are required to be adopted no later than the first reporting period that ends
after March 15, 2004 (as of March 31, 2004, for calendar-year enterprises). The Company
does not expect adoption of this revised interpretation to have a material effect on its
results of operations or financial position.


NOTE 3—CUMULATIVE
EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE

Effective January 1, 2002, the
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” and the
transition provisions of SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” As a result of
the application of the new impairment methodology introduced by SFAS No. 142, the Company
completed its initial process of evaluating goodwill for impairment and recorded a noncash
charge to earnings in 2002 of $32.3 million ($23.9 million after-tax, or $0.26 per diluted
share) related to the write-down of goodwill of its Canadian subsidiary,
Acklands. In
performing the initial and periodic impairment reviews, the fair value of the reporting
units acquired were estimated using a present value method that discounted future cash
flows. When available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples were used to
corroborate the results of the discounted cash flows. The Company performs its annual
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth
quarter of each year and no further write-downs have been required after the initial
write-down noted above.

Previous accounting rules
incorporated a comparison of book value to undiscounted cash flows, whereas the new rules
require a comparison of book value to discounted cash flows, which are lower. There were
no material adjustments relating to the classification of the Company’s intangible
assets or amortization periods as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142.

If SFAS No. 142 had been in effect
for the year ended December 31, 2001, reported net earnings would have increased by $3.3
million as a result of excluding the amortization expense, net of tax, of goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives. Basic earnings per share would have increased to
$1.90 from $1.87 and diluted earnings per share would have increased to $1.87 from $1.84.

NOTE 4—BUSINESS
ACQUISITIONS

On April 14, 2003, Lab Safety
acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
Gempler’s, a direct marketing division of Gempler’s, Inc., located in Wisconsin.
The results of Gempler’s operations have been included in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements since that date. Gempler’s, with annual sales in
2002 of approximately $32 million, serves agricultural, horticultural, grounds maintenance
and contractor markets with tools, safety supplies, clothing and other
equipment.

The aggregate purchase price was
$36.7 million in cash and $0.7 million in assumed liabilities. Goodwill recognized in this
transaction was $22.8 million and is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. Due
to the immaterial nature of this transaction, disclosures of amounts assigned to the
acquired assets and liabilities and pro forma results of operations are not considered
necessary.

On February 26, 2001, Lab Safety
acquired The Ben Meadows Co., Inc. (Ben Meadows) for approximately $14.4 million,
including costs associated with the acquisition. Ben Meadows, a privately held U.S.
corporation with annual sales of $20 million, was a business-to-business
direct marketer specializing in equipment and supplies for the environmental and forestry
management markets. Results for Ben Meadows are included in the Company’s
results since the date of its acquisition. Due to the immaterial nature of this
transaction, disclosures of amounts assigned to the acquired assets and liabilities and
pro forma disclosures are not considered necessary.

NOTE 5—SPECIAL
CHARGES

On April 23, 2001, the Company
announced plans to shut down the operations of Material Logic, with the exception of
FindMRO, and to write down its investment in other digital activities. The Company
launched Material Logic in January 2001 as a utility for large customers to facilitate the
purchase of facilities maintenance products over the Internet. In order for Material Logic
to grow, it needed broad industry support and funding from other equity participants. The
Company closed Material Logic in April 2001 because economic and market conditions made it
difficult to find funding partners and the market developed slower than anticipated. The
Company shut down all of Material Logic’s branded e-commerce sites except
FindMRO,
which was added to the Branch-based Distribution segment.

In connection with the closing of
Material Logic, the Company took a pretax charge of $39.1 million (after-tax $23.2
million) in 2001. The Company provided a comprehensive separation package, including
outplacement services, to 166 employees whose jobs were eliminated. Severance payments
began in July 2001 and will continue until June 2004, when the last severance package
expires. Other shutdown costs include lease obligations which, if not settled earlier,
will continue until 2004. The Company reduced the reserve by $0.6 million and $1.9 million
in 2003 and 2002, respectively, to reflect management’s revised estimate of costs.

In addition, in 2001, as part of
other income and expense, the Company wrote down its investment in other digital
enterprises and took a pretax charge of $25.1 million (after-tax $13.4 million). This
included a $20.1 million pretax loss on the divestiture of the Company’s 40%
investment in Works.com, Inc. (Works.com), which was recorded as Loss on liquidation of
investment in unconsolidated entity. Also included was a $5.0 million write-down to net
realizable value of investments in certain other digital businesses, which was recorded in
Unclassified–net.

The total effect of these charges
amounted to an after-tax cost of $36.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in 2001.

by expense category.

NOTE
6—CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company places temporary cash
investments with institutions of high credit quality and, by policy, limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one institution.

The Company has a broad customer base
representing many diverse industries doing business in all
regions of the United States as well as other areas of North America. Consequently, no
significant concentration of credit risk is considered to exist.

NOTE 8—INVENTORIES

Inventories primarily consist of
merchandise purchased for resale.

Inventories would have been $234.4
million, $227.3 million and $224.3 million higher than reported at December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively, if the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory accounting
had been used for all Company inventories. Net earnings would have increased (decreased)
by $4.3 million, $1.9 million and $(1.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively, using the FIFO method of accounting. Inventories under FIFO
approximate replacement cost.


NOTE 9—INVESTMENTS
IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

In 2001, the Company wrote off its equity investment in Works.com.  See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On February 1, 2002, the Company
finalized an agreement creating the joint venture USI-AGI Prairies Inc. The joint venture
was between Acklands and Uni-Select Inc. (Uni-Select), a Canadian company. The joint
venture combined Uni-Select’s Western Division with the automotive aftermarket
division of Acklands, which operated as Bumper to Bumper. Acklands’ contribution of
net assets was approximately U.S.$14.6 million. Additionally, Acklands’ carrying
value of its investment in this joint venture includes U.S.$5.1 million of allocated
goodwill. The Company has a 50% stake in the new entity, which Uni-Select manages. Net
sales for the automotive aftermarket parts division of Acklands were approximately U.S.$33
million in 2001.

No gain or loss was recognized when
this transaction was finalized. Through February 1, 2002, the results of the
Company’s automotive aftermarket parts division were consolidated with
Acklands.
Beginning February 2, 2002, the Company accounted for its joint venture investment using
the equity method. In 2003, Acklands made a loan denominated in Canadian dollars to
USI-AGI Prairies Inc., of U.S.$3.7 million bearing interest at market rates. The loan is
due and payable on demand.

The Company also has investments in
three Asian joint ventures, with ownership percentages ranging from 11% to 49%. The
Company accounts for these joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. As
start-up businesses, the time frame, or the ultimate ability, to achieve profitability is
uncertain. Reaching profitability is also dependent upon the entities securing sufficient
capital funding to support developmental activities. The losses reflect the start-up
nature of these businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company wrote off its
investment in two of these Asian joint ventures due to their questionable market value and
uncertainty regarding future profitability and capital funding.

The table below summarizes the
activity of these investments.

NOTE 10—INVESTMENTS

Investments consist of marketable
securities and non-publicly traded equity securities for which a market value is not
readily determinable. Marketable securities are all classified as available-for-sale and
are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses on such securities reflected,
net of taxes, in the Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) component of
shareholders’ equity. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” the Company evaluates whether a decline
in fair value below cost is other than temporary based on the amount of unrealized losses
and their duration. Other-than-temporary impairments are recognized in earnings.
Non-publicly traded equity securities are reported at the lower of cost or estimated net
realizable value. Adjustments to net realizable value are recognized in earnings. There
have been no dividends earned on these investments. During 2003, the Company completed the
sale of its investments in marketable securities. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
Company held marketable securities investments of $5.3 million and $27.0 million,
respectively, selling a portion of the original investments during each of those years.
The gains on these sales were calculated using the specific identification method and were
reported in Unclassified–net.


The original cost, pretax realized
and unrealized (losses) gains, reductions to net realizable value and fair value of
investments are as follows:

NOTE 11—CAPITALIZED
SOFTWARE

Amortization of capitalized software
is predominately on a straight-line basis over three and five years. Amortization expense
was $14.0 million, $17.6 million and $19.5 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company reviews the amounts
capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. In 2003, the Company determined
certain capitalized amounts were no longer recoverable and wrote down the carrying cost by
$1.0 million.

NOTE 12—SHORT-TERM
DEBT

The following summarizes information
concerning short-term debt:

The Company and its subsidiaries had
committed lines of credit totalling $265.4 million, $267.7 million and $417.6 million at
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, including $15.4 million, $12.7 million and
$12.6 million, respectively, denominated in Canadian dollars. At December 31, 2003, there
were no borrowings under the committed lines of credit. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
borrowings under Company committed lines of credit were $3.0 million and $4.5 million,
respectively. The Company had committed lines of credit available of $265.4 million,
$264.7 million and $413.1 million at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Company also had a $7.7 million,
$15.9 million and $15.7 million uncommitted line of credit denominated in Canadian dollars
at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


NOTE 13—EMPLOYEE
BENEFITS

Retirement Plans.

A majority
of the Company’s employees are covered by a noncontributory profit sharing plan. This
plan provides for annual employer contributions generally based upon a formula related
primarily to earnings before federal income taxes, limited to 25% of the total
compensation paid to all eligible employees. The Company also sponsors additional defined
contribution plans, which cover most of the other employees. Provisions under all plans
were $45.9 million, $50.0 million and $47.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

Postretirement Benefits.

The
Company has a postretirement healthcare benefits plan that provides coverage for a
majority of its retired employees and their dependents should they elect to maintain such
coverage. Covered employees become eligible for participation when they qualify for
retirement while working for the Company. Participation in the plan is voluntary and
requires participants to make contributions toward the cost of the plan, as determined by
the Company. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its postretirement plan.

The net periodic benefits costs

The benefit obligation was determined
by applying the terms of the plan and actuarial models required by SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.”
These models include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed
rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The actuarial assumptions
also anticipate future cost-sharing changes to retiree contributions that will maintain
the current cost-sharing ratio between the Company and the retirees. The Company evaluates
its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and considers changes in these long-term
factors based upon market conditions, historical experience and the requirements of SFAS
No. 106.


The plan amendment, which changed the
prescription drug benefits, was effective January 1, 2003.

The following assumptions were used
to determine benefit obligations at December 31:

The discount rate assumptions reflect
the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments on December 31 of each
year.

The Company reviews external data and
its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend
rates. Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for the healthcare plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed healthcare
cost trend rates would have the following effects on December 31, 2003 results:

The Company has established a Group Benefit Trust to fund the plan and
process benefit payments. The assets of the trust are invested entirely in funds designed
to track the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500). This investment strategy
reflects the long-term nature of the plan obligation and seeks to take advantage of the
superior earnings potential of equity securities. The Company uses the long-term
historical return on the plan assets and the historical performance of the S&P 500 to
develop its expected return on plan assets. The required use of an expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets may result in recognizing income that is greater or less than the
actual return on plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term
returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns and, therefore, result in
a pattern of income recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services
provided by the employees. The change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets did not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was unchanged in
2002.

The funding of the trust is an
estimated amount which is intended to allow the maximum deductible contribution under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC), as amended, and was $11.0 million, $5.9 million and
$3.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. There
are no minimum funding requirements and the Company intends to follow its practice of
funding the maximum deductible contribution under the IRC.

The Company forecasts the following
benefit payments, which includes a projection for expected future employee service: $1.6
million in 2004, $1.9 million in 2005, $2.2 million in 2006, $2.7 million in 2007, $3.2
million in 2008 and $26.2 million over the five-year period covering 2009 through 2013.

On December 8, 2003, the
“Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003” (Act)
was signed into law. In accordance with FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1,
“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” the Company has elected to defer
recognizing the effects of the Act. Therefore, the benefit obligation and net periodic
postretirement benefit cost in the Company’s financial statements and accompanying
notes do not reflect the effects of the Act on the plan. Specific authoritative guidance
on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and such guidance, when issued, could
require the Company to change previously reported information. Also, the Company may need
to amend the plan to benefit from the Act.


NOTE 14—LONG-TERM
DEBT

Long-term debt consisted of the
following:

During the third quarter of 2002, the
Company refinanced a C$180.4 million bank loan that had been designated as a nonderivative
hedge of the net investment in the Company’s Canadian subsidiary. The bank loan was
replaced with commercial paper in support of a cross-currency swap (derivative
instrument). This derivative instrument was designated as a hedge of the net investment in
the Company’s Canadian subsidiary and is recognized on the balance sheet at its fair
value.

The two-year cross-currency swap
matures on September 27, 2004. The cross-currency swap is based on notional principal
amounts of C$180.4 million and U.S.$113.7 million, respectively. Initially, the Company
gave the counterparty U.S.$113.7 million and received from the counterparty C$180.4
million. The Company receives interest based on the 30-day U.S. commercial paper rate. At
December 31, 2003, this rate was 1.02%. The Company pays interest to the counterparty
based on the 30-day Canadian Bankers’ Acceptances rate plus 19 basis points. At
December 31, 2003 this rate was 2.94%. The outstanding underlying commercial paper was
U.S.$114.1 million with an interest rate of 1.10% at December 31, 2003. The fair value of
the derivative instrument was a liability of U.S.$25.4 million as of December 31, 2003.
The Company has the ability and the intent to refinance the underlying commercial paper
issued in connection with the two-year cross-currency swap with its credit lines through
the swap’s maturity, therefore the commercial paper has been classified as long-term
debt. The Company is determining whether or not it will renew the cross-currency
swap when it comes due on September 27, 2004. As a result, the commercial paper debt and
related derivative instrument have been classified as current maturities of long-term debt
at December 31, 2003. When the cross-currency swap matures, the Company will pay the
counterparty C$180.4 million and will receive U.S.$113.7 million.

The Company formally assesses, on a
quarterly basis, whether the cross-currency swap is effective at offsetting changes in the
fair value of the underlying exposure. Because of the high degree of effectiveness between
the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged, exchange rate changes in
the value of the cross-currency swap are generally offset by changes in the value of the
net investment. Under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” changes in the fair value of this instrument are recognized in
foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
earnings (losses), to offset the change in the value of the net investment of the Canadian
investment being hedged. During 2003, the Company included a U.S.$14.9 million, net of
tax, loss in Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) related to this hedge. The
impact to 2003 and 2002 earnings resulting from the ineffective portion of the hedge was
immaterial. The cross-currency swap is an over-the-counter instrument with a liquid
market. The Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines and entered into
the transaction with an investment grade financial institution. The Company does not enter
into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

The industrial development revenue
and private activity bonds include various issues that bear interest at variable rates
capped at 15%, and come due in various amounts from 2009 through 2021. At December 31,
2003, the weighted average interest rate was 1.58%. Interest rates on some of the issues
are subject to change at certain dates in the future. The bondholders may require the
Company to redeem certain bonds concurrent with a change in interest rates and certain
other bonds annually. In addition, $4.6 million of these bonds had an unsecured liquidity
facility available at December 31, 2003, for which the Company compensated a
bank through a commitment fee of 0.07%. There were no borrowings related to this facility
at December 31, 2003. The Company classified $4.6 million, $6.5 million and $12.5 million
of bonds currently subject to redemption options in current maturities of long-term debt
at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


The aggregate amounts of long-term
debt maturing in each of the five years subsequent to December 31, 2003, are as follows:

The Company’s debt
instruments include only standard affirmative and negative covenants that are
normal in debt instruments of similar amounts and structure. The Company’s
debt instruments do not contain financial or performance covenants restrictive
to the business of the Company, reflecting its strong financial position.

The Company is in compliance with all
debt covenants for the year ended December 31, 2003.

NOTE 15—LEASES

The Company leases certain land,
buildings and equipment. The Company capitalizes all significant leases that qualify for
capitalization, of which there were none at December 31, 2003.

At December 31, 2003, the
approximate future minimum aggregate payments for all operating leases were as
follows (in thousands of dollars):

Total rent expense, including both
items under lease and items rented on a month-to-month basis, was $19.5 million, $18.8
million and $16.6 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Rent expense is net of
sublease income of $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.5 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

NOTE 16—STOCK
INCENTIVE PLANS

The Company maintains stock incentive
plans under which the Company may grant a variety of incentive awards to employees. Shares
of common stock were authorized for issuance under the plans in connection with awards of
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units and
other stock-based awards.

The plans authorize the granting of
options to purchase shares at a price of not less than 100% of the closing market price on
the last trading day preceding the date of grant. The options expire no later than ten
years after the date of grant.

Shares relating to terminated,
surrendered or canceled options and stock appreciation rights, to forfeited restricted
stock or other awards, or to transactions that result in fewer shares being issued under
the plans, are again available for awards under the plans.

In 2001, a broad-based stock option
grant covering 774,500 shares was made to employees who had a minimum of five years of
service and who were not participants in other stock option programs. In 2003 and 2002,
the Company continued to give broad-based stock option grants by granting options covering
161,300 and 89,600 shares, respectively, to those employees who reached major service
milestones.

The plans authorize the granting of
restricted stock, which is held by the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions
related to the applicable grants. Except for the right of disposal, holders of restricted
stock have full shareholders’ rights during the period of restriction, including
voting rights and the right to receive dividends.

On March 26, 2001, a group of 83
executive officers and other key managers bought 787,020 treasury shares from the Company
at the then-current market price of the shares. Cash proceeds from the sale, which
amounted to $24.4 million, were used by the Company to repurchase shares of the
Company’s stock on the open market.


Most employees financed their purchases through
loans arranged with a local bank. As of December 31, 2003, all loans payable were settled
between each employee and the bank. Executives who met a threshold purchase requirement of
one times their annual base salary received a 25% matching grant of restricted stock that
vested if they remained with the Company and held their purchased shares for a minimum of
two years. The grant totaled 192,275 shares of restricted stock. In 2002, 95,720 of these
shares were converted from restricted stock into a like number of restricted stock units,
which are subject to the same vesting provisions as the original restricted stock. These
restricted stock units are to be settled, at various times after vesting, by the delivery
of unrestricted shares of Company common stock on a one for one basis. In March 2003,
95,720 restricted stock units vested.

There were 20,000 shares of
restricted stock issued in 2003 with a weighted average fair market value of $47.72 per
share. There were 110,000 shares of restricted stock issued in 2002 with a weighted
average fair market value of $56.31 per share. There were 247,275 shares of restricted
stock issued in 2001 with a weighted average fair market value of $33.30 per share. The
shares vest over periods from two to ten years from issuance, although accelerated vesting
is provided in certain instances. Restricted stock vested was 96,790, 112,000 and 87,000
shares in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Compensation expense related to restricted
stock awards is based upon market prices at the date of grant and is charged to earnings
on a straight-line basis over the period of restriction. Total compensation expense
related to restricted stock was $4.8 million, $6.4 million and $8.9 million in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. In 2001, $2.2 million of restricted stock compensation expense
related to the 2001 digital business restructuring was included in restructuring charges.

Nonemployee directors participate in
the Company’s Director Stock Plan. A total of 346,630 shares of common stock are
available for issuance under the plan as of December 31, 2003.

A retainer fee for board service is
paid to nonemployee directors in the form of an annual award of unrestricted shares of
common stock under the Director Stock Plan. The number of shares awarded is equal to the
retainer fee divided by the fair market value of a share of common stock at the time of
the award, rounded up to the next ten-share increment. Total shares granted were 6,160,
5,850 and 8,130 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In addition, nonemployee directors
receive an annual grant under the Director Stock Plan, denominated in dollars, of options
to purchase shares of common stock. The number of shares covered by each option is equal
to the dollar amount of the grant divided by the fair market value of a share of common
stock at the time of the award, rounded to the next ten-share increment. The options are
issued at market price at date of grant. The options are fully exercisable upon award
and have a ten-year term. Total option awards were 15,840, 14,850 and 19,200 shares in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Company awards stock units under
the Director Stock Plan in connection with deferrals of director fees and dividend
equivalents on existing stock units. A stock unit is the economic equivalent of a share of
common stock. Deferred fees and dividend equivalents on existing stock units are converted
into stock units on the basis of the market value of the stock at the relevant times.
Payment of the value of stock units is scheduled to be made after termination of service
as a director. As of December 31, 2003, nine directors held stock units. As of both
December 31, 2002 and 2001, ten directors held stock units. The Company recognized expense
for the appreciation in equivalent value of stock units of $1.0 million, $0.5 million and
$0.4 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Total stock units outstanding were
39,506, 45,556 and 45,844 as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Transactions involving stock options
are summarized as follows:


All options were issued at market
price on the date of grant. Options were issued with initial vesting periods ranging from
immediate to six years.

NOTE 18—INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes
under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” SFAS No.
109 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities,
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse. The Company does not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on undistributed
earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which reflect
full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are indefinitely reinvested in those non-U.S.
operations or will be remitted substantially free of additional tax.

$30.6 million of foreign operating loss carryforwards related to a foreign operation,
which begin to expire in 2006. The valuation allowance represents a provision for
uncertainty as to the realization of these carryforwards.

In addition, the Company recorded a
valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be
realized due to capital loss carryforward limitations. The changes in the valuation allowance were as

NOTE 19—EARNINGS
PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is based on
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per
share is based on the combination of weighted average number of shares outstanding and
dilutive potential shares. The Company had additional outstanding stock options of 3.6
million, 2.7 million and 1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market price of
the common stock.

The following table sets forth the
computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

NOTE 20—PREFERRED
SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

The Company has a Shareholder Rights
Plan, under which there is outstanding one preferred share purchase right (Right) for each
outstanding share of the Company’s common stock. Each Right, under certain
circumstances, may be exercised to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A-1999
Junior Participating Preferred Stock (intended to be the economic equivalent of one share
of the Company’s common stock) at a price of $250.00, subject to adjustment. The
Rights become exercisable only after a person or a group, other than a person or group
exempt under the plan, acquires or announces a tender offer for 15% or more of the
Company’s common stock. If a person or group, other than a person or group exempt
under the plan, acquires 15% or more of the Company’s common stock or if the Company
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, each Right generally
entitles the holder, other than such person or group, to purchase, at the then-current
exercise price, stock and/or other securities or assets of the Company or the acquiring
company having a market value of twice the exercise price.


The Rights expire on May 15, 2009,
unless earlier redeemed. They generally are redeemable at $.001 per Right until thirty
days following announcement that a person or group, other than a person or group exempt
under the plan, has acquired 15% or more of the Company’s common stock. The Rights do
not have voting or dividend rights and, until they become exercisable, have no dilutive
effect on the earnings of the Company.

NOTE 21—SEGMENT
INFORMATION

The Company reports three segments:
Branch-based Distribution, Lab Safety and Integrated Supply. The Branch-based Distribution
segment provides customers with solutions to their immediate facilities maintenance and
other needs. Branch-based Distribution is an aggregation of the following: Industrial
Supply, Acklands (Canada), FindMRO, Export, Global Sourcing, Parts,
Grainger, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico) and Grainger Caribe Inc.
(Puerto Rico). Lab Safety is a direct marketer of safety and other industrial
products. Integrated Supply serves customers who have chosen to outsource a portion or all
of their indirect materials management processes. In April 2001, the Company discontinued
its Digital segment except FindMRO, which became part of Branch-based Distribution. See
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s segments offer
differing ranges of services and products and require different resources and marketing
strategies. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. Intersegment transfer prices are established
at external selling prices, less costs not incurred due to the related party sale.

million after-tax. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


NOTE 23—RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTION

On February 28, 2002, the Company
purchased substantially all of the assets, consisting of 4,801,600 shares of Company
common stock and cash, of Mountain Capital Corporation, a Nevada corporation (MCC). In
exchange, the Company transferred to MCC 4,695,725 shares of Company common stock. The
number of shares transferred reflected a 1.5% discount (72,024 shares) from the number of
shares received, and additionally reflected other adjustments designed to reimburse the
Company for its direct transaction expenses of $0.6 million (10,549 shares) and for the
Company’s payment of indebtedness of MCC of $1.3 million (23,302 shares). The effect
on the Company of this transaction was to increase the number of shares held as Treasury
stock, thereby reducing the number of shares outstanding by 105,875 shares. The shares
received by MCC from the Company were subsequently distributed to the MCC shareholders
pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation of MCC.

The transaction documentation
includes:

Prior to the transaction, James D.
Slavik, a Company director, was the president and a director of MCC. In addition, Mr.
Slavik and certain members of his family owned all of the outstanding stock of MCC either
directly or indirectly, including through family trusts of which Mr. Slavik served as
trustee. Mr. Slavik was not present and did not participate in any of the deliberations of
the Board of Directors or any of its committees relating to the review, consideration or
approval of the transaction.

The components of
Unclassified–net were as follows:

NOTE
25—CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS

The Company has an outstanding
guarantee relating to an industrial revenue bond assumed by the buyer of one of the
Company’s formerly owned facilities. The maximum exposure under this guarantee is
$8.5 million. The Company has not recorded any liability relating to this guarantee and
believes it is unlikely that material payments will be required.

As of January 28, 2004, the Company
is named, along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies, as a defendant in litigation
involving asbestos and/or silica filed on behalf of approximately 3,300 plaintiffs in
various states. These lawsuits typically involve claims of personal injury arising from
the alleged exposure to asbestos and/or silica as a consequence of products purportedly
distributed by the Company. In 2003, lawsuits involving approximately 275 plaintiffs were
dismissed with respect to the Company based on the lack of product identification. The
Company has denied, or intends to deny, the allegations in the remaining lawsuits. If a
specific product distributed by the Company is identified in any of these lawsuits, the
Company would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product
manufacturer. In addition, the Company believes that a substantial portion of these claims
are covered by insurance. The Company is engaged in active discussions with its insurance
carriers regarding the scope and amount of coverage. While the Company is unable to
predict the outcome of these lawsuits, it believes that the ultimate resolution will not
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
