PART I

Item 1: Business

The Company

The registrant, W.W. Grainger, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928. It is the leading North American
distributor of products used by businesses and institutions to maintain, repair,
and operate their facilities. W.W. Grainger, Inc. regards itself as being in the
service business. As used herein, "Company" means W.W. Grainger, Inc. and/or its
subsidiaries as the context may require.

The Company offers a breadth of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) solutions by combining
products, services, and information. It tailors its capabilities with a view
toward providing the lowest total cost MRO solution to select customer groups.
The Branch-based Distribution Businesses primarily serve the needs of North
American businesses for MRO supplies. Lab Safety Supply serves customers who
choose to purchase safety and other industrial products through a direct
marketing company. The Other Businesses of the Company serve customers who seek
to outsource their MRO supply procurement and management processes.

The Company also has
internal business support functions which provide coordination and guidance in
the areas of Accounting, Administrative Services, Business Development,
Communications, Compensation and Benefits, Employee Development, Enterprise
Systems, Finance, Human Resources, Industrial Relations, Investor Relations,
Insurance and Risk Management, Internal Audit, International Operations, Legal,
Real Estate and Construction Services, Security and Safety, Taxes, and Treasury
services. These services are provided in varying degrees to all of the business
units.

A number of Company-wide capabilities assist business units in serving
their respective markets. These capabilities include technology and information
management, supplier partnerships, supply chain management skills, and an
understanding of the customers’ MRO environments.

The Company does not engage
in basic or substantive product research and development activities. New items
are added regularly to the Company’s product lines on the basis of market
information, recommendations of its employees, customers, and suppliers, and
other factors. The Company’s research and development efforts are focused
on methods of serving customers and the product distribution process.

In January 2001, the
Company announced it had consolidated three of its digital businesses into a
separate organization. TotalMRO.com, FindMRO, and MROverstocks.com were combined
to create Material Logic, which was designed to allow large customers to access
a single, networked catalog. Material Logic sought funding participation from
other industrial distributors and investors. Economic and market conditions made
it difficult to find funding partners and in April 2001, the Company announced
it was discontinuing the operations of Material Logic. All of Material
Logic’s branded e-commerce sites were shut down with the exception of
FindMRO, which remains as an integrated sourcing service for the Company’s
customers.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

The Company's Branch-based Distribution Businesses provide customers with solutions to their immediate and/or planned MRO
purchase needs throughout North America. Logistics networks are configured for rapid availability. A broad selection of
MRO products is offered at local branches, through catalogs, and via the Internet. The Branch-based Distribution
Businesses consist of Grainger Industrial Supply, Grainger.com, Acklands-Grainger Inc. (Canada), FindMRO, Grainger
Export, Grainger Global Sourcing, Grainger Parts, Grainger, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), and Grainger Caribe Inc. (Puerto
Rico). Described below are the more significant of these businesses.

Grainger Industrial Supply

The focus of Grainger
Industrial Supply is to provide the best combination of product selection, local
availability, speed of delivery, and simplicity of ordering at a competitive
price to United States businesses and institutions of all sizes. Its primary
customers are small and medium-sized companies, but it also addresses
large-sized organizations’ MRO needs.

Grainger Industrial Supply
operates 388 branches in all 50 states. These branches are located within 20
minutes of the majority of U.S. businesses and carry inventory to support their
local market needs. Products are available for immediate pickup or for shipment.

On average, a branch is
20,000 square feet, has 12 employees, and handles about 239 transactions per
day. During 2001, an average of approximately 93,000 sales transactions were
completed daily. Grainger Industrial Supply’s branches range in size from
small “storefront branches” to large “master branches.”
Storefront branches are used to fulfill will-call needs and customer service.
Grainger Industrial Supply has five master branches which range in size from
43,000 square feet to 109,000 square feet and stock the fastest selling 30,000
items. In 2001, Grainger Industrial Supply invested more than $4,000,000 in new
branches, branch relocations, and branch additions. During the year, 13 new
branches were opened, seven were relocated, seven were closed, and a number of
remodeling projects were completed.


Grainger Industrial Supply
currently operates four Distribution Centers and two new highly automated
distribution centers (DCs). DCs ship orders directly to customers for all
branches located in their service area, including Internet orders, and replenish
branch inventories. Two Regional Distribution Centers located in Greenville
County, South Carolina, and Kansas City, Missouri, replenish DC inventories and
some branches not served by a DC. A National Distribution Center, located in
Niles, Illinois, is a centralized storage and shipping facility serving
customers and the entire network with slower moving inventory items.

In 2000, Grainger
Industrial Supply began a multi-year redesign and expansion of its distribution
network that will allow the Company to remove a warehousing step from the
current distribution system. This redesign is not only intended to reduce costs
but also to increase capacity. As part of the redesign, Grainger Industrial
Supply is transitioning its existing zone and regional warehouses into more
highly automated distribution centers. Five new and four redesigned facilities
will take over most of the shipping currently handled by the branches. When the
transition is complete, each distribution center will average more than 300,000
square feet in size, employ state-of-the-art equipment and processes, and stock
60,000 to 70,000 of the fastest selling items.

Grainger Industrial Supply
sells principally to service shops, industrial and commercial maintenance
departments, manufacturers, hotels, government, contractors, and health care and
educational facilities. Sales transactions during 2001 were made to
approximately 1,300,000 customers. It is estimated that approximately 23% of
2001 sales consisted of items bearing the Company’s registered trademarks,
including DAYTON® (principally electric motors, heating and ventilation
equipment), TEEL® (liquid pumps), SPEEDAIRE® (air compressors), AIR
HANDLER® (air filtration equipment), DEM-KOTE® (spray paints),
WESTWARD® (hand and power tools), and LUMAPRO® (task and outdoor
lighting), as well as other of the Company’s trademarks. The Company has
taken steps to protect these trademarks against infringement and believes that
they will remain available for future use in its business. Sales of remaining
items generally consisted of products carrying the names of other
well-recognized brands.

The Grainger Industrial
Supply catalog offers almost 100,000 MRO products from more than 1,100
suppliers, most of whom are manufacturers. Approximately 1.8 million copies of
the catalog were produced in 2001. The most current edition was issued in
February 2002. The largest supplier in 2001, a diversified manufacturer through
18 of its divisions, accounted for about 9% of Grainger Industrial Supply’s
purchases. No significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to
sources of supply.

The Grainger Industrial
Supply CD-ROM catalog is designed to bring directly to the customer’s place
of business a fast, easy way to select products. Through the CD-ROM catalog, the
customer can use a variety of ways to describe a needed product, and then review
Grainger Industrial Supply’s offerings, complete with specifications,
prices, and pictures. Another CD-ROM catalog feature includes a cross-reference
function that allows customers to retrieve product information using their own
stock numbers. Approximately 1.4 million copies of the CD-ROM catalog were
produced in 2001. The CD-ROM catalog is also used at the branches as a training
tool and resource for helping customers identify appropriate products for their
applications.

Customers can also utilize
Grainger.com, one of the industry’s first MRO websites. This website is an
“e-storefront” or “point of access” into the Grainger
Industrial Supply business. Grainger.com, however, offers more products than the
Grainger Industrial Supply catalog, as well as automated search and customer
personalization. It also is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
providing real-time product availability, customer-specific pricing, multiple
product search capabilities, and linkage to customer support and the fulfillment
system. For large customers interested in connecting to Grainger.com using
sophisticated purchasing platforms, Grainger.com has a universal connection.
This technology translates the different data formats used by electronic
marketplaces, exchanges, and e-procurement systems and allows information from
these systems to be fed directly into Grainger Industrial Supply’s
operating platform.

The Grainger.com site serves as a prominent service channel
for Grainger Industrial Supply. Customers have access to a much larger selection
of MRO products through Grainger.com, which has more than 260,000 products
available. Orders processed through Grainger.com resulted in sales of
approximately $333,000,000 in 2001, $267,000,000 in 2000, and $101,000,000 in
1999.

Acklands-Grainger Inc. (AGI)

AGI, acquired in December
1996, is Canada’s leading broad-line distributor of industrial, fleet, and
safety supplies. It serves customers through 184 branches and six distribution
centers across Canada. AGI distributes tools, lighting, HVAC, safety supplies,
pneumatics, instruments, welding equipment and supplies, motors, and shop
equipment, as well as many other items. A comprehensive catalog, printed in both
English and French, is used to showcase the product line and to help customers
select products. This catalog, with over 70,000 products listed, supports the
efforts of approximately 260 field sales representatives throughout Canada.
During 2001, an average of approximately 18,000 sales transactions were
completed daily. On February 1, 2002, the Company finalized a joint venture
agreement combining AGI’s automotive aftermarket parts division and the
Western Division of Uni-Select Inc., a Canadian distributor of automotive and
industrial supplies. The Company has a 50 percent stake in the new company,
which is managed by Uni-Select.


FindMRO

FindMRO is a sourcing
center for indirect material spot buys. Through sophisticated search
technologies, and the sourcing expertise of its professionals, FindMRO
facilitates the location of MRO products when a source is unknown to the buyer.
With access to a database of more than 8,000 suppliers and 5,000,000 products,
FindMRO sources hard-to-find facilities maintenance supplies for their customers
providing them with a one-stop shopping experience.

Grainger Global Sourcing

Grainger Global Sourcing procures competitively priced, high-quality products
produced outside the United States. These items are sold primarily under private
label by Grainger Industrial Supply and the Company’s other businesses.
Products obtained through Grainger Global Sourcing in 2001 include
WESTWARD® tools and LUMAPRO® lighting products, as well as products
bearing other trademarks.

Grainger Parts

Grainger Parts provides
access to over 440,000 parts and accessories through its centralized warehouse
located in Northbrook, Illinois. Trained representatives have access to more
than 260,000 pages of detailed parts diagrams online. Customers can purchase
over the telephone or online at Grainger.com. Grainger Parts handled about
1,740,000 customer calls in 2001 through its call centers in Northbrook,
Illinois, and Waterloo, Iowa.

Grainger Parts has been ISO 9002 certified since 1995. Grainger Parts' 100% compliance with ISO 9002 standards ranked it
among the top 10% of all ISO-certified companies.

Grainger, S.A. de C.V.

Grainger, S.A. de C.V.
serves the MRO product needs of customers in Mexico. The business employed 51
sales representatives at December 31, 2001. From its five branches, the business
provides delivery of over 70,000 products throughout Mexico. Three new branches
were opened in 2001 in Tijuana, Mexico City, and Puebla. The largest branch, an
80,000 square foot facility, is located outside of Monterrey.

Digital Businesses

In January 2001, the
Company announced it had consolidated three of its digital businesses into a
separate organization. TotalMRO.com, FindMRO, and MROverstocks.com were combined
to create Material Logic, which was designed to allow large customers to access
a single, networked catalog. Material Logic sought funding participation from
other industrial distributors and investors. Economic and market conditions made
it difficult to find funding partners and in April 2001, the Company announced
it was discontinuing the operations of Material Logic. All of Material
Logic’s branded e-commerce sites were shut down with the exception of
FindMRO, which remains as an integrated sourcing service for Grainger’s
customers, under the Branch-based Businesses segment.

Lab Safety Supply, Inc.

Lab Safety Supply is a
direct marketer of safety and other industrial products to U.S. and Canadian
businesses. Located in Janesville, Wisconsin, Lab Safety Supply primarily
reaches its customers through its General Catalog, targeted catalogs, and other
marketing materials, which are distributed throughout the year.

Lab Safety Supply offers
extensive product depth, technical support, and high service levels. It is a
primary safety supplier for many small and medium-sized companies and a critical
backup supplier for many larger companies. Customers have access to over 41,000
products in Lab Safety Supply’s General Catalog. In addition, customers can
access products using a CD-ROM version of the catalog or online via the web at
LabSafety.com. In 2001, Lab Safety Supply acquired The Ben Meadows Co., a $20
million business-to-business direct marketer of equipment for the natural
resources and forestry management market.

Other Businesses

In prior years, the Other Businesses category included a number of operating entities. For 2001, Grainger Integrated
Supply is the only entity in the Other Businesses category.

Grainger Integrated Supply

Grainger Integrated Supply
serves customers who have chosen to outsource components or all of their
indirect materials management processes. The service offering is designed to
enable customers to focus on their core business objectives.

Industry Segments

For 2001 the Company is reporting three industry segments: Branch-based Distribution, Digital, and Lab Safety Supply. For
segment information and the Company's consolidated net sales and operating earnings see "Item 7: Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations," and "Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data." The total year-end assets of the Company for the last five years were: 2001, $2,331,246,000; 2000, $2,459,601,000;
1999, $2,564,826,000; 1998, $2,103,966,000; and 1997, $2,000,116,000.

Competition

The Company faces
competition in all the markets it serves, from manufacturers (including some of
the Company’s own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the
market, from wholesale distributors, from catalog houses, from certain
Internet-based businesses and product fulfillment mechanisms, and from certain
retail enterprises.

The principal means by which the Company competes with
manufacturers and other distributors are by local stock availability, efficient
service, account managers, competitive pricing, its several catalogs, which
include product descriptions and in certain cases, extensive technical and
application data, electronic and Internet commerce technology, and other efforts
to assist customers in lowering their total MRO costs. The Company believes that
it can effectively compete on a price basis with its manufacturing competitors
on small orders, but that such manufacturers may enjoy a cost advantage in
filling large orders.

The Company serves a number
of diverse markets and is able in some markets to reasonably estimate the
Company’s competitive position within that market. However, taken as a
whole, the Company is unable to determine its market share relative to others
engaged in whole or in part in similar activities.

Employees

As of December 31, 2001,
the Company had 15,385 employees, of whom 13,342 were full-time and 2,043 were
part-time or temporary. The Company has never had a major work stoppage and
considers its employee relations generally to be good.

Item 2: Properties

As of
December 31, 2001, the Company’s owned and leased facilities totaled
17,886,000 square feet, an increase of 1.5% over 2000. Grainger Industrial
Supply and Acklands-Grainger Inc. (AGI) accounted for the majority of the total
square footage. Grainger Industrial Supply facilities are located throughout the
United States. AGI facilities are located throughout Canada.

Grainger Industrial Supply
branches range in size from 1,200 to 109,000 square feet and average 20,000
square feet. Most are located in or near major metropolitan areas. Many are in
industrial parks. Typically, a branch is on one floor, is of masonry
construction, consists primarily of warehouse space, contains an air-conditioned
office and sales area, and has off-the-street parking for customers and
employees. The Company considers that its properties are generally in good
condition and well maintained and are suitable and adequate to carry on the
Company’s business.

The significant facilities of the Company are briefly

Company Net Sales-- 2001 Compared to 2000

The Company’s net
sales of $4,754,317,000 for 2001 decreased 4.5% from net sales of $4,977,044,000
for 2000. This decrease resulted from a 5.2% decrease in the Branch-based
Distribution Businesses segment, a 46.2% decrease in the Digital Businesses
segment, and a 1.6% decrease at Lab Safety Supply, partially offset by a 5.5%
increase in the Other Businesses of the Company. The year 2001 had the same
number of sales days as 2000 (255). Sales performance was affected by the
general weakness in the North American economy and worsened by quarter
throughout the year.

Segment Net Sales

The following comments at the segment
level include external and intersegment net sales; those comments at the
business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales. For
segment information see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

Net sales at the
Branch-based Distribution Businesses amounted to $4,251,596,000 in 2001, a 5.2%
decrease as compared with 2000 sales of $4,483,777,000.

Sales in the United
States decreased in 2001 as compared with 2000 primarily due to the recession in
the United States. Also contributing to the decline was a decrease in the sales
of seasonal products due to relatively mild weather in the summer and winter
seasons. Sales to government accounts increased while other categories declined.

Sales were favorably affected by continued momentum in the Company’s
Internet strategy. For 2001, Grainger.com processed sales of approximately
$333,000,000, a 24.7% increase from the $267,000,000 processed in 2000.

In
Canada, average daily sales decreased 2.8% in 2001 as compared with 2000. This
decrease was driven primarily by an unfavorable Canadian exchange rate. In local
currency, average daily sales increased 1.3% in 2001 as compared with 2000. The
growth in Canada was driven primarily by an improvement in the oil and gas
sector of the economy, partially offset by the impact of the weakness in other
sectors of the Canadian economy. The Company’s Canadian operations also
experienced a negative sales trend with sales declining in the second half of
the year on a comparative basis with 2000.

In Mexico, average daily sales
decreased 17.0% in 2001 as compared with 2000. This sales performance reflects
the weakness in the automotive and electronics manufacturing industries,
deterioration of the Mexican economy, along with the impact of the recession in
the United States.

Digital Businesses

Net sales at the Digital
Businesses amounted to $29,979,000 in 2001, a 46.2% decrease as compared with
2000 sales of $55,683,000. Net sales for this segment represented product sales
and service fee revenues for FindMRO and service fee revenues for the rest of
Material Logic.

On April 23, 2001, the
Company announced that it would shut down the operations of Material Logic with
the exception of FindMRO. In connection with this announcement, the Company took
a pretax, non-recurring charge of $39.1 million in 2001. FindMRO was then
established as an operating unit separate from Material Logic. Effective June 1,
2001, FindMRO was added to the Branch-based Distribution Businesses. Beginning
with the 2001 third quarter, the Digital Businesses segment ceased operations.
For additional information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Lab Safety Supply

Net sales at Lab Safety Supply amounted to $324,797,000 in
2001, a 1.6% decrease compared with 2000 sales of $330,108,000. Lab Safety
Supply’s sales included the results of The Ben Meadows Co., an acquisition
made in the 2001 first quarter. Excluding the sales of The Ben Meadows Co., 2001
sales would have been down 6.2% when compared with 2000, primarily the result of
weak sales in the nation’s industrial sector.

Other Businesses

Net sales at the Other
Businesses amounted to $190,811,000 in 2001, a 5.5% increase over 2000 sales of
$180,852,000. Sales growth for this group of businesses was primarily related to
a strong sales increase at Grainger Integrated Supply. Sales for this business
unit included product sales and management fees.

Company Net Sales-- 2000 Compared to 1999

The Company’s net
sales of $4,977,044,000 for 2000 increased 7.4% from net sales of $4,636,275,000
for 1999. This increase resulted from a 6.5% increase in the Branch-based
Distribution Businesses segment, a 1,769.2% increase in the Digital Businesses
segment, a 5.3% increase at Lab Safety Supply, and a 43.7% increase in the Other
Businesses of the Company. The year 2000 had one more sales day than did 1999
(255 versus 254). On a daily basis the Company’s net sales increased 6.9%.


Sales growth for 2000 was
primarily volume driven, reflecting growth in the Branch-based Businesses,
especially in Canada and Mexico; strong growth at Grainger Integrated Supply;
and continued strong growth in sales processed through the Company’s
Internet sites.

Sales processed through the Company's Internet businesses, as represented by the Digital segment plus Grainger.com,
amounted to $337,000,000 in 2000, a 230% increase as compared with $102,000,000 for the year 1999.

The Company's sales growth during the fourth quarter of 2000 was negatively affected by a slowing economy.

Segment Net Sales

The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales; those comments at the business
unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales. For segment information see Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

Net sales at the
Branch-based Distribution Businesses amounted to $4,483,777,000 in 2000, a 6.5%
increase over 1999 sales of $4,211,316,000. Average daily sales increased by
6.1%.

The Company’s Canadian operations experienced double-digit sales
growth. The growth was the result of strong sales across most of Canada. The
growth was driven by an improvement in the oil and gas, forestry, and mining
sectors of the Canadian economy, gains in large customer accounts, and the
opening of 10 new branches during 1999.

The Company’s Mexican operations
experienced double-digit sales growth reflecting the continued development of
this business. This growth in sales was attributable to an expanded product
offering and account penetration. In January 2000, the Company opened a second
branch in Mexico.

Sales growth in the United States was driven by improved sales at Grainger Industrial Supply. Contributing to the sales
growth were 35 new branches opened during 1999 and 2000. Also contributing to the sales growth was increased sales to
government accounts.

Sales were also favorably
affected by continued momentum in the Company’s Internet initiative. Sales
orders processed through Grainger.com amounted to $267,000,000 in 2000, a 164%
increase over 1999 sales of $101,000,000.

Partially offsetting this growth was
the impact of a 20% decline in third quarter sales of seasonal products
resulting from relatively mild weather in the more heavily populated areas of
the United States. Also, sales growth during the fourth quarter of 2000 was
negatively affected by a slowing economy.

Digital Businesses

Net sales at the Digital
Businesses amounted to $55,683,000 in 2000, a significant increase over 1999
sales of $2,979,000. Sales for this group of businesses include product sales
and service fee revenues for FindMRO and service fee revenues for
MROverstocks.com (formerly Grainger Auction) and TotalMRO.com. FindMRO and
MROverstocks.com were officially launched in November 1999. TotalMRO.com opened
for business on March 31, 2000.

Lab Safety Supply

Net sales at Lab Safety
Supply amounted to $330,108,000, a 5.3% increase over 1999 sales of
$313,533,000. This increase reflects the continued growth in sales of industrial
products and expanded market share attained through new customers and further
penetration of existing accounts. Partially offsetting this increase was a
decline in sales of safety products resulting from a slowing of the industrial
economy in the United States.

Other Businesses

Net sales at the Other
Businesses amounted to $180,852,000 in 2000, a 43.7% increase over 1999 sales of
$125,882,000.

Sales growth for this group of businesses was primarily related to
a strong sales increase at Grainger Integrated Supply. Sales for this business
unit include product sales and management fees. Growth was driven by new
engagements, contract renewals, and scope expansions, reflecting increasing
demand for this outsourcing business, which provides fee-based, on-site indirect
materials management services to large businesses.

Company Net Earnings-- 2001 Compared to 2000

The Company’s net
earnings of $174,530,000 for 2001 decreased 9.5% compared with 2000 net earnings
of $192,903,000. The Company’s earnings per share for the year declined
10.2% to $1.84 in 2001 from $2.05 in 2000. The results for 2001 included a
non-recurring, after-tax charge of $36,650,000, or $0.39 per share. The results
for 2000 included an after-tax gain of $17,860,000, or $0.19 per share, related
to sales of investment securities. Excluding these non-recurring items from both
periods, net earnings increased 20.6% to $211,180,000 in 2001 from $175,043,000
in 2000 and earnings per share increased 19.9% to $2.23 in 2001 from $1.86 in
2000.


Segment Operating Earnings

The following comments at
the segment level include external and intersegment operating earnings; those
comments at the business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment
operating earnings. For segment information see Note 19 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

Operating earnings of $386,331,000 declined 2.7% in 2001 as compared with $397,252,000 for 2000. Lower sales and an
increase in operating expenses contributed to the decline in operating earnings, partially offset by a higher gross
profit margin.

Operating expenses
increased 1.9% in 2001 versus 2000. Operating expenses increased due to higher
occupancy expenses, including the effect of start-up costs relating to the
opening of two new distribution centers, increased data processing expenses and
increased employee benefits costs. These factors were partially offset by lower
travel and entertainment expenses and lower advertising expenses.

The gross profit margin was affected by selected pricing actions in 2001 intended to cover freight and supplier cost
increases, and lower sales of seasonal products. Historically, the sales of seasonal products have lower than average
gross profit margins.

Digital Businesses

On April 23, 2001, the
Company announced that it would shut down the operations of Material Logic with
the exception of FindMRO. In connection with this announcement, the Company took
a pretax, non-recurring charge of $39,070,000 in 2001. FindMRO was then
established as an operating unit separate from Material Logic. Effective June 1,
2001, FindMRO was added to the Branch-based Distribution Businesses. Beginning
with the 2001 third quarter, the Digital Businesses segment ceased operations.

The Digital Businesses
incurred operating losses of $49,227,000 in 2001 which included the
non-recurring charge of $39,070,000 mentioned above. This compares with
operating losses of $48,207,000 in 2000. For additional information, see Note 3
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Lab Safety Supply

Operating earnings of
$51,114,000 decreased 7.1% in 2001 as compared with $55,037,000 for 2000. The
decrease in operating earnings was impacted by the decline in net sales and an
increase in payroll and employee benefits costs, and increased data processing
costs.

Other Businesses

The Other Businesses
achieved operating income of $449,000 in 2001 compared with operating losses of
$13,257,000 in 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to improved
operating results at Grainger Integrated Supply. These results were achieved by
eliminating or renegotiating unprofitable contracts and by reducing its cost
structure through improved productivity.

Other Income Statement Data

Other income or deductions included the following non-recurring items:

1.

In 2001, a $25,123,000 loss relating to investments in digital enterprises.

2.

In 2000, a gain of $30,017,000 from the sale of investment securities.

Excluding the non-recurring items from both periods, the year 2001 had a net deduction of $16,170,000 versus a net
deduction of $33,542,000 in the comparable 2000 period. The difference was primarily attributable to lower interest
expense.

The Company's effective tax rate was 41.3% and 41.8% in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The rate decrease in 2001 as
compared with 2000 was primarily due to the following two items, which lowered the effective tax rate for 2001 when
compared with 2000:

1.

Lower amounts of losses in unconsolidated entities; and

2.

The tax impact of the write-off of investments in unconsolidated entities, which had tax benefits disproportionate
to the loss incurred.

These items were partially offset by the tax impact of capital losses which are not deductible in the absence of capital
gains.

Excluding the effect of these items, the effective tax rate was 40.5% for both 2001 and 2000.


Company Net Earnings-- 2000 Compared to 1999

The Company's net earnings of $192,903,000 for 2000 increased 6.7% as compared with 1999 net earnings of $180,731,000.
This increase resulted from higher operating earnings and lower other deductions, partially offset by a higher effective
income tax rate.

Operating earnings improved at the Branch-based Distribution Businesses and at Lab Safety Supply. Also, the operating
losses at the Other Businesses decreased. These improvements were partially offset by the increased operating losses at
the Digital Businesses.

Segment Operating Earnings

The following comments at
the segment level include external and intersegment operating earnings; those
comments at the business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment
operating earnings. For segment information see Note 19 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

Operating earnings at the
Branch-based Distribution Businesses amounted to $397,252,000 in 2000, an 11.0%
increase over 1999 operating earnings of $357,925,000. This improvement in
operating earnings was greater than the sales increase because operating
expenses grew at a slower rate than the growth in sales, partially offset by
lower gross profit margins.

Operating expenses increased 2%, primarily the
result of productivity improvements. Partially offsetting these improvements
were higher data processing expenses (including increased depreciation,
amortization, and systems maintenance costs) and increased bad debt provisions.

Gross profit margins decreased 0.67 percentage point as compared to 1999. Of note are the following factors affecting the
gross profit margin:

1.

Grainger Industrial Supply's gross profit margin declined. This decline was primarily due to an unfavorable change
in selling price category mix resulting from increased sales of sourced products
and to higher freight costs. The above factors were partially offset by selected
price increases during the 2000 third quarter. The price increases were intended
to recover freight and supplier cost increases.

2.

Acklands-Grainger Inc. had a lower gross profit margin primarily due to an unfavorable change in selling price
category mix as a result of increased sales to large customers.

Digital Businesses

The Digital Businesses incurred operating losses of $48,207,000 in 2000 compared with operating losses of $20,560,000 in
1999. During 2000 the Company continued to invest in developing, enhancing, operating, and marketing these digital
businesses.

Total operating expenses associated with the Company's Internet initiatives, as represented by this segment plus
Grainger.com (which is included in the Branch-based Distribution Businesses segment), were $108,000,000 in 2000 as
compared with $42,000,000 in 1999.

On August 1, 2000, the
Company combined OrderZone.com with Works.com, a leading Internet purchasing
service. This combination was designed to provide small and mid-size businesses
with online purchasing services for indirect business products. The Company
received a 40% interest in the combined entity and recognized a proportionate
share of earnings or losses as part of Other Deductions.

On January 26, 2001, the
Company announced the consolidation of FindMRO, MROverstocks.com, and
TotalMRO.com into a separate organization, Material Logic. Participation was
sought from MRO distributors to establish Material Logic as an industry-backed,
industry-funded independent entity that would own and operate these businesses.
Material Logic was also expected to include related consulting, implementation,
and content services.

Lab Safety Supply

Operating earnings at Lab
Safety Supply amounted to $55,037,000 in 2000, a 28.4% increase over 1999
operating earnings of $42,878,000. This increase resulted from improved
operating performance and the elimination of expenses related to certain fully
amortized intangibles.

Other Businesses

The Other Businesses of the
Company incurred operating losses of $13,257,000 in 2000 compared with operating
losses of $16,306,000 in 1999. The lower operating losses for this group of
companies was a function of improved performance at all of the businesses
grouped under this caption, including Grainger Integrated Supply.


Other Income Statement Data

Interest expense of
$24,403,000 for 2000 increased by $8,807,000 as compared with 1999. This
increase resulted from higher average borrowings, higher average interest rates
paid on all outstanding debt, and lower capitalized interest.

The equity in
losses of unconsolidated entities (after tax) primarily related to the
Company’s interest in Works.com, which was acquired during the 2000 third
quarter.

Unclassified—net
income for 2000 was $29,842,000 versus $512,000 for 1999. The year 2000 included
a $30,017,000 gain from the sales of investment securities.

The Company’s
effective income tax rate was 41.8% for 2000 and 40.5% for 1999. The increase in
the effective income tax rate relates to the loss on equity interest in
unconsolidated entities, which is a net of tax number. Excluding the effect of
these joint venture losses, the effective income tax rate was 40.5% for both
years.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Working capital was
$838,800,000 at December 31, 2001, compared with $735,678,000 at December 31,
2000, and $600,611,000 at December 31, 1999. The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities was 2.5, 2.0, and 1.7, at such dates.

Net cash flows from
operations of $510,794,000 in 2001, $277,757,000 in 2000, and $37,240,000 in
1999, have continued to improve the Company’s financial position and serve
as the primary source of funding for capital requirements. For information as to
the Company’s cash flows, see “Item 8: Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.”

In each of the past three years, a portion of working
capital has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment, and
capitalized software as summarized in the following table.

The Company repurchased
1,820,000 shares of its common stock during 2001, 31,400 shares of its common
stock during 2000, and 355,300 shares of its common stock during 1999. As of
December 31, 2001, approximately 3,500,000 shares of common stock remained
available under the Company’s repurchase authorization.

Dividends paid to
shareholders were $65,445,000 in 2001, $62,863,000 in 2000, and $58,817,000 in
1999.

Internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital
and funds needed for expanding the business, supplemented by debt as
circumstances dictated. In addition to continuing facilities optimization
efforts, business development, and systems and other infrastructure
enhancements, funds are being expended to enhance the Company’s Internet
initiatives.

The Company maintains a
debt ratio and liquidity position that provide flexibility in funding working
capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally
generated funds, the Company has various sources of financing available,
including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit and
otherwise. Total debt as a percent of Shareholders’ Equity was 8%, 21%, and
30% at December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Inflation during the last
three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use
of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and
accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes
result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the primary
financial statements.

The major impact of inflation is on buildings and
improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues
to be significant for these long-lived assets. The related depreciation expense
associated with these assets increases significantly when adjusting for the
cumulative effect of inflation.

The Company believes the
most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors
lies in continued application of basic business principles, which include
improving productivity, increasing working capital turnover, and offering
products and services which can command appropriate price levels in the
marketplace.


FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Throughout this Form 10-K
are forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. The
forward-looking statements relate to the Company’s expected future
financial results and business plans, strategies, and objectives and are not
historical facts. They are often identified by qualifiers such as:
“will,” “intended,” “is transitioning,” or similar
expressions. There are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause
the Company’s results to differ materially from what is projected.

Factors that may affect
forward-looking statements include the following: higher product costs or other
expenses; a major loss of customers; increased competitive pricing pressure on
the Company’s businesses; failure to develop or implement new technologies
or other business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation and
governmental proceedings; changes in laws and regulations; facilities
disruptions or shutdowns, natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather
conditions; and other difficulties in achieving or improving margins or
financial performance.

Trends and projections could also be affected by general
industry and market conditions, gross domestic product growth rates, general
economic conditions, including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations,
global and other conflicts, and other factors.

Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The Company is exposed to
foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions, assets, and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company partially hedges the
net Canadian dollar investment of its Canadian subsidiary with borrowings
denominated in Canadian dollars. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding this Canadian dollar denominated
financing. For 2001, a uniform 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar
relative to foreign currencies in which the Company’s sales are made would
not have had a material effect on net income. This sensitivity analysis of the
effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in
potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices.

The Company also is exposed
to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio. All of the Company’s long-term
debt at December 31, 2001, is variable rate debt. See Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for the maturity schedule of the debt
outstanding as of December 31, 2001. For 2001, a one percentage point increase
in interest rates paid by the Company would result in a decrease in net income
of approximately $0.9 million. This sensitivity analysis of the effects of
changes in interest rates on long-term debt does not factor in potential changes
in exchange rates or long-term debt levels.

The Company is not exposed to commodity price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase
commodities directly.

Supplementary Data on page 17.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

Shareholders and Board of Directors

W.W. Grainger, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of W.W. Grainger,
Inc., and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders’
equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of W.W. Grainger, Inc.,
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the years then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

We
have also audited Schedule II of W.W. Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999. In our opinion, this Schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be set
forth therein.

W.W. Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INDUSTRY INFORMATION

The Company is engaged in the distribution of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) supplies, services, and related
information to businesses and institutions in North America.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.

INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

For investments in which the Company owns or controls from 20 percent to 50 percent of the voting shares, the equity
method of accounting is used. The Company also accounts for investments below 20 percent using the equity method when
significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee company can be exercised for those
investments. (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in the 2000 and 1999 financial statements, as previously reported, have been reclassified to conform to
the 2001 presentation.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

In preparing financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, management is required to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

The financial statements of
the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are generally measured using the local
currency as the functional currency. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from
the translation of financial statements of foreign operations, and related
long-term debt, except for those from highly inflationary economies, are
recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at
the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined primarily by the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. For non-LIFO inventories, cost is determined by the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

COST OF MERCHANDISE SOLD

Cost of merchandise sold
includes product costs and product related costs, freight-out costs, and
handling costs. The Company defines handling costs as those costs incurred to
fulfill a shipped sales order.

PROPERTY, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT

Property, buildings, and equipment are valued at cost.

For financial statement purposes, depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of
depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives, principally on the declining-balance and
sum-of-the-years-digits methods. The principal estimated useful lives used in determining depreciation are as follows:

Buildings, structures, and improvements...........................................      10 to 45 years

Furniture, fixtures, machinery, and equipment.....................................      3 to 10 years

Improvements to leased property are amortized over the initial terms of the respective leases or the estimated service
lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.

The Company capitalized interest costs of $1,323,000, $747,000, and $3,238,000, in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the
asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues recognized include
product sales, billings for freight and handling charges, and fees earned for
services provided. The Company recognizes product sales and billings for freight
and handling charges on the date products are shipped. Fee revenues are
recognized on the date services are completed.


INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are recognized
during the year in which transactions enter into the determination of financial
statement income, with deferred taxes being provided for temporary differences
between financial and tax reporting.

PURCHASED TAX BENEFITS

The Company purchased tax
benefits through leases as provided by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.
Realized tax benefits, net of repayments, are included in Deferred Income Taxes.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE EARNINGS

The Company’s other comprehensive earnings
include unrealized gains on investments, net of tax, and foreign currency
translation adjustments with no related income tax effects. The cumulative
amount of other comprehensive (loss) earnings was $(29,553,000), $(18,832,000),
and $68,791,000, at December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD

The Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, “Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” effective January
1, 2001. The Company uses non-derivative financial instruments to help hedge its
exposure for certain investments in foreign subsidiaries in which the net assets
are exposed to currency exchange rate volatility. Adoption of SFAS No. 133
requires the Company to report the net amounts of gains and losses that arise
from qualifying non-derivative hedging instruments in the cumulative translation
adjustment during the reporting period. The Company’s accounting treatment
of SFAS No. 133 is consistent with the method it previously used under SFAS No.
52, “Foreign Currency Translation.”

Currency exposure related to the
Company’s investment in the net assets of its Canadian subsidiary,
Acklands-Grainger Inc. (AGI), is partially mitigated by a foreign currency
denominated debt obligation of the parent. Gains and losses associated with the
debt obligation offset gains and losses in the net investment in AGI.

The amount
of gain (loss) related to the foreign currency denominated debt obligation for
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 was $7,039,000, $4,550,000,
and $(7,028,000), respectively, and were included in accumulated other
comprehensive earnings.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On July 20, 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Intangible
Assets.” SFAS No. 141 is effective for all business combinations completed
after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001; however, certain provisions of this Statement apply to
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired between July 1, 2001, and the
effective date of SFAS No. 142. Major provisions of these Statements and their
effective dates for the Company are as follows:

1.

All business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001 must use the purchase method of accounting. The
pooling of interest method of accounting is prohibited except for transactions initiated before July 1, 2001.

2.

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recorded separately from goodwill if they arise from contractual
or other legal rights or are separable from the acquired entity and can be sold,
transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or as part of a
related contract, asset, or liability.

3.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, acquired after June
30, 2001, are not amortized. Effective January 1, 2002, all previously
recognized goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer
be subject to amortization.

4.

Effective January 1, 2002, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
will be tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an impairment
indicated.

5.

All acquired goodwill must be assigned to reporting units for purposes
of impairment testing and
segment reporting.

At December 31, 2001, goodwill had a net carrying value of
$150 million. In 2001, amortization expense for goodwill was $3,192,000
after-tax, or $0.03 per share. The Company is currently evaluating the
classification of other intangibles and the effect of impairment provisions of
SFAS No. 142 and is in the process of assessing the impact of adoption on its
consolidated financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001, and addresses financial accounting and reporting for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This statement supersedes SFAS
No. 121 “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,” and the accounting and reporting
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the
Results of Operations – Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions,” for the disposal of a segment of a business. The Company
plans to adopt SFAS No. 144 at January 1, 2002, and has determined that adoption
will not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial
position.


NOTE 2--BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On February 26, 2001, Lab
Safety Supply, Inc., the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, acquired The
Ben Meadows Co., Inc. (Ben Meadows), of Canton, Georgia, for approximately $14.4
million, including costs associated with the acquisition.

Ben Meadows, a
privately held corporation with annual sales of $20,000,000, is a
business-to-business direct marketer specializing in equipment and supplies for
the environmental and forestry management markets. The acquisition was accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting. Results for Ben Meadows are
included in the Company’s results since the date of its acquisition. Given
the size of the acquisition, pro forma disclosures are not considered necessary.

NOTE 3--NON-RECURRING CHARGES

On April 23, 2001, the
Company announced its plans to shut down the operations of Material Logic and
write down its investment in other digital activities. Material Logic was the
business unit the Company formed to seek other equity participants in developing
several digital operations. As a result of this action, the Company shut down
all of Material Logic’s branded e-commerce sites except FindMRO, which
remains an integrated sourcing service for the Company’s customers.

In
connection with the closing of Material Logic, the Company took a non-recurring,
pretax charge of $39.1 million (after-tax $23.2 million) in 2001. The Company
provided a comprehensive separation package, including outplacement services, to
the employees whose jobs were eliminated. As part of the shutdown, 166 employees
were severed. Severance payments began in July 2001 and will continue until June
2004, when the last severance package expires.

In addition, the Company wrote
down its investment in other digital enterprises and took a pretax charge of
$25.1 million (after-tax $13.4 million). This included the loss on the
divestiture of the Company’s 40% investment in Works.com, Inc. The Company
acquired its ownership in Works.com, Inc., an unrelated third party, on August
1, 2000, when the Company’s OrderZone.com business unit was combined with
Works.com.

The total effect of these
non-recurring charges amounted to an after-tax cost of $36.6 million, or $0.39
per share.

The following table displays the activity and balance of the Material
Logic restructuring reserve as of December 31, 2001:

Deductions reflect cash
payments of $17,597,000 and noncash charges of $11,996,000. The amounts in the
adjustments column are reclassifications and reductions to reflect
management’s current estimate of costs, by expense category.

NOTE 4--CASH FLOWS

The Company considers
investments in highly liquid debt instruments, purchased with an original
maturity of ninety days or less, to be cash equivalents. For cash equivalents,
the carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these
instruments.

NOTE 5--CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company places temporary cash investments with institutions of high credit quality and, by policy, limits the amount
of credit exposure to any one institution.

The Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries doing business in all regions
of the United States as well as other areas of North America. Consequently, no significant concentration of credit risk
is considered to exist.


NOTE 6--INVENTORIES

Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale.

Inventories would have been
$202,390,000, $211,801,000, and $211,490,000, higher than reported at December
31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, if the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method
of inventory accounting had been used for all Company inventories. Net earnings
would have (decreased) increased by $(5,741,000), $188,000, and $(3,603,000),
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, using the
FIFO method of accounting. Inventories under FIFO approximate replacement cost.

NOTE 7--INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

During 2001 and 2000, the
Company made investments in several Internet related start-up joint ventures.

On August 1, 2000, the
Company completed a transaction that combined the assets of its OrderZone.com
business with Works.com. In addition, the Company invested $21 million in cash
in Works.com and agreed to make Works.com’s purchasing management service
and marketplace available to the Company’s small and mid-size customers
through Grainger.com. For its contributions, the Company received a 40% equity
stake in the combined company, which was subject to certain voting and transfer
restrictions. Subsequent to August 1, 2000, the Company accounted for its
interest in Works.com using the equity method. Prior to August 1, 2000, the
results of OrderZone.com were included in the consolidated results of the
Company. In the second quarter of 2001, the Company divested its 40% ownership share of Works.com (See Note 3 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The Company also made investments in
three other joint ventures. The Company accounts for these joint ventures using
the equity method of accounting. The Company’s ownership percentages range
from 11% to 49%. As start-up businesses, the time frame or the ultimate ability
to achieve profitability is uncertain. Reaching profitability is also dependent
upon the entities securing sufficient capital funding to support developmental
activities.

The table below summarizes the activity of these investments. The losses reflect the start-up nature of these businesses.

NOTE 8--INTANGIBLES

Goodwill represents the
cost in excess of net assets of acquired companies and was amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods of five to forty years. The Company’s
goodwill is predominately denominated in Canadian dollars and, accordingly, the
changes in the asset balance are due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

Customer lists and other intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods of seven to forty years.

Beginning in 2002, goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be tested for
impairment on an annual basis. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements— “New Accounting Pronouncements.”)

NOTE 9--INVESTMENTS

Investments consist of marketable securities and non-publicly
traded equity securities for which a market value is not readily determinable.
Marketable securities are all classified as available-for-sale and are reported
at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses on such securities reflected, net
of taxes, as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Non-publicly
traded equity securities are reported at lower of cost or estimated net
realizable value. Adjustments to net realizable value are recognized in
earnings. There have been no dividends earned on these investments. During 2001
and 2000, the Company sold a portion of its marketable securities investments.
The gains on these sales were calculated using the specific identification
method and were reported in Unclassified—net.


The original cost, realized and unrealized gains (pretax), and fair value of investments are summarized as follows:

NOTE 12--EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

RETIREMENT PLANS. A
majority of the Company’s employees are covered by a noncontributory profit
sharing plan. This plan provides for annual employer contributions based upon a
formula related primarily to earnings before federal income taxes, limited to
15% of the total compensation paid to all eligible employees. The Company also
sponsors additional defined contribution and defined benefit plans, which cover
most of the other employees. Provisions under all plans were $47,621,000,
$42,353,000, and $55,007,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and
1999, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. The Company has a health care
benefits plan that provides coverage to its retired employees and their
dependents should they elect to maintain such coverage. A majority of the
Company’s employees become eligible for participation when they qualify for
retirement while working for the Company.


The amounts charged to
operating expense for postretirement health care benefits were $5,348,000,
$3,767,000, and $4,523,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and
1999, respectively. Components of the expense were:

Participation in the plan
is voluntary at retirement and requires participants to make contributions
toward the cost of the plan, as determined by the Company. The accounting for
the health plan anticipates future cost-sharing changes to retiree contributions
that will maintain the current cost-sharing ratio between the Company and the
retirees.

A Group Benefit Trust has been established as the vehicle to process
benefit payments. The assets of the trust are invested in Standard &
Poor’s 500 index funds. The assumed weighted average long-term rate of
return is 6%, which is net of a 40.0% tax rate. The funding of the trust is an
estimated amount which is intended to allow the maximum deductible contribution
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and was $3,470,000,
$1,385,000, and $1,686,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and
1999, respectively.

To determine the APBO as of
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, the assumed weighted average discount rate
used was 7.0%, 7.5%, and 7.8%, respectively. The assumed health care cost trend
rate for 2002 is 8.1%. Beginning in 2003, the assumed health care cost trend
rate declines on a straight-line basis until 2011, when the ultimate trend rate
of 5.0% is achieved.


If the assumed health care
cost trend rate increased by one percentage point for each year, the APBO as of
December 31, 2001, would increase by $11,871,000. The aggregate of the service
cost and interest cost components of the 2001 net periodic postretirement
benefits expense would increase by $1,644,000.

If the assumed health care
cost trend rate decreased by one percentage point for each year, the APBO as of
December 31, 2001, would decrease by $9,485,000. The aggregate of the service
cost and interest cost components of the 2001 net periodic postretirement
benefits expense would decrease by $1,277,000.

As part of the permanent
financing for a Canadian Subsidiary, the Company maintained a $113,324,000
uncommitted revolving credit facility, denominated in Canadian dollars. The
Company had $113,324,000 outstanding at December 31, 2001, relating to this
facility with an interest rate of 3.52%. The Company has the intent and the
ability to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis through its credit
lines and, therefore, it is included in long-term debt.

The industrial
development revenue bonds include various issues that bear interest at variable
rates up to 15%, or variable rates up to 78.2% of the prime rate, and come due
in various amounts from 2002 through 2021. Interest rates on some of the issues
are subject to change at certain dates in the future. The bondholders may
require the Company to redeem certain bonds concurrent with a change in interest
rates and certain other bonds annually. In addition, $10,620,000 of these bonds
had an unsecured liquidity facility available at December 31, 2001, for which
the Company compensated a bank through a commitment fee of 0.07%. There were no
borrowings related to this facility at December 31, 2001. The Company classified
$12,520,000 of bonds currently subject to redemption options in current
maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2001. The Company classified
$22,755,000 and $27,650,000 of bonds subject to redemption options in current
maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The
aggregate amounts of long-term debt maturing in each of the five years

Total rent expense, including both items under lease and items rented on a month-to-month basis, was $18,837,000,
$20,759,000, and $19,383,000 for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

NOTE 15--STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

The Company maintains stock incentive plans under which the Company may grant a variety of incentive awards to employees.
A maximum of 14,056,828 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the plans in connection with awards of
non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, phantom stock rights, and other stock-based
awards.

The plans authorize the granting of options to purchase shares at a price of not less than 100% of the closing market
price on the last trading day preceding the date of grant. The options expire no later than ten years after the date of
grant.

Shares relating to
terminated, surrendered or canceled options and stock appreciation rights, to
forfeited restricted stock or other awards, or to transactions that result in
fewer shares being issued under the plans, are again available for awards under
the plans.

In 2001, a broad-based
stock option grant covering 764,400 shares was made to employees who had a
minimum of five years of service and who were not participants in other stock
option programs.

The plans authorize the granting of restricted stock, which is
held by the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions related to the
applicable grants. Except for the right of disposal, holders of restricted stock
have full shareholders’ rights during the period of restriction, including
voting rights and the right to receive dividends.

There were 247,275 shares of
restricted stock issued in 2001 with a weighted average fair market value of
$33.30 per share. There were 367,500 shares of restricted stock issued in 2000
with a weighted average fair market value of $41.90 per share. There were 42,000
shares of restricted stock issued in 1999 with a weighted average fair market
value of $45.26 per share. The shares vest over periods from two to ten years
from issuance, although accelerated vesting is provided in certain instances.
Restricted stock released totaled 87,000, 5,000, and 0 shares in 2001, 2000, and
1999, respectively. Compensation expense related to restricted stock awards is
based upon market prices at the date of grant and is charged to earnings on a
straight-line basis over the period of restriction. Total compensation expense
related to restricted stock was $8,916,000, $6,301,000, and $2,178,000 in 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively. In 2001, $2,220,000 of restricted stock
compensation expense related to the 2001 digital business restructuring was
included in restructuring charges.


On March 26, 2001, a group
of 83 executive officers and other key managers bought 787,020 treasury shares
from the Company at the then-current market price of the shares. Cash proceeds
from the sale, which amounted to $24,366,000, were used by the Company to
repurchase shares of the Company’s stock on the open market. Executives who
met a threshold purchase requirement of one times their annual base salary
received a 25% matching grant of restricted stock that will vest if they remain
with the Company and hold their purchased shares for a minimum of two years. The
grant totaled 192,275 shares of restricted stock. Most executives financed their
purchases through loans arranged with a local bank. Those executives are
responsible for repaying their loans. The Company entered into a Note Purchase
Agreement with the bank, agreeing to purchase the loan of any defaulting
executive.

During 1997, the Company
adopted a Director Stock Plan in which non-employee directors participate. A
total of 500,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the
plan.

A retainer fee for Board service is paid to non-employee directors in the
form of an annual award under the Director Stock Plan of unrestricted shares of
common stock. The number of shares is equal to the retainer fee divided by the
fair market value of a share of common stock at the time of the award, rounded
up to the next 10-share increment. Total shares granted were 8,130, 6,480, and
4,680 in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

Additionally, non-employee
directors receive under the Director Stock Plan an annual grant, denominated in
dollars, of options to purchase shares of common stock. The number of shares
covered by each option is equal to the award divided by the fair market value of
a share of common stock at the time of the award, rounded to the next 10-share
increment. The per-share option exercise price is 100% of the fair market value
of the shares. The options are fully exercisable upon award and have a ten-year
term. Total options granted covered 19,200, 16,560, and 16,740 shares in 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively.

The Company awards stock
units under the Director Stock Plan in connection with deferrals of director
fees and dividend equivalents on existing stock units. A stock unit is
essentially the economic equivalent of a share of common stock. Deferred fees
and dividend equivalents on existing stock units are converted into stock units
on the basis of the market value of the stock at the relevant time. Payment of
the value of stock units generally is made after the termination of service as a
director. As of December 31, 2001, ten directors held stock units. As of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, nine directors held stock units. The Company
recognized expense for stock units of $419,000, $426,000, and $300,000 for 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively. Total stock units outstanding were 45,844, 45,765,
and 43,219 as of December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

Transactions involving stock options are summarized as follows:

The purchased tax benefits represent lease agreements acquired in prior years under the provisions of the
Economic Recovery Act of 1981.

At December 31, 2001, the Company has approximately $28,000,000 of foreign operating loss carryforwards related to a
foreign operation, which begin to expire in 2004. The valuation allowance represents a provision for uncertainty as to
the realization of these carryforwards. In addition, the Company recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated
amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to capital loss carryforward limitations. The changes in the
valuation allowance were as follows:

NOTE 18--ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

The Company adopted a
Shareholder Rights Plan, under which there is outstanding one preferred share
purchase right (Right) for each outstanding share of the Company’s common
stock. Each Right, under certain circumstances, may be exercised to purchase one
one-hundredth of a share of Series A-1999 Junior Participating Preferred Stock
(intended to be the economic equivalent of one share of the Company’s
common stock) at a price of $250.00, subject to adjustment. The Rights become
exercisable only after a person or a group, other than a person or group exempt
under the plan, acquires or announces a tender offer for 15% or more of the
Company’s common stock. If a person or group, other than a person or group
exempt under the plan, acquires 15% or more of the Company’s common stock
or if the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination
transaction, each Right generally entitles the holder, other than such person or
group, to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, stock and/or other
securities or assets of the Company or the acquiring company having a market
value of twice the exercise price.

The Rights expire on May
15, 2009, unless earlier redeemed. They generally are redeemable at $.001 per
Right until thirty days following announcement that a person or group, other
than a person or group exempt under the plan, has acquired 15% or more of the
Company’s common stock. The Rights do not have voting or dividend rights
and, until they become exercisable, have no dilutive effect on the earnings of
the Company.


NOTE 19--SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company has three
reported segments: Branch-based Distribution, Digital, and Lab Safety Supply.
The Branch-based Distribution segment provides customers with solutions to their
immediate MRO needs. Branch-based Distribution is an aggregation of the
following business segments: Grainger Industrial Supply, Acklands-Grainger Inc.
(Canada), FindMRO, Grainger.com, Grainger Export, Grainger Global Sourcing,
Grainger Parts, Grainger, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico) and Grainger Caribe Inc. (Puerto
Rico). The Digital segment provided e-commerce solutions to customers’ MRO
and other needs. The Digital segment was an aggregation of the FindMRO,
MROverstocks.com, and TotalMRO.com business segments. During 2001, the Company
shut down its digital operations except for FindMRO, which became part of the
Branch-based Distribution Segment. (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.) Lab Safety Supply is a direct marketer of safety and other
industrial products. In prior years the Other Businesses category included a
number of operating entities. For 2001, Grainger Integrated Supply is the only
entity in the Other Businesses category.

The Company’s segments
offer differing ranges of services and/or products and require different
resources and marketing strategies. The accounting policies of the segments are
the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
Intersegment transfer prices are established at external selling prices, less
costs not incurred due to the related party sale.

In 2001, the Company
recorded non-recurring charges relating to the shutdown of its Material Logic
business unit and other restructuring charges. (See Note 3 to Consolidated
Financial Statements.)


NOTE 21--SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On February 1, 2002, the
Company finalized a joint venture agreement with Uni-Select Inc., a Canadian
company, which was previously announced on October 1, 2001. The joint venture
combined Uni-Select’s Western Division with the automotive aftermarket
division of Acklands-Grainger Inc. (AGI), which operates as Bumper to Bumper.
AGI is a Canadian subsidiary of the Company. The Company will have a 50% stake
in the new entity, which will be managed by Uni-Select. Annual revenues for the
new company are expected to be C$120 million. For the year 2002, this
combination is expected to reduce sales for AGI by approximately US$30-35
million, but should have no material effect on net earnings.

No gain or loss
will be recognized when this transaction is finalized. As of December 31, 2001,
and until February 1, 2002, the results of the Company’s automotive
aftermarket division are consolidated with AGI. Beginning February 2, 2002, the
Company will account for its interest using the equity method.

On February 28, 2002, the
Company purchased substantially all of the assets, consisting of 4,801,600
shares of Company common stock and cash, of Mountain Capital Corporation, a
Nevada corporation (“MCC”). In exchange, the Company transferred to
MCC 4,695,725 shares of Company common stock. The number of shares transferred
reflects a 1.5% discount from the number of shares received, and additionally
reflects other adjustments designed to reimburse the Company for its transaction
expenses and for the Company’s payment of certain indebtedness of MCC. The
shares received by MCC from the Company were subsequently distributed to the MCC
shareholders pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation of MCC.

The transaction documentation includes:

(i)

a Purchase Agreement containing the terms and conditions of the transaction,

(ii)

an Escrow Agreement providing for the pledge by MCC of 10% of the shares
received in the transaction, and the pledge by the MCC shareholders of the
escrowed shares, as security for the indemnification obligations and liabilities
of MCC and the MCC shareholders, and

(iii)

a Share Transfer Restriction
Agreement providing for certain restrictions on the transfer of Company common
stock received by or otherwise held by the MCC shareholders and certain other
parties to that agreement.

Prior to the transaction,
James D. Slavik, a Company director, was the president and a director of MCC. In
addition, Mr. Slavik and certain members of his family owned all of the
outstanding stock of MCC either directly or indirectly, including through family
trusts of which Mr. Slavik served as trustee. Mr. Slavik was not present and did
not participate in any of the deliberations of the Board of Directors or its
Board Affairs and Nominating Committee relating to the review, consideration or
approval of the transaction.
