PART I

Item 1: Business

The Company

W.W.
          Grainger, Inc., incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, is in the service
          business. It distributes products used by businesses and institutions across
          North America to keep their facilities and equipment running. In this report,
          the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc.
          and its subsidiaries.

Grainger uses a multichannel business
model to serve approximately 1.6 million customers of all sizes with multiple ways to find
and purchase facilities maintenance and other products through a network of branches,
field sales representatives, call centers, direct marketing media and the Internet. Orders
can be placed via telephone, fax, Internet or in person. Products are available for
immediate pick-up or for shipment.

Operating results are reported in
three segments: Branch-based Distribution, Lab Safety and Integrated Supply. The
Branch-based Distribution businesses primarily serve the needs of North American
businesses for facility maintenance products. Lab Safety Supply, Inc. (Lab Safety), a
direct marketing company, serves customers who purchase safety, industrial and other
products. Integrated Supply serves customers seeking to outsource some or all of their
indirect materials management processes.

Grainger has internal business
support functions which provide coordination and guidance in the areas of accounting,
administrative services, business development, communications, compensation and benefits,
employee development, enterprise systems, finance, human resources, insurance and risk
management, internal audit, investor relations, legal, real estate and construction
services, security and safety, taxes and treasury services. These services are provided in
varying degrees to all business units.

Grainger does not engage in basic or
substantive product research and development activities. Items are regularly added to and
deleted from Grainger’s product lines on the basis of market research,
recommendations of customers and suppliers, sales volumes and other factors.

Branch-based Distribution

The Branch-based Distribution
businesses provide North American customers with product solutions for facility
maintenance and other product needs through logistics networks, which are configured for
rapid product availability. Grainger offers a broad selection of facility maintenance and
other products through local branches, catalogs and the Internet. The Branch-based
Distribution businesses consist of the following Grainger divisions: Industrial Supply,
Acklands – Grainger Inc. (Canada), FindMRO, Export, Global Sourcing, Parts, Grainger,
S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), Grainger Caribe Inc. (Puerto Rico) and China Distribution. The more
significant of these businesses are described below.

Industrial Supply

Industrial Supply offers U.S.
businesses and institutions a combination of product breadth, local availability, speed of
delivery, detailed product information, simplicity of ordering and competitively priced
products. Industrial Supply distributes material handling equipment, safety and security
supplies, lighting and electrical products, tools and test instruments, pumps and plumbing
supplies, cleaning and painting supplies and many other items. Its customers range from
small and medium-sized businesses to large corporations and governmental and other
institutions. During 2004, Industrial Supply completed an average of 89,000 sales
transactions daily.

Industrial Supply operates 408
branches located in all 50 states. These branches are generally located within 20 minutes
of the majority of U.S. businesses and serve the immediate needs of their local markets by
allowing customers to pick up items directly from the branches.

Branches range in size from small,
will-call branches to large master branches. The Grainger Express® will-call branches
average 1,800 square feet, do not stock inventory and provide convenient pick-up
locations. Branches primarily fulfill counter and will-call needs and provide customer
service. Master branches handle a higher volume of counter and will-call customers daily,
in addition to shipping to customers for other branches in their area. On average, a
branch is 20,000 square feet in size, has 11 employees and handles about 136 transactions
per day. In 2004, Industrial Supply opened 19 new branches, relocated 15 branches and
expanded or remodeled 17 branches. Five branches were closed in 2004.

In March 2004, Industrial Supply
completed the project of reconfiguring its distribution network. The new network is
comprised of nine distribution centers (DCs) – five new and four redesigned
facilities – which handle most of the customer shipping and also replenish branch
inventories. The new facilities average more than 300,000 square feet in size. The DCs,
using automated equipment and processes, ship orders, including Internet orders, directly
to customers for all branches located in their service areas. The DC located in Chicago is
also a national distribution center providing customers and the entire network with slower
moving inventory items.


Industrial Supply sells principally
to customers in industrial and commercial maintenance departments, service shops,
manufacturers, hotels, government, retail organizations, transportation businesses,
contractors, and healthcare and educational facilities. Sales transactions during 2004
were made to approximately 1.3 million customers. Approximately 24% of 2004 sales
consisted of private label items bearing the Company’s registered trademarks,
including DAYTON® (principally electric motors, heating and ventilation equipment),
TEEL® (liquid pumps), SPEEDAIRE® (air compressors), AIR HANDLER® (air
filtration equipment), DEM-KOTE® (spray paints), WESTWARD® (principally hand and
power tools), CONDOR™ (safety products) and LUMAPRO® (task and outdoor lighting).
Grainger has taken steps to protect these trademarks against infringement and believes
that they will remain available for future use in its business. Sales of remaining items
generally consisted of products carrying the names of other well-recognized brands.

The current Industrial Supply
catalog, issued in February 2005, offers more than 82,000 facility maintenance and other
products. Approximately 1.4 million copies of the catalog were produced. A CD-ROM version
of the catalog supplements the paper version. Approximately 690,000 copies of the CD-ROM
catalog were produced.

Customers can also purchase products
through grainger.com. This Web site serves as a prominent service channel for the
Industrial Supply division. Customers have access to a much larger selection of products
through grainger.com than is contained in the catalog. It is available 24/7, providing
real-time product availability, customer-specific pricing, multiple product search
capabilities, customer personalization, and links to customer support and the fulfillment
system. For large customers interested in connecting to grainger.com through sophisticated
purchasing platforms, grainger.com has a universal connection. This technology translates
the different data formats used by electronic marketplaces, exchanges, and e-procurement
systems and allows these systems to communicate directly with Industrial Supply’s
operating platform. Orders processed through grainger.com resulted in sales of $611.3
million in 2004, $478.6 million in 2003 and $419.5 million in 2002.

Industrial Supply purchases products
for sale from approximately 1,100 suppliers, most of which are manufacturers. No single
supplier comprised more than 10% of Industrial Supply’s purchases and no significant
difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply.

Acklands – Grainger
Inc. (Acklands)

Acklands is Canada’s leading
broad-line distributor of industrial, automotive fleet and safety supplies. It serves
customers through 166 branches and five distribution centers across Canada. Acklands
distributes tools, lighting products, safety supplies, pneumatics, instruments, welding
equipment and supplies, motors, shop equipment and many other items. During 2004,
approximately 14,000 sales transactions were completed daily. A comprehensive catalog,
printed in both English and French, showcases the product line to facilitate customer
selection. This catalog, with more than 43,000 products, supports the efforts of field
sales representatives throughout Canada. In addition, customers can purchase products
through www.acklandsgrainger.com.

FindMRO

FindMRO is a sourcing service.
Through sophisticated search technologies and sourcing expertise, FindMRO locates
facilities maintenance and other products when a source is unknown to the customer.
FindMRO has access to more than 4,000 suppliers and five million products. Orders can be
placed with a Grainger sales representative or a branch employee.

Global Sourcing

Global Sourcing procures
competitively priced, high-quality products produced outside the United States. Grainger
businesses sell these items primarily under private labels. Products obtained through
Global Sourcing include WESTWARD® tools, LUMAPRO® lighting products and
CONDOR™ safety products, as well as products bearing other trademarks.

Parts

Parts provides customers access to
more than 2.5 million parts and accessories, stocking nearly 76,000 of them in its
Northbrook, Illinois, warehouse. Customers can purchase parts over the telephone, at
grainger.com, or through a Grainger sales representative or branch employee. Trained
customer service representatives have online access to more than 300,000 pages of detailed
parts diagrams. Parts handled approximately 1.5 million customer calls in 2004 through its
call center in Waterloo, Iowa.

Mexico

Grainger’s operations in Mexico
provide local businesses with facility maintenance and other products from both Mexico and
the United States. From its six locations in Mexico and U.S. branches along the border,
the business provides delivery of approximately 43,000 products throughout Mexico. One new
branch was opened in 2004. The largest facility, an 85,000 square foot DC, is located
outside of Monterrey, Mexico. Customers can order products using a Spanish-language
general catalog or purchase them through www.grainger.com.mx.


Lab Safety

Lab Safety is a direct marketer of
safety and other industrial products to U.S. and Canadian businesses. Headquartered in
Janesville, Wisconsin, Lab Safety primarily reaches its customers through the distribution
of multiple branded catalogs, including a CD-ROM version, and other marketing materials
distributed throughout the year to targeted markets. Customers can purchase products
through www.lss.com, www.benmeadows.com and www.gemplers.com.

Lab Safety offers extensive product
depth, technical support and high service levels. During 2004, Lab Safety issued 11 unique
catalogs covering safety supplies, material handling and facility maintenance products,
lab supplies, security and other products targeted to specific customer groups. Lab Safety
provides access to more than 130,000 products through its targeted catalogs.

Integrated Supply

Integrated Supply serves customers
who have chosen to outsource some or all of their indirect materials management processes.
This service enables customers to focus on their core business objectives. Integrated
Supply offers a full complement of on-site outsourcing solutions, including business
process reengineering, inventory and tool crib management, purchasing management and
information management.

In 2005, Integrated Supply will no
longer offer on-site integrated purchasing and tool crib management services. It will be
merged into the Industrial Supply division and be reported in the Branch-based
Distribution segment. Industrial Supply plans to fulfill, but not renew, existing
Integrated Supply contracts.

Industry Segments

For 2004, Grainger is reporting three
industry segments: Branch-based Distribution, Lab Safety and Integrated Supply. Beginning
January 1, 2005, Integrated Supply will no longer be reported as a separate segment. For
segment and geographical information and consolidated net sales and operating earnings see
“

Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

” and “

Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

.”

Competition

Grainger faces competition in all
markets it serves, from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell
directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses and
certain retail enterprises.

Grainger provides local product availability, sales
representatives, competitive pricing, catalogs (which include product descriptions and, in
certain cases, extensive technical and application data), electronic and Internet commerce
technology and other services to assist customers in lowering their total facility
maintenance costs. Grainger believes that it can effectively compete with manufacturers on
small orders, but manufacturers may have an advantage in filling large orders.

Grainger serves a number of diverse
markets. Based on available data, Grainger estimates the United States market for
facilities maintenance products to be approximately $100 billion, of which Grainger’s
share is between 4 and 5 percent. There are a small number of large competitors, although
most of the market is served by small, local and regional competitors.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, Grainger had
15,523 employees, of whom 13,260 were full-time and 2,263 were part-time or temporary.
Grainger has never had a major work stoppage and considers employee relations to be good.

Web Site Access to
Company Reports

Grainger makes available, free of
charge, through its Web site, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably
practicable after this material is electronically filed with or furnished to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. This material may be accessed by visiting
www.grainger.com/investor.


Item 2: Properties

As of December 31, 2004,
Grainger’s owned and leased facilities totaled 17,936,000 square feet, essentially
the same as 2003. Decreases due to the sale of the former
New Jersey facility and to the consolidation of Canadian facilities were offset by increases
related to the market expansion program. Industrial Supply and Acklands accounted for the
majority of the total square footage. Industrial Supply facilities are located throughout
the United States. Acklands facilities are located throughout Canada.

Industrial Supply branches range in
size from 1,200 to 109,000 square feet and average approximately 20,000 square feet. Most
are located in or near major metropolitan areas with many located in industrial parks.
Typically, a branch is on one floor, is of masonry construction, consists primarily of
warehouse space, sales areas and offices and has off-the-street parking for customers and
employees. Grainger considers that its properties are generally in good condition and well
maintained.

(2)

Industrial Supply branches consist of 283 owned and 125 leased properties. The
          owned facilities are not subject to any mortgages.

(3)

Other facilities primarily include locations for Lab Safety, other business
          units and properties under construction. Two facilities are located in Puerto
          Rico and six are located in Mexico, all of which are leased. The owned
          facilities are not subject to any mortgages.

(4)

Acklands facilities consist of general offices, distribution centers and
          branches, of which 58 are owned and 108 leased. The owned facilities are not
          subject to any mortgages.

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

Grainger has been named, along with
numerous other nonaffiliated companies, as a defendant in litigation in various states
involving asbestos and/or silica. These lawsuits typically assert claims of personal
injury arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and/or silica as a consequence of
products purportedly distributed by Grainger. As of January 28, 2005, Grainger is named in
cases filed on behalf of approximately 3,700 plaintiffs in which there is an allegation of
exposure to asbestos and/or silica. In addition, during 2004, five cases previously filed
against Grainger alleging exposure to cotton dust were amended to include allegations
relating to asbestos; these cases involve approximately 2,100 plaintiffs.

Grainger has denied, or intends to
deny, the allegations in all of the above-described lawsuits. In 2004, lawsuits relating
to asbestos and/or silica and involving approximately 700 plaintiffs were dismissed with
respect to Grainger, typically based on the lack of product identification. If a specific
product distributed by Grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits, Grainger would
attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer. In
addition, Grainger believes that a substantial portion of these claims are covered by
insurance. Grainger is engaged in active discussions with its insurance carriers regarding
the scope and amount of coverage. While Grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these
lawsuits, it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Grainger’s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

On September 28, 2004, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) filed an administrative complaint against Grainger
seeking a civil penalty of $0.4 million for alleged violations of federal clean-air law
and regulations. The complaint alleges that Grainger sold a “non-essential”
wheel chock product which contained and/or was manufactured with an ozone-depleting
substance (ODS). The complaint also alleges that Grainger sold aerosol cleaning fluids
containing an ODS without displaying proper notification where the products were sold.
According to the complaint, Grainger sold the cleaning fluids to persons who did not
provide proof that they were commercial purchasers and failed to verify that such persons
were commercial purchasers. Grainger does not believe that the resolution of this matter
will have a material adverse effect on Grainger’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.


In addition to the foregoing, from
time to time Grainger is involved in various other legal and administrative proceedings
that are incidental to its business. These include claims relating to product liability,
general negligence, environmental issues, employment, intellectual property and other
matters. As a government contractor, from time to time Grainger is also subject to
governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits. It is not expected that the ultimate
resolution of any of these matters will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on Grainger’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Item 4: Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote
of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2004.

The results for 2004 included an
effective tax rate, excluding the effect of equity in unconsolidated entities, of 35.6%,
which was down from 40.0% in the prior year. The lower tax rate resulted in an increase to
earnings of $19.4 million or $0.21 per diluted share. The tax rate reduction was primarily
due to a lower tax rate in Canada, the realization of tax benefits related to operations
in Mexico and to capital losses, the recognition of tax benefits from the “Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (the Medicare Act) and
the resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies.

The results for 2002 included an
after-tax gain on the sale of securities of $4.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and
an after-tax gain on the reduction of restructuring reserves established for the shutdown
of the Material Logic business of $1.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. These were
offset by the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for the write-down of goodwill
of $23.9 million after-tax, or $0.26 per diluted share, related to Grainger’s
Canadian subsidiary.

The results for 2001 included an
after-tax charge of $36.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, related to the
restructuring charge established in connection with the closing of the Material Logic
business and the write-down of investments in other digital enterprises.

The results for 2000 included an
after-tax gain of $17.9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, related to sales of
investment securities.

Item 7:    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

General.

Grainger is the leading broad-line supplier of facilities maintenance and other
          related products in North America. For each of the three years presented in this
          Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, Grainger
          reported its operating results in three segments: Branch-based Distribution, Lab
          Safety and Integrated Supply. Grainger distributes a wide range of products used
          by businesses and institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and
          running. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a
          range of options for finding and purchasing products through a network of
          branches, field sales forces, direct marketing including catalogs, and a variety
          of electronic and Internet channels. Grainger serves customers through a network
          of 582 branches, 17 distribution centers and multiple Web sites.

Beginning January 1, 2005,
Grainger’s Integrated Supply business will no longer offer on-site integrated
purchasing and tool crib management services and will be merged into Grainger’s
Industrial Supply division within the Branch-based Distribution segment. Grainger
Industrial Supply plans to fulfill, but not renew, existing Integrated Supply contracts.
As such, in 2005 Integrated Supply will no longer be reported as a separate segment and
Grainger will report its operating results in two segments: Branch-based Distribution and
Lab Safety.

Business
Environment.

Several economic factors and industry trends shape Grainger’s business
environment. The current overall economy and leading economic indicators forecast by
economists provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in
the development of projections for the upcoming year. At the start of 2005, the Consensus
Forecast-USA is predicting GDP and Industrial Production growth of 3 to 4 percent for
2005.

In 2004, Grainger benefited from the
economic recovery in the United States. Grainger’s sales correlate positively with
production growth. With the improvement in Industrial Production and general growth in the
economy, Grainger realized an increase in sales across all customer segments.
Grainger’s sales also tend to increase when non-farm payrolls grow, especially during
economic recoveries. Non-farm payrolls increased approximately 1%, on average, in 2004
over 2003. For 2004, Grainger benefited from the combination of increased Industrial
Production and non-farm payroll growth.

The light and heavy manufacturing
customer segments, which comprised over 25% of Grainger’s total 2004 sales, have
historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production.
Manufacturing employment levels increased less than 1% during 2004, while manufacturing
output increased approximately 4.8%. This contributed to the double-digit sales growth in
the light and heavy manufacturing customer segments for Grainger in 2004. Economic
forecasts suggest that the manufacturing sector will continue to expand in 2005.

In 2004, Grainger launched a
multiyear initiative to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better
position itself to serve the local customer. The success of the market expansion program
is expected to be a driver of growth in 2005 and beyond. Three phases of the market
expansion program were in progress at December 31, 2004, and are scheduled for completion
in 2005. Additional phases are scheduled for 2005 and beyond.

The customer’s buying behavior
is also important in Grainger’s business environment. Grainger believes that
customers will continue to focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities maintenance
products. Grainger is therefore increasing product information available to employees for
improved service to customers by installing an upgraded SAP operating system and
accelerating the replacement of its legacy information systems with a new integrated
software package also provided by SAP, starting with the U.S. branch-based businesses. Integration,
volume and user acceptance testing is currently scheduled for the third quarter of 2005.

Grainger’s financial strength,
including its low debt and strong cash flow, leaves it well positioned to fund major
initiatives, improve effectiveness and accelerate top line growth. Capital spending in
2004 related to the branch network and information technology was approximately $118
million, with total capital expenditures of nearly $161 million. Capital spending was
approximately $20 million higher than the most recent forecast due to the acceleration of
the replacement and upgrade of the branch communication systems and the ongoing SAP
initiatives.

In 2005, total capital expenditures
of $150 to $180 million are anticipated. Grainger intends to continue its investment in
the market expansion program and information technology enhancements with spending planned
for the following major projects:

•

$60 to $70 million for continued market expansion;

•

$35 to $40 million for information technology; and

•

$10 to $12 million for Canadian branch programs.

Capital spending for the market
expansion program may be affected by lease or purchase decisions, based on availability of
facilities.


Matters
Affecting Comparability.

Grainger’s operating results for 2004 included a full year
of operating results of Gempler’s. Grainger’s operating results for 2003
included the results of Gempler’s only from the acquisition date of April 14, 2003.
Gempler’s results are included in the Lab Safety segment.

Grainger has made reclassifications
to the prior years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, to reduce cost of merchandise sold
and increase operating (advertising) expenses for vendor provided funding in order to
maintain comparable reporting with the year ended December 31, 2004. See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

2004 Compared to 2003

Grainger’s net sales for 2004 of $5,049.8
million were up 8.2% versus 2003. The increase in net sales was a result of the
strengthening in the manufacturing and commercial sectors. Full year results also
benefited from the completion of the logistics network upgrade, which improved product
availability, as well as from the launch of the market expansion project, an expanded
sales force and new communication technology in the U.S. branches. The increase in net
sales was realized in the Branch-based Distribution and Lab Safety segments of the
business, while net sales in the Integrated Supply segment were essentially flat year over
year.

The gross profit margin of 37.8% in
2004 improved 1.6 percentage points over the gross profit margin of 36.2% in 2003,
principally due to product cost reduction programs, including the global sourcing of
products, combined with selected price increases in 2004 and the positive effect of
product mix. These margin improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in
selling price category mix.

Grainger’s operating earnings of
$439.5 million in 2004 increased $52.3 million, or 13.5%, over the prior year. The
operating margin of 8.7% in 2004 improved 0.4 percentage point over 2003, as the combined
effect of increased sales and improvement in gross profit margin exceeded the increase in
operating expenses. Operating expenses were up 12.5% in 2004 principally due to higher
variable compensation and benefits associated with the improved performance for the year,
as well as to incremental costs related to the market expansion and information technology
programs.

In 2004, net earnings of $286.9
million increased $60.0 million, or 26.4%, over the prior year. The growth in net earnings
was due to the improvement in operating earnings, higher interest income and a lower tax
rate. Diluted earnings per share for 2004 of $3.13 were 27.2% higher than the $2.46 for
2003.


Segment Analysis

The following comments at the segment
level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the
business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating
earnings. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution

Net sales of $4,520.0 million in 2004
increased 8.5% over 2003 net sales of $4,167.2 million. Sales in the United States were up
8.2% over the prior year. All customer segments increased, with the strongest sales growth
in the manufacturing and commercial sectors. National account sales, which include all
customer segments, were up 12%. Sales to government accounts were up 5% primarily due to
increased sales to the U.S. Postal Service and to federal, state and local governments.
Sales processed through the grainger.com Web site were $611.3 million for 2004, an
increase of 27.7% over 2003.

Net sales in Canada were 11.1% higher
in 2004 than in 2003, benefiting primarily from a favorable Canadian exchange rate. In
local currency, sales increased 3.3%, primarily due to a strengthening in the Canadian
economy in the second half of the year driven by the natural resources sector. Sales in
Mexico were up 15.4% in 2004 as compared to 2003, driven by an improving local economy,
expanded telesales operations and several branch facility enhancements during the year.

Cost of merchandise sold of $2,778.2
million increased $148.6 million, or 5.6%, over 2003 due to increased volume, while gross
profit margins improved 1.6 percentage points to 38.5% in 2004 from 36.9% in 2003.
Contributing to the improvement in gross profit margin were product cost reduction
programs, which included the global sourcing of additional products, combined with
selected price increases and the positive effect of product mix. These margin improvements
were partially offset by unfavorable changes in selling price category mix.

Operating expenses for the
Branch-based Distribution businesses increased 11.6% in 2004. Operating expenses were up
primarily as a result of higher sales commissions and bonus and profit sharing accruals
associated with the improved 2004 performance, as well as increased costs related to
strategic initiatives such as the market expansion program and technology upgrades.
Partially offsetting these increases was improved productivity achieved from the
redesigned logistics network.

In 2004, operating earnings of $461.4
million increased by $71.2 million, or 18.2%, over 2003. The effect of sales growth,
combined with the improvement in gross profit margin, more than offset the increase in
operating expenses.

Lab Safety

Net sales at Lab Safety were $336.7
million in 2004, an increase of $31.2 million, or 10.2%, when compared with $305.5 million
of sales in 2003. Higher sales were principally driven by growth in nonsafety products.
Sales through Lab Safety’s Web sites were up 26.1% in 2004 over 2003. Also
contributing to the year-over-year increase were incremental sales from Gempler’s,
which was acquired on April 14, 2003. Excluding Gempler’s, sales increased 6.1% over
2003.

The gross profit margin of 41.8%
decreased 0.4 percentage point when compared to the gross profit margin of 42.2% for 2003.
Contributing to the decline was the negative effect of selling price category mix combined
with the effect of a full year of Gempler’s sales which carry a lower gross profit
margin.

Operating expenses were $95.3 million
in 2004, up $8.4 million, or 9.6%, over 2003. The increase over the prior year was
principally driven by higher variable compensation expense related to the strong
performance for the year, higher catalog media costs and higher benefits expenses from
increases in healthcare costs. Also contributing to the increase were costs associated
with Gempler’s for a full year in 2004 versus a partial year in 2003.

Operating earnings of $45.5 million
were up 8.6% in 2004 over 2003, resulting primarily from the increase in sales, partially
offset by the lower gross profit margin and increased operating expenses.

Integrated Supply

Integrated Supply net sales of $211.1
million in 2004 were down $0.6 million, or essentially flat when compared with 2003.
Incremental sales at ten new customer locations were more than offset by the disengagement
of two large customers late in 2003, lower sales to two large customers and lower
management fees. Sales included both product sales, which are passed through to the
customer at cost, and management fees.

Gross profit declined $0.8 million in
2004 and the gross profit margin of 11.6% declined 0.3 percentage point from 11.9% in
2003. The primary driver of these declines was lower management fees. Operating expenses
decreased slightly in 2004, down 0.5%, principally due to a reduction in data processing
costs and related contract services.

Operating earnings of $2.5 million
for 2004 for Integrated Supply declined $0.7 million, or 23.1%, compared to $3.2 million
in 2003.


Other Income and Expense

Other income and expense was $5.6
million of income in 2004, an improvement of $11.8 million as compared with $6.2 million
of expense in 2003. The following table summarizes the components of other income and
expense:

The improvement in other income and
expense in 2004 over 2003 was primarily attributable to net interest income in 2004 versus
net interest expense in 2003, as well as a $3.3 million improvement in the results of
unconsolidated entities. The change to net interest income in 2004 from net interest
expense in 2003 was due to the combination of higher interest rates and invested balances,
together with the reduction in outstanding long-term debt balances. Additionally, 2003
included $1.9 million in expense for the write-off of investments in two Asian joint
ventures and $1.6 million in expense for the write-down of investment securities. See Note
9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

Income taxes of $158.2 million in
2004 increased 2.7% as compared with $154.1 million in 2003.

Grainger’s effective tax rates
were 35.5% and 40.4% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Excluding the effect of equity in
unconsolidated entities and the write-off of these investments, which are recorded net of
tax, the effective income tax rates were 35.6% for 2004 and 40.0% for 2003. The tax rate
reduction was primarily due to a lower tax rate in Canada, as well as the realization of
tax benefits related to operations in Mexico and to capital losses, the recognition of tax
benefits from the Medicare Act and the resolution of certain federal and state tax
contingencies.

For 2005, Grainger is projecting its
estimated effective tax rate to be 37.0%, excluding the effects of equity in
unconsolidated entities.

2003 Compared to 2002

Grainger’s net sales of $4,667.0
million for 2003 were essentially flat compared to 2002. Full-year results were affected
by the general weakness in the U.S. economy. Sales in the Branch-based Distribution
business segment increased $19.2 million over 2002, or 0.5%, generally unchanged year over
year. Revenue increased in the Lab Safety segment, while sales for Integrated Supply
declined.

Despite the limited sales growth
experienced during the year, gross profit margins improved in 2003 to 36.2% from 35.7%,
principally due to favorable changes in product mix and selected price increases designed
to offset increased freight and other costs. Grainger’s operating earnings of $387.3
million in 2003 decreased 1.5% from the prior year. Operating margins declined to 8.3% in
2003 from 8.5% in 2002 reflecting higher operating expenses year over year. The principal
driver of the operating expense increase was higher severance and healthcare expenses.

Grainger’s net earnings of
$227.0 million in 2003 increased $15.4 million, or 7.3%, as compared with 2002 net earnings
of $211.6 million. Diluted earnings per share for the year increased to $2.46 in 2003 from
$2.24 in 2002. In 2002, Grainger recorded a $23.9 million after-tax charge for the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The results for 2002 also included
an after-tax gain of $1.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, from the reduction of
restructuring reserves established for the shutdown of Material Logic.


Segment Analysis

The following comments at the segment
level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the
business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating
earnings. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution

Net sales at the Branch-based
Distribution businesses totaled $4,167.2 million in 2003 and were essentially flat when
compared with 2002 sales of $4,148.0 million. Sales in the United States declined
approximately 1% in 2003 as compared with 2002. Government account sales were up nearly
11% in 2003, while all other customer segments, including light and heavy manufacturing,
were down when compared with 2002. The declines noted in the other customer segments were
primarily due to the weakness in the U.S. economy, particularly in manufacturing. Within
these customer segments, sales to national accounts increased approximately 2% over 2002.

Sales growth through Internet
channels continued in 2003, 15.9% over 2002 and represented 12.6% of segment sales.

Sales in Canada increased 15.4% in
2003, principally due to a favorable exchange rate. In local currency, sales grew 2.7%,
primarily in Ontario and national accounts. In Mexico, sales declined 3.7% in 2003 as
compared with 2002, principally due to a weak economy in Mexico.

Cost of merchandise sold of $2,629.7
million for 2003 in the Branch-based Distribution businesses was essentially flat compared
to $2,638.6 million in 2002. Gross profit margins increased 0.5 percentage point to 36.9%
in 2003 from 36.4% in 2002. Selected price increases designed to offset increased freight
and other costs both in the United States and Canada, combined with a favorable change in
product mix, contributed to the margin increase.

Branch-based Distribution operating
expenses increased 2.9% in 2003, primarily due to higher severance and healthcare expenses
and increased occupancy costs.

Operating earnings of $390.2 million
in 2003 declined by $4.7 million, or 1.2%, as compared with 2002. The increase in operating
expenses year over year more than offset the improvement in gross profit margin.

Lab Safety

Net sales at Lab Safety increased by
$18.7 million to $305.5 million in 2003, a 6.5% increase over 2002. The sales growth was
attributable to incremental sales from Gempler’s, acquired on April 14, 2003.
Excluding the results of Gempler’s, year-over-year net sales decreased 2.0% as a
result of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy. A major portion of Lab
Safety’s sales are to manufacturers. The overall decline in the manufacturing sector
was partially offset by increased sales to customers in the forestry and public safety
markets.

The gross profit margin of 42.2%
decreased 0.7 percentage point due to incremental sales of Gempler’s products, which
have lower gross margins than the rest of Lab Safety’s products. In addition, in 2003
there was a shift in sales mix to lower margin new product sales.

Lab Safety operating expenses of
$87.0 million increased 14.6% in 2003, when compared with $75.9 million for 2002. The
primary driver of the year-over-year increase was the incremental costs associated with
the addition of Gempler’s during the year and higher spending on catalog media.

As a result, operating earnings of
$41.9 million for Lab Safety in 2003 declined 11.1% from operating earnings of $47.1
million in 2002.

Integrated Supply

Integrated Supply net sales of $211.7
million in 2003 were $14.3 million lower than $226.0 million of net sales in 2002. The
6.3% decrease in net sales resulted from six site disengagements, as well as lower volumes
from existing customers. The decrease in sales was partially offset by incremental sales
at seven new customer sites. Sales included both product sales, which are passed through
to the customer at cost, and management fees.

Gross profit declined $1.9 million in
2003 due to lower management fees. Operating expenses of $22.1 million increased 5.4% in
2003, when compared with $21.0 million for 2002. The increase of $1.1 million was
principally due to a higher provision for bad debts, combined with incremental costs
associated with a systems upgrade.

Operating earnings of $3.2 million in
2003 for Integrated Supply declined $3.0 million from operating earnings of $6.2 million
in 2002.


Other Income and Expense

Other income and expense was $6.2
million of expense in 2003, an unfavorable change of $10.9 million as compared with $4.7
million of income in 2002. The following table summarizes the components of other income
and expense:

In the fourth quarter of 2003,
Grainger wrote off its investment in two Asian joint ventures resulting in an after-tax
charge to earnings of $1.9 million. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The reduction in gains on sales of fixed assets resulted from the sale of one facility in
2003 versus two in 2002.

Income Taxes

Income taxes of $154.1 million in
2003 declined 5.1% as compared with $162.3 million in 2002.

Grainger’s effective tax rates
were 40.4% and 40.8% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Excluding the effect of the equity
losses in unconsolidated entities and the write-off of these investments, which did not
result in tax benefits, the effective income tax rates were 40.0% for 2003 and 40.5% for
2002. This change in effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower nondeductible losses
in Mexico and a lower tax rate in Canada.

Cumulative Effect of
Accounting Change

Effective January 1, 2002, Grainger adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.”

In the second quarter of 2002,
Grainger completed the initial process of evaluating goodwill for impairment under SFAS
No. 142. Fair values of reporting units were estimated using a present value method that
discounted future cash flows. When available and as appropriate, comparative market
multiples were used to corroborate results of the discounted cash flows. As a result of
the application of the impairment methodology introduced by SFAS No. 142, Grainger
recorded a noncash charge to earnings of $32.3 million ($23.9 million after-tax, or $0.26
per diluted share) related to the write-down of goodwill of its Canadian subsidiary,
Acklands. Previous accounting rules required a comparison of book value to undiscounted
cash flows, whereas the new rules require a comparison of book value to discounted cash
flows, which are lower. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Financial Condition

Grainger expects its strong working
capital position and cash flows from operations to continue, allowing it to fund its
operations including growth initiatives and capital expenditures, as well as the payment
of long-term debt, the repurchases of shares and the payment of cash dividends at or above
historical levels.

Cash Flow

Net cash flows from operations of
$406.5 million in 2004, $394.1 million in 2003 and $303.5 million in 2002 continued to
improve Grainger’s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding. Net
cash provided by operations increased $12.4 million in 2004 over 2003 driven primarily by
increased net earnings. The Change in operating assets and liabilities – net of
business acquisition and joint venture contributions generated cash of $8.3 million in
2004. Trade accounts payable increased due to higher inventory purchases in the fourth
quarter of 2004. Increases in profit sharing and bonus accruals, driven by an improved
2004 performance, resulted in an increase in other current liabilities. These changes were
essentially offset by increases in inventory, as well as trade accounts receivable, which
were up due to higher December sales. The increase in net cash flows from operations from
2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to increased net earnings and an improvement in
working capital management. A reduction in inventory, resulting from efficiencies realized
from the redesigned logistics network, was partially offset by a decrease in trade
accounts payable from lower inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of 2003.

Net cash flows used in investing
activities were $142.4 million, $105.3 million and $105.8 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Capital expenditures for property, buildings, equipment and capitalized
software were $160.8 million, $80.5 million and $144.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the

Capital
Expenditures

section below. In 2003, Grainger also funded $36.7 million to purchase
Gempler’s, which is part of the Lab Safety segment. The results of operations for
Gempler’s have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the
acquisition date of April 14, 2003.

Net cash flows used in financing
activities for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $240.6 million, $97.9 million and $158.1 million,
respectively. During 2004, Grainger liquidated its cross-currency swap and related
commercial paper debt with payments totaling $140.8 million. Grainger’s funding of
treasury stock purchases increased $59.7 million in 2004, as Grainger repurchased
2,001,000 shares in 2004, compared with 918,300 shares in 2003. Treasury stock purchases
were 2,221,500 in 2002. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 7.1 million shares of
common stock remained available under Grainger’s repurchase authorization. Dividends
paid to shareholders were $71.2 million in 2004, $67.3 million in 2003 and $66.5 million
in 2002. Partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds from stock options
exercised of $72.3 million, $15.2 million and $17.1 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Working Capital

Internally generated funds have been
the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion,
supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated. In addition, funds were expended for
facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives, as well as for
business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements.

Working capital was $1,092.3 million
at December 31, 2004, compared with $926.8 million at December 31, 2003, and $898.7
million at December 31, 2002. At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities was 2.6, 2.3 and 2.5, respectively. The current ratio increased in 2004
principally due to Grainger’s liquidation of the cross-currency swap and related
commercial paper debt that had been classified in current liabilities in 2003.

Capital Expenditures

In each of the past three years, a
portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings,
equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table:

In 2004, Grainger’s investments
included the market expansion program, which is designed to re-align branches in several
metropolitan markets, ongoing SAP initiatives, an upgrade of the branch
communication systems and expenditures related to Canadian branch and systems projects.
Capital expenditures in 2003 related to Grainger’s investment in its logistics
network, which was completed in March 2004, spending for information technology upgrades,
as well as the normal, recurring replacement of equipment. Capital spending in 2002
reflects incremental spending for the logistics network project that began in 2000.


Capital expenditures are expected to
range between $150 to $180 million in 2005 and include investments for the ongoing market
expansion program, information technology and Canadian branch programs, as well as other
general projects including the normal, recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger
believes that cash flows from operations will remain strong and expects to fund the 2005
capital investments from existing working capital.

Debt

Grainger maintains a debt ratio and
liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and
long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has
various sources of financing available, including commercial paper sales and bank
borrowings under lines of credit. At December 31, 2004, Grainger’s long-term debt
rating by Standard & Poor’s was AA+. Grainger’s available lines of credit,
as further discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were $250.0
million, $265.4 million and $264.7 million, as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 0.5%, 7.5% and 7.2% as
of the same dates.

In September 2002, Grainger received
net proceeds of $113.7 million from the issuance of commercial paper. The proceeds were
used to repay outstanding long-term debt in the amount of C$180.4 million. The long-term
debt that was repaid with the proceeds of the commercial paper issuance had been
designated by Grainger as a nonderivative hedge of Grainger’s net investment in its
Canadian subsidiary. Grainger entered into a two-year cross-currency swap on September 25,
2002, which replaced the Canadian dollar long-term debt as a hedge of the net investment
in Grainger’s Canadian subsidiary. The counterparty to the financial instrument was
an investment grade financial institution. Grainger did not incur any loss from
nonperformance by this counterparty. Since Grainger had the ability to refinance the
commercial paper with debt having a longer maturity, and its intent was to keep the debt
outstanding for the two-year period of the cross-currency swap, the commercial paper was
originally classified as long-term debt. At December 31, 2003, Grainger had not determined
if it would renew the cross-currency swap when it came due in 2004 and as a result the
commercial paper debt was classified as Current maturities of long-term debt. On September
27, 2004, the cross-currency swap and related commercial paper debt matured and were
liquidated with payments totaling $140.8 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Grainger believes any circumstances
that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt
securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial
condition. Holders of industrial revenue bonds have various rights to require Grainger to
redeem these bonds, thus they are classified as Current maturities of long-term debt.

generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation
fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract.


The Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations table does not include
$74.7 million of accrued employment-related benefits costs, of which $45.8 million is
related to Grainger’s postretirement benefits. These amounts are excluded because a
portion of the projected benefit payments has already been funded by Grainger and the
timing of future funding requirements is not known. See Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

See also Notes 14 and 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

Grainger does not have any material
exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest
entities or activities that include nonexchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair
value.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial
statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions,
which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these
estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger’s results of operations for the
period in which the actual amounts become known.

Accounting policies are considered
critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly
uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those
management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of
Grainger’s financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of
operations.

Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management
judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from
management’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Postretirement Healthcare Benefits.

Postretirement obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates
used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount
rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. Changes in
assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could
have a material effect on Grainger’s postretirement benefit obligations and expense,
and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in
assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the
trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation.

The discount rate assumptions used by
management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of
December 31, the measurement date, of each year in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.” A
lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic
postretirement benefit costs. As of December 31, 2004, Grainger reduced the discount rate
used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 6.00% to 5.75% to
reflect the decline in interest rates. Grainger estimates that the reduction in the
expected discount rate will decrease 2005 pretax earnings by approximately $0.6 million.

Grainger considers the long-term
historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index to develop its expected long-term return on plan assets. In
2004, Grainger maintained the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0%
(net of tax at 40%) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return.

Grainger may terminate or modify the
postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the
event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure
to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption
that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate,
different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable.

While Grainger has used its best
judgment in making assumptions and estimates, and believes such assumptions and estimates
used are appropriate, changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a
result of actual experience and new trends and therefore, may affect Grainger’s
retirement plan obligations and future expense.

For additional information concerning
postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Insurance Reserves.

Grainger retains
a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers’ compensation,
general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and
self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does
not maintain insurance.

Grainger is responsible for
establishing policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to
project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss
development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its
insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve level.

The use of assumptions in the
analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required
reserve balance is reflected in the current period’s results of operations.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

Grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts
receivable including the age of the receivable and the historical ratio of actual
write-offs to the age of the receivable. The analyses performed also take into
consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of
customers or a specific customer.

Write-offs could be materially
different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results
deviate from historical trends.

Inventory Reserves.

Grainger
establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory. Provisions
for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage
or loss. Actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates
affecting Grainger’s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold.

Grainger regularly reviews inventory
to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory.
Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and
its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future
product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. Actual results differing from
these projections could have a material effect on Grainger’s results of operations.

Income Taxes.

Grainger accounts for
income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on
management’s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax
expense reflects Grainger’s best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other
items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning
opportunities. Future tax authorities’ rulings and future changes in tax laws and
their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax
planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded
by Grainger.

Other.

Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of
          measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important
          to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies relating to revenue
          recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets and warranties require
          judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources
          of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board and
          the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or
          assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material
          effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More
          information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to
          the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inflation and Changing
Prices

Inflation during the last three years
has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods
for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the
effects of inflation in the financial statements.

The major impact of inflation is on
buildings and improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost
continues for these long-lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with
these assets increases if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of
inflation.

Grainger believes the most positive
means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued
application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, increasing
working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate
prices in the marketplace.


Forward-Looking Statements

This document contains
forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. The forward-looking
statements relate to Grainger’s expected future financial results and business plans,
strategies and objectives and are not historical facts. They are often identified by
qualifiers such as “will,” “expects,” “intends,” “is
likely,” “anticipated,” “scheduled,” “believes,”
“positioned to,” “continue,” “estimates,”
“forecast,” “predicting,” “projection,”
“potential,” “assumption” or similar expressions. There are risks and
uncertainties the outcome of which could cause Grainger’s results to differ
materially from what is projected.

Factors that may affect
forward-looking statements include the following: higher product costs or other expenses;
a major loss of customers; increased competitive pricing pressure on Grainger’s
businesses; failure to develop or implement new technologies or other business strategies;
the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; changes in laws
and regulations; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; disruptions in transportation
services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and other
difficulties in achieving or improving margins or financial performance.

Trends and projections could also be
affected by general industry and market conditions, gross domestic product growth rates,
general economic conditions including interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, global
and other conflicts, employment levels and other factors.

Item 7A: Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Grainger is exposed to foreign
currency exchange risk related to its transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies. During a portion of 2004 and all of 2003, Grainger partially hedged
its net Canadian dollar investment in Acklands with a cross-currency swap agreement. This
agreement was terminated in 2004. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
For 2004, a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies
that affect Grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a $0.9 million decrease
in net income. Comparatively, in 2003 a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar
relative to foreign currencies that affect Grainger and its joint ventures would have
resulted in a $0.4 million decrease in net income. A uniform 10% weakening of the U.S.
dollar would have resulted in a $1.1 million increase in net income for 2004, as compared with
an increase in net income of $0.3 million for 2003. This sensitivity analysis of the
effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes
in sales levels or local currency prices. Grainger does not hold derivatives for trading
purposes.

Grainger is also exposed to interest
rate risk in its debt portfolio. During 2004 and 2003, all of its long-term debt was
variable rate debt. A one-percentage-point increase in interest rates paid by Grainger
would have resulted in a decrease to income of approximately $0.7 million for 2004 and
$0.9 million for 2003. A corresponding increase in net income for the noted periods would
have resulted had the interest rates paid decreased by one percentage point. This
sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on long-term debt does
not factor in potential changes in exchange rates or long-term debt levels.
Grainger’s level of interest rate risk has been reduced due to the liquidation of the
cross-currency swap and related commercial paper debt during 2004. See Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Grainger is not exposed to commodity
price risk since it purchases its goods for resale and does not purchase commodities
directly.

the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
Grainger’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.  Based upon that evaluation,

procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The
management of W.W. Grainger, Inc. (Grainger) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Grainger’s internal
control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Grainger’s management
and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements under all potential conditions. Therefore, effective internal control
over financial reporting provides only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance with
respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements.

Grainger’s
management assessed the effectiveness of Grainger’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

. Based on its assessment under that framework and the criteria
established therein, Grainger’s management concluded that Grainger’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

Grant
Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of Grainger’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, as stated in their report which is included
herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Directors

W.W. Grainger, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of W.W. Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive
earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the three years then ended. We
have also audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that W.W.
Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control
– Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). W.W. Grainger, Inc.’s management is responsible for these
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, an opinion on
management’s assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
and the receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorization of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of W.W. Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also in our opinion, management’s assessment that W.W. Grainger, Inc. and
Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Furthermore, in our opinion, W.W
Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

As discussed in Note 3, effective January 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

W.W. Grainger, Inc.
and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002

NOTE 1—BACKGROUND
AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

INDUSTRY INFORMATION

W.W.
          Grainger, Inc. is the leading broad-line supplier of facilities maintenance and
          other related products in North America. In this report, the words
          “Company” or “Grainger” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its
          subsidiaries.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

In preparing financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and
revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in the 2003 and 2002
financial statements, as previously reported, have been reclassified to conform to the
2004 presentation.

PRINCIPLES OF
CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
TRANSLATION

The financial statements of the
Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the
functional currency. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of
financial statements of foreign operations and related long-term debt are recorded as a
separate component of shareholders’ equity. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

INVESTMENTS IN
UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

For investments in which the Company
owns or controls from 20% to 50% of the voting shares, the equity method of accounting is
used. The Company also accounts for investments below 20% using the equity method when
significant influence can be exercised over the operating and financial policies of the
investee company. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 2—SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues recognized include product
sales, billings for freight and handling charges and fees earned for services provided.
The Company recognizes product sales and billings for freight and handling charges
primarily on the date products are shipped to, or picked up by, the customer. The
Company’s standard shipping terms are FOB shipping point. On occasion, the Company
will negotiate FOB destination terms. These sales are recognized upon delivery to the
customer. Fee revenues, which account for less than 1% of total revenues, are recognized
after services are completed.

VENDOR CONSIDERATION

The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
issued “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor” (Issue 02-16) in November 2002 with transition provisions
subsequently issued in January 2003. The January 2003 transition rules stated that Issue
02-16 would apply to all agreements entered into or significantly modified after December
31, 2002. The Company’s accounting treatment for vendor provided funds was consistent
with Issue 02-16, with the exception of vendor funded advertising allowances. The Company
had previously accounted for these allowances as an offset to operating (advertising)
expenses. Under Issue 02-16, this method is allowable if the allowances are for specific,
identifiable and incremental costs incurred by the Company in marketing its vendors’
products. The Company provides numerous advertising programs to promote its vendors’
products, including catalogs and other printed media, Internet and other marketing
programs. Most of these programs relate to multiple vendors, which makes supporting the
specific, identifiable and incremental criteria difficult, and would require numerous
assumptions and judgments. Based on the inexact nature of trying to track reimbursements
to the exact advertising expenditure for each vendor, the Company treats most vendor
advertising allowances as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold rather than a reduction
of operating (advertising) expenses. This change does not have any effect on net earnings.


For 2004, as new vendor contracts
became effective, most vendor allowances were classified in cost of merchandise sold
rather than in operating (advertising) expenses. The Company has made reclassifications to
the prior periods to maintain comparability. As a result, cost of merchandise sold was
reduced and operating (advertising) expenses were increased by $53.4 million and $61.1
million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

COST OF MERCHANDISE SOLD

Cost of merchandise sold includes
product and product related costs, vendor consideration, freight-out costs and handling
costs. The Company defines handling costs as those costs incurred to fulfill a shipped
sales order.

WAREHOUSING, MARKETING
AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Included in this category are
purchasing, branch operations, information services, and marketing and selling expenses,
as well as other types of general and administrative costs.

STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

The Company maintains various stock
incentive plans. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company
accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations. The Company recognizes compensation cost for
restricted shares and restricted stock units granted to employees. No compensation cost is
recognized for stock option grants. All options granted under the Company’s plans
have an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock on
the last trading day preceding the date of grant. The following table illustrates the
effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” to stock-based compensation. The following table also provides the
amount of stock-based compensation cost included in net earnings as reported:

ADVERTISING

Advertising costs are expensed in the
year the related advertisement is first presented. Advertising expense was $98.2 million,
$94.9 million and $87.4 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The majority of
vendor provided allowances are classified as an offset to cost of merchandise sold. Any
reimbursements from vendors that are classified as an offset against operating
(advertising) costs are recorded when the related advertising is expensed. For additional
information see subsection VENDOR CONSIDERATION.

For interim reporting purposes,
advertising expense is amortized equally over each period, based on estimated expenses for
the full year. Advertising costs for media that have not been presented by year-end are
capitalized as Prepaid expenses. Amounts included in Prepaid expenses at December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 were $18.2 million, $12.9 million and $13.7 million, respectively.

SOFTWARE COSTS

The Company does not sell, lease or
market software. The CD-ROM used by the Company’s customers is a version of the
catalog and is distributed at no charge. Costs associated with the CD-ROM are expensed in
the year incurred.


INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes
in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Income taxes are
recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the determination of financial
statement income, with deferred taxes being provided for temporary differences between
financial and tax reporting.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE
EARNINGS (LOSSES)

The Company’s Other
comprehensive earnings (losses) include foreign currency translation, with no related
income tax effects. Through the third quarter of 2004, the foreign currency translation
adjustments were partially offset by the after-tax effects of a designated hedge. Also included in
Other comprehensive earnings (losses) are unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net of
tax.

components of Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses):

CASH FLOWS

The Company considers investments in
highly liquid debt instruments, purchased with an original maturity of ninety days or
less, to be cash equivalents. For cash equivalents, the carrying amount approximates fair
value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL
ACCOUNTS

The Company establishes reserves for
customer accounts that are potentially uncollectible. The method used to estimate the
allowances is based on several factors including the age of the receivable and the
historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivable. These analyses also
take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific
industry, group of customers or a specific customer. Write-offs could be materially
different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results
deviate from historical trends.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower
of cost or market. Cost is determined primarily by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method,
which accounts for approximately 77% of total inventory. For the remaining inventory, cost
is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

PROPERTY, BUILDINGS AND
EQUIPMENT

Property, buildings and equipment are
valued at cost. For financial statement purposes, depreciation and amortization are
provided in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over
their estimated service lives, principally on the declining-balance and
sum-of-the-years-digits methods. The principal estimated useful lives for determining
depreciation are as follows:

Buildings, structures and
improvements                                                                                                                               
 
10 to 45 years

Furniture, fixtures, machinery and
equipment                                                                                                                          
3 to 10 years

Improvements to leased property are
amortized over the initial terms of the respective leases or the estimated service lives
of the improvements, whichever is shorter.

The Company capitalized interest
costs of $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

The carrying value of long-lived assets
is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of the asset may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted
future cash flows resulting from use of the asset, including disposition, is less than the
carrying value of the asset. Impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the fair value.


GOODWILL AND OTHER
INTANGIBLES

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” effective January 1, 2002. Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill is recognized as the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net amount
assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather
tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require.
Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than
its carrying value.

The Company recognizes an acquired
intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other
legal rights, or whenever it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and
sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination
with a related contract, asset or liability. Such intangibles are amortized over their
estimated useful lives unless the estimated useful life is determined to be indefinite.
Amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives of three to 17 years.
Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible, subject to
amortization, is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount
exceeds its fair value.

The Company also maintains intangible
assets with indefinite lives, which are not amortized. These intangibles are tested for
impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require, similar to the
treatment for goodwill. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value
of these assets is less than their carrying value.

INSURANCE RESERVES

The Company purchases insurance for
catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. It also retains a
significant portion of the risk of losses related to workers’ compensation, general
liability and property. Reserves for these potential losses are based on an external
analysis of the Company’s historical claims results and other actuarial assumptions.

WARRANTY RESERVES

The Company generally warrants the
products it sells against defects for one year. For a significant portion of warranty
claims, the manufacturer of the product is responsible for the expenses associated with
this warranty program. For warranty expenses not covered by the manufacturer, the Company
provides a reserve for future costs based primarily on historical experience. The reserve
activity was as follows:

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In January 2003, the FASB initially
issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities.” FIN 46 was revised in December 2003 when the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46 (revised December 2003) (FIN 46R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities.” FIN 46R is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
“Consolidated Financial Statements,” that replaces FIN 46 and revises the
requirements for consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities with
specific characteristics. The new consolidation requirements related to variable interest
entities are required to be adopted no later than the first reporting period that ends
after March 15, 2004 (as of March 31, 2004 for the Company). The Company adopted the
provisions of FIN 46R as of January 1, 2004, and adoption did not have an effect on its
results of operations or financial position.

In November 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs – an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.”
This statement amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter
4, “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) and requires that
those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the
criterion of “so abnormal.” The statement also requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. The provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005 (as of January 1, 2006 for the
Company) and are to be applied prospectively. The Company does not expect adoption of SFAS
No. 151 to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position.


In December 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R). This
statement requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions
be recognized in the financial statements. Compensation cost is to be measured based on
the estimated fair value of the equity-based compensation awards issued as of the grant
date. The related compensation expense will be based on the estimated number of awards
expected to vest and will be recognized over the requisite service period (often the
vesting period) for each grant. The statement requires the use of assumptions and
judgments about future events and some of the inputs to the valuation models will require
considerable judgment by management. SFAS No. 123R replaces FASB Statement No. 123 (SFAS
No. 123), “Accounting for Share-Based Compensation,” and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” The provisions of SFAS No.
123R are required to be applied by public companies as of the first interim or annual
reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005 (as of July 1, 2005 for the Company). The
Company intends to continue applying APB Opinion No. 25 to equity-based compensation
awards until the effective date of SFAS No. 123R. At the effective date of SFAS No. 123R,
the Company expects to use the modified prospective application transition method without
restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption. This will result in the
Company recognizing compensation cost based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all
equity-based compensation awards issued after July 1, 2005. For all equity-based
compensation awards that are unvested as of July 1, 2005, compensation cost will be
recognized for the unamortized portion of compensation cost not previously included in the
SFAS No. 123 pro forma footnote disclosure. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
that adoption of SFAS No. 123R may have on its results of operations or financial position
and expects that the adoption may have a material effect on the Company’s results of
operations depending on the level and form of future equity-based compensation awards
issued.

In December 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 152, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions – an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67.” This statement amends SFAS No. 66,
“Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” and SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for
Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,” in association with the
issuance of AICPA Statement of Position 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate
Time-Sharing Transactions.” The provisions of SFAS No. 152 are effective for
financial statements for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005 (as of January 1, 2006
for the Company). Restatement of previously issued financial statements is not permitted.
The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 152 to have a material effect on its
results of operations or financial position.

In December 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets – an amendment of APB Opinion No.
29.” The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of
nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.
Further, the amendments eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges that do not have
commercial substance. The provisions of this statement are effective for nonmonetary asset
exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 (July 1, 2005 for the
Company) and are to be applied prospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of
SFAS No. 153 to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position.

NOTE 3—CUMULATIVE
EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE

Effective January 1, 2002, the
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” and the
transition provisions of SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” As a result of
the application of the new impairment methodology introduced by SFAS No. 142, the Company
completed its initial process of evaluating goodwill for impairment and recorded a noncash
charge to earnings in 2002 of $32.3 million ($23.9 million after-tax, or $0.26 per diluted
share) related to the write-down of goodwill of its Canadian subsidiary, Acklands –
Grainger Inc. (Acklands). In performing the initial and periodic impairment reviews, the
fair value of the reporting units acquired were estimated using a present value method
that discounted future cash flows. When available and as appropriate, comparative market
multiples were used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flows. The Company
performs its annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for
impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and no further write-downs have been
required after the initial write-down noted above.

Previous accounting rules
incorporated a comparison of book value to undiscounted cash flows, whereas the new rules
require a comparison of book value to discounted cash flows, which are lower. There were
no material adjustments relating to the classification of the Company’s intangible
assets or amortization periods as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142.


NOTE 4—BUSINESS
ACQUISITIONS

On April 14, 2003, Lab Safety Supply,
Inc. (Lab Safety) acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities
of Gempler’s, a direct marketing division of Gempler’s, Inc., located in
Wisconsin. The results of Gempler’s operations have been included in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements since that date. Gempler’s, with
annual sales in 2002 of approximately $32 million, serves agricultural, horticultural,
grounds maintenance and contractor markets with tools, safety supplies, clothing and other
items.

The aggregate purchase price was
$36.7 million in cash and $0.7 million in assumed liabilities. Goodwill recognized in this
transaction was $22.8 million and is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. Due
to the immaterial nature of this transaction, disclosures of amounts assigned to the
acquired assets and liabilities and pro forma results of operations are not considered
necessary.

NOTE 5—SPECIAL
CHARGES

In 2001, the Company shutdown the
operations of Material Logic, with the exception of FindMRO, and wrote down its investment
in other digital activities. In connection with this shutdown, the Company took a pretax
charge against operating earnings of $39.1 million (after-tax $23.2 million) in 2001. The
Company provided a comprehensive separation package, including outplacement services, to
166 employees whose jobs were eliminated. Severance payments began in the second quarter
of 2001 and ended in the second quarter of 2004, when the last severance package expired.
Other shutdown costs included lease obligations, which were also settled in the second
quarter of 2004. The Company reduced the reserve by $0.2 million, $0.6 million and $1.9
million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to reflect management’s revised
estimate of costs.

The following tables show the

NOTE 6—CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company places temporary cash
investments with institutions of high credit quality and, by policy, limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one institution.

The Company has a broad customer base
representing many diverse industries doing business in all regions of the United States as
well as other areas of North America. Consequently, no significant concentration of credit
risk is considered to exist.

NOTE 8—INVENTORIES

Inventories primarily consist of
merchandise purchased for resale.

Inventories would have been $238.4
million, $234.4 million and $227.3 million higher than reported at December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively, if the FIFO method of inventory accounting had been used for all
Company inventories. Net earnings would have increased by $2.4 million, $4.3 million and
$1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, using the
FIFO method of accounting. Inventories using the FIFO method of accounting approximate
replacement cost.

NOTE 9—INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

On February 1, 2002, the Company
finalized an agreement creating the joint venture USI-AGI Prairies Inc. The joint venture
is between Acklands and Uni-Select Inc. (Uni-Select), a Canadian company. The joint
venture combined Uni-Select’s Western Division with the automotive aftermarket
division of Acklands, which operated as Bumper to Bumper. Acklands’ contribution of
net assets was approximately U.S.$14.6 million. Additionally, Acklands’ carrying
value of its investment in this joint venture includes U.S.$5.1 million of allocated
goodwill. The Company has a 50% stake in the new entity, which Uni-Select manages.

No gain or loss was recognized when
this transaction was finalized. Through February 1, 2002, the results of the
Company’s automotive aftermarket parts division were consolidated with Acklands.
Since February 2, 2002, the Company has accounted for its joint venture investment using
the equity method. In 2003, Acklands made a loan denominated in Canadian dollars to
USI-AGI Prairies Inc. of U.S.$3.7 million bearing interest at market rates. The loan is
due and payable on demand.

The Company also has held investments
in three Asian joint ventures. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company wrote-off its
investment in two of these Asian joint ventures due to the uncertainty regarding the
future profitability of these joint ventures and their ability to secure sufficient
capital funding. In the first quarter of 2004, the Company sold its 11% interest in one of
these investments for a gain of $0.8 million. At December 31, 2004, the ownership
percentages of the two remaining investments were 39% and 49%. The Company accounts
for these joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.

The table below summarizes the
activity of these investments:


NOTE 10—INVESTMENTS

Investments consist of marketable
securities and nonpublicly traded equity securities for which a market value is not
readily determinable. Marketable securities are all classified as available for sale and
are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses on such securities reflected,
net of taxes, in the Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) component of
shareholders’ equity. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” the Company evaluates whether a decline
in fair value below cost is other than temporary based on the amount of unrealized losses
and their duration. Other-than-temporary impairments are recognized in earnings.
Nonpublicly traded equity securities are reported at the lower of cost or estimated net
realizable value. Adjustments to net realizable value are recognized in earnings. There
have been no dividends earned on these investments. The Company completed the sale of its
investments in nonpublicly traded equity securities in 2004 and marketable securities in
2003. The gains on these sales were calculated using the specific identification method
and were reported in Unclassified – net.

The original cost, pretax realized
gains and unrealized (losses), reductions to net realizable value and fair value of
investments are as follows:

NOTE 11—CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

Amortization of capitalized software
is predominately on a straight-line basis over three and five years. Amortization begins
when the software is available for its intended use. Amortization expense was $10.7
million, $14.0 million and $17.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The Company reviews the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable. In 2004 and 2003, the Company determined certain capitalized amounts were
no longer recoverable and wrote-down the carrying value by $1.0 million in each year.

The Company and its subsidiaries had committed
lines of credit totalling $250.0 million, $265.4 million and $267.7 million at December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no
borrowings under the committed lines of credit. At December 31, 2002, borrowings under
Company committed lines of credit were $3.0 million. The committed lines of credit at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 included $15.4 million and $12.7 million, respectively,
denominated in Canadian dollars.

The Company also had $8.3 million,
$7.7 million and $15.9 million of uncommitted lines of credit denominated in Canadian
dollars at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company had $16.0 million, $15.0
million and $12.0 million of letters of credit at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, primarily related to the Company’s casualty insurance program. The
Company also had $0.9 million, $2.5 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively, in letters of credit to facilitate the purchase of product from
foreign sources.

NOTE 13—EMPLOYEE
BENEFITS

Retirement Plans.

A majority
of the Company’s employees are covered by a noncontributory profit sharing plan. This
plan provides for annual employer contributions generally based upon a formula related
primarily to earnings before federal income taxes, limited to 25% of the total
compensation paid to all eligible employees. The Company also sponsors additional defined
contribution plans, which cover most of the other employees. Provisions under all plans
were $74.2

million, $45.9 million and $50.0 million for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Postretirement Benefits.

The
Company has a postretirement healthcare benefits plan that provides coverage for a
majority of its retired employees and their dependents should they elect to maintain such
coverage. Covered employees become eligible for participation when they qualify for
retirement while working for the Company. Participation in the plan is voluntary and
requires participants to make contributions toward the cost of the plan, as determined by
the Company.

The “Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (the Medicare Act) was signed into law on
December 8, 2003. The Medicare Act provides a federal subsidy to retiree healthcare
benefit plan sponsors that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least
actuarially equivalent to that provided by Medicare. The Company adopted FASB Staff
Position No. 106-2 (FSP 106-2), “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” in the
third quarter ended September 30, 2004. FSP 106-2 provides guidance on the accounting for
the effects of the Medicare Act for employers that sponsor postretirement drug healthcare
plans that provide prescription drug benefits and requires those employers to provide
certain disclosures regarding the effect of the subsidy provided by the Medicare Act. The
prospective application method of FSP 106-2 was adopted by the Company and requires the
remeasurement of the accumulated projected benefit obligation (APBO) as of the beginning
of the period of adoption.

The Company compared its retiree
prescription drug coverage to the benefit provided under the Medicare Act and concluded
that the benefit provided under its plan is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit
provided under the Medicare Act. The Company’s APBO and its net periodic
postretirement benefit cost were remeasured as of July 1, 2004, based on the plan
provisions in place on the measurement date of January 1, 2004. The remeasurement reflects
the effect of the federal subsidy, which begins January 1, 2006. The remeasurement for the
subsidy reduced the APBO related to benefits attributed to past service by $20.8 million.
The effect of the subsidy reduced the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2004 by
$3.8 million, lowering service costs and interest costs on the APBO by $1.3 million each,
and the amortization of actuarial losses by $1.2 million.

The net periodic benefit costs
charged to operating expenses, which are valued with a measurement date of January 1 for
each year, including the effect of the 2004 remeasurement for the Medicare Act, consisted
of the following components:

The Company has elected to amortize
the amount of net unrecognized losses over a period equal to the average remaining service
period for active plan participants expected to retire and receive benefits, or
approximately 17.5 years.


Reconciliations of the beginning and
ending balances of the APBO, which is calculated using a December 31 measurement date, the
fair value of assets and the funded status of the benefit obligation follow:

The benefit obligation was determined
by applying the terms of the plan and actuarial models required by SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.”
These models include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed
rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The actuarial assumptions
also anticipate future cost-sharing changes to retiree contributions that will maintain
the current cost-sharing ratio between the Company and the retirees. The Company evaluates
its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and considers changes in these long-term
factors based upon market conditions, historical experience and the requirements of SFAS
No. 106.

The plan amendment effective January
1, 2004 changed the retiree co-payments, coinsurance amounts and out-of-pocket maximums
for participants. The plan amendment effective January 1, 2003 changed the prescription
drug benefits.

The following assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at
December 31:

year.


The Company reviews external data and
its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend
rates. Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for the healthcare plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed healthcare
cost trend rates would have the following effects on December 31, 2004 results:

The Company has established a Group
Benefit Trust to fund the plan and process benefit payments. The assets of the trust are
invested entirely in funds designed to track the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
(S&P 500). This investment strategy reflects the long-term nature of the plan
obligation and seeks to take advantage of the superior earnings potential of equity
securities. The Company uses the long-term historical return on the plan assets and the
historical performance of the S&P 500 to develop its expected return on plan assets.
The required use of an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in
recognizing income that is greater or less than the actual return on plan assets in any
given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate
the actual long-term returns and, therefore, result in a pattern of income recognition
that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees. The
change in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets did not have a material effect
on the net periodic benefit cost for either of the years ended December 31, 2004 or
December 31, 2003.

The funding of the trust is an
estimated amount which is intended to allow the maximum deductible contribution under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC), as amended, and was $6.2 million, $11.0 million and
$5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During
those years, $1.7 million, $2.0 million and $1.9 million were used directly for benefit
payments. There are no minimum funding requirements and the Company intends to follow its
practice of funding the maximum deductible contribution under the IRC.

The Company forecasts the following
benefit payments, which include a projection for expected future employee service: $2.1
million in 2005, $2.2 million in 2006, $2.5 million in 2007, $2.9 million in 2008, $3.4
million in 2009 and $26.6 million over the five-year period covering 2010 through 2014.

During the third quarter of 2002, the
Company refinanced a C$180.4 million bank loan that had been designated as a nonderivative
hedge of the net investment in the Company’s Canadian subsidiary. The bank loan was
replaced with commercial paper in support of a cross-currency swap (derivative
instrument). This derivative instrument was designated as a partial hedge of the net
investment in the Company’s Canadian subsidiary and was recognized on the balance
sheet at its fair value.

On September 27, 2004, the two-year
cross-currency swap and related commercial paper debt matured and were liquidated with
payments totalling U.S.$140.8 million. The cross-currency swap was based on notional
principal amounts of C$180.4 million and U.S.$113.7 million, respectively. Initially, the
Company gave the counterparty U.S.$113.7 million and received from the counterparty
C$180.4 million. The Company received interest based on the 30-day U.S. commercial paper
rate. At the maturity date of the cross-currency swap, this rate was 1.62%. The Company
paid interest to the counterparty based on the 30-day Canadian Bankers’ Acceptances
rate plus 14 to 19 basis points. At the maturity date of the cross-currency swap, this
rate was 2.32%. The outstanding underlying commercial paper was U.S.$114.2 million with an
interest rate of 1.58% at the maturity date of the cross-currency swap. The fair value of
the derivative instrument was a liability of U.S.$28.1 million at the maturity date.


The cross-currency swap was an
over-the-counter instrument with a liquid market. The Company established strict
counterparty credit guidelines and entered into the transaction with an investment grade
financial institution. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.

While the cross-currency swap was
outstanding, the Company formally assessed, on a quarterly basis, whether the
cross-currency swap was effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the
underlying exposure. Because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging
instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged, exchange rate changes in the value of
the cross-currency swap were generally offset by changes in the value of the net
investment. Under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” changes in the fair value of this instrument were recognized in foreign
currency translation adjustments, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive earnings
(losses), to offset the change in the value of the net investment of the Canadian
investment being hedged. During 2004, the Company included a U.S.$0.6 million net of tax
loss related to this hedge, which included the settlement of the cross-currency swap, in
Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses). The impact to 2004, 2003 and 2002
earnings resulting from the ineffective portion of the hedge was immaterial.

The industrial development revenue
and private activity bonds include various issues that bear interest at variable rates
capped at 15%, and come due in various amounts from 2009 through 2021. At December 31,
2004, the weighted average interest rate was 2.31%. Interest rates on some of the issues
are subject to change at certain dates in the future. The bondholders have the right to
require the Company to redeem certain bonds concurrent with a change in interest rates and
certain other bonds annually. In addition, $4.6 million of these bonds had an unsecured
liquidity facility available at December 31, 2004, for which the Company
compensated a bank through a commitment fee of 0.07%. There were no borrowings related to
this facility at December 31, 2004. The Company classified $9.5 million, $4.6 million and
$6.5 million of bonds currently subject to redemption options in current maturities of
long-term debt at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company’s debt instruments
include only standard affirmative and negative covenants that are normal in debt
instruments of similar amounts and structure. The Company’s debt instruments do not
contain financial or performance covenants restrictive to the business of the Company,
reflecting its strong financial position.

The Company is in compliance with all
debt covenants for the year ended December 31, 2004.

NOTE 15—LEASES

The Company leases certain land,
buildings and equipment. The Company capitalizes all significant leases that qualify for
capitalization, of which there were none at December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2004, the approximate
future minimum lease payments for all operating leases were as follows (in thousands of
dollars):

million and $18.8 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts are net of
sublease income of $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

NOTE 16—STOCK
INCENTIVE PLANS

The Company maintains stock incentive
plans under which the Company may grant a variety of incentive awards to employees. Shares
of common stock were authorized for issuance under the plans in connection with awards of
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units and
other stock-based awards.

The plans authorize the granting of
options to purchase shares at a price of not less than 100% of the closing market price on
the last trading day preceding the date of grant. All options expire no later than ten
years after the date of grant.

Shares relating to terminated,
surrendered or canceled options and stock appreciation rights, to forfeited restricted
stock or other awards, or to transactions that result in fewer shares being issued under
the plans, are again available for awards under the plans.


In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company
provided broad-based stock option grants covering 181,200, 161,300 and 89,600 shares,
respectively, to those employees who reached major service milestones and were not
participants in other stock option programs.

The plans authorize the granting of
restricted stock, which is held by the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions
related to the applicable grants. Except for the right of disposal, holders of restricted
stock have full shareholders’ rights during the period of restriction, including
voting rights and the right to receive dividends.

There were 10,000 shares of
restricted stock issued in 2004 with a weighted average fair market value of $50.66 per
share. There were 20,000 shares of restricted stock issued in 2003 with a weighted average
fair market value of $47.72 per share. There were 110,000 shares of restricted stock
issued in 2002 with a weighted average fair market value of $56.31 per share. The shares
granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 vest over periods from three to seven years from issuance,
although accelerated vesting is provided in certain instances. Restricted stock vested was
150,000, 96,790 and 112,000 shares in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Compensation
expense related to restricted stock awards is based upon closing market prices on the last
trading day preceding the date of grant and is charged to earnings on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period. Total compensation expense related to restricted stock was
$4.3 million, $4.8 million and $6.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There
were 5,000, 39,250 and 16,360 shares of restricted stock canceled in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. There were 322,000, 682,000 and 798,040 shares of restricted stock
outstanding at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and 912,120 shares
outstanding at January 1, 2002.

In 2004, the Company began issuing
restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of its long-term incentive program for management.
Awards of RSUs are provided for and are issued under the W.W. Grainger, Inc. 1990
Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as amended. There were 227,300 RSUs granted in 2004 with
an average fair market value of $53.43 per share. RSUs granted in 2004 vest over periods
from three to seven years from issuance, although accelerated vesting is provided in
certain instances. Holders of RSUs are entitled to receive cash payments equivalent to
cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to common stock.

In 2004, 215,000 shares of previously
granted, but unvested, restricted stock were converted into an equivalent number of RSUs.
In 2002, 95,720 shares of previously granted, but unvested restricted stock were converted
into an equivalent number of RSUs. The RSUs are subject to the same vesting provisions and
have the identical financial statement impact as the original restricted stock.

In 2004 and 2003, there were 48,900
and 95,720 RSUs, respectively, that vested. At various times after vesting, RSUs will be
settled by the issuance of stock certificates evidencing the conversion of the RSUs into
shares of the Company common stock on a one for one basis. There were 3,505 RSUs settled
and 23,600 RSUs canceled in 2004.

Compensation expense related to RSUs
is based upon closing market prices on the last trading day preceding the date of award
and is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Total
compensation expense related to restricted stock units was $4.7 million in 2004. At
December 31, 2004, there were 510,915 RSUs outstanding. At both December 31, 2003 and
2002, there were 95,720 RSUs outstanding. There were no RSUs outstanding at January 1,
2002.

Nonemployee directors participate in
the Company’s Director Stock Plan. A total of 327,760 shares of common stock are
available for issuance under the plan as of December 31, 2004.

A retainer fee for board service is
paid to nonemployee directors in the form of an annual award of unrestricted shares of
common stock under the Director Stock Plan. The number of shares awarded is equal to the
retainer fee divided by the fair market value of a share of common stock at the time of
the award, rounded up to the next ten-share increment. Total shares granted were 5,510,
6,160 and 5,850 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The weighted average fair market
value of these grants was $54.54, $45.50 and $54.61 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In addition, nonemployee directors
receive an annual grant under the Director Stock Plan, denominated in dollars, of options
to purchase shares of common stock. The number of shares covered by each option is equal
to the dollar amount of the grant divided by the fair market value of a share of common
stock at the time of the award, rounded to the next ten-share increment. The options are
issued at the closing market price on the last trading day preceding the date of grant.
The options are fully exercisable upon award and have a ten-year term. Total option awards
were 13,360, 15,840 and 14,850 shares in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No options
were canceled or expired in 2004, 2003 or 2002. There were 115,320, 112,470 and 96,630
options outstanding at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and 81,780 options
outstanding at January 1, 2002.


The Company awards stock units under
the Director Stock Plan in connection with deferrals of director fees and dividend
equivalents on existing stock units. A stock unit is the economic equivalent of a share of
common stock. Deferred fees and dividend equivalents on existing stock units are converted
into stock units on the basis of the market value of the stock at the relevant times.
Payment of the value of stock units is scheduled to be made after termination of service
as a director. As of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, there were ten, nine and ten
nonemployee directors, respectively, that held stock units. The Company recognized expense
(income) for the change in value of equivalent stock units of $0.9 million, $(1.0) million
and $0.5 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There were 2,087, 1,978 and 1,834
stock units issued as a result of deferrals of director fees and dividend equivalents in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total stock units outstanding were 39,398, 39,506 and
45,556 as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Transactions involving stock options
are summarized as follows:

All options were issued at the
closing market price on the last trading day preceding the date of grant. Options were
issued in 2004, 2003 and 2002 with initial vesting periods ranging from immediate to three
years.

NOTE 18—INCOME
TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes
under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” SFAS No.
109 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities,
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse.


Income tax expense consisted of:

The income tax effects of temporary
differences that gave rise to the net deferred tax asset were:

The purchased tax benefits represent
lease agreements acquired in prior years under the provisions of the Economic Recovery Act
of 1981.


At December 31, 2004, the Company had
$35.8 million of foreign operating loss carryforwards related to a foreign operation,
which begin to expire in 2006. The valuation allowance represents a provision for
uncertainty as to the realization of the tax benefits of these carryforwards.

In addition, the Company recorded a
valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be
realized due to capital loss limitations.

The changes in the valuation
allowance were as follows:

The Company has not provided for U.S.
federal income taxes or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings or losses of its
foreign subsidiaries. In the opinion of management, such earnings will continue to be
indefinitely reinvested. At December 31, 2004, there were no undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries that would be subject to U.S. income taxes, if such earnings were
repatriated.

The Company is continuously
undergoing examination of its federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service
(the IRS). The Company and the IRS have settled tax years through 2001. The IRS is
currently examining the Company’s 2002 and 2003 federal income tax returns.
Additionally, the Company is routinely involved in state and local income tax audits, and
on occasion, foreign jurisdiction tax audits. The Company expects to resolve these audits
within the amounts paid and/or reserved for these liabilities.

NOTE 19—EARNINGS
PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is based on
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per
share is based on the combination of weighted average number of shares outstanding and
dilutive potential shares. The Company had additional outstanding stock options of 2.7
million, 3.5 million and 2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share
because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the
common stock.


The following table sets forth the
computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

NOTE 20—PREFERRED
SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

The Company has a Shareholder Rights
Plan, under which there is outstanding one preferred share purchase right (Right) for each
outstanding share of the Company’s common stock. Each Right, under certain
circumstances, may be exercised to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A-1999
Junior Participating Preferred Stock (intended to be the economic equivalent of one share
of the Company’s common stock) at a price of $250.00, subject to adjustment. The
Rights become exercisable only after a person or a group, other than a person or group
exempt under the plan, acquires or announces a tender offer for 15% or more of the
Company’s common stock. If a person or group, other than a person or group exempt
under the plan, acquires 15% or more of the Company’s common stock or if the Company
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, each Right generally
entitles the holder, other than such person or group, to purchase, at the then-current
exercise price, stock and/or other securities or assets of the Company or the acquiring
company having a market value of twice the exercise price.

The Rights expire on May 15, 2009,
unless earlier redeemed. They generally are redeemable at $.001 per Right until thirty
days following announcement that a person or group, other than a person or group exempt
under the plan, has acquired 15% or more of the Company’s common stock. The Rights do
not have voting or dividend rights and, until they become exercisable, have no dilutive
effect on the earnings of the Company.

NOTE 21—SEGMENT
INFORMATION

The Company reports three segments:
Branch-based Distribution, Lab Safety and Integrated Supply. The Branch-based Distribution
segment provides customers with solutions to their immediate facilities maintenance and
other needs. Branch-based Distribution is an aggregation of the following: Industrial
Supply, Acklands (Canada), FindMRO, Export, Global Sourcing, Parts,
Grainger, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), Grainger Caribe Inc. (Puerto Rico)
and China Distribution. Lab Safety is a direct marketer of safety and other industrial
products. Integrated Supply serves customers who have chosen to outsource a portion or all
of their indirect materials management processes.

The Company’s segments offer
differing ranges of services and products and require different resources and marketing
strategies. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. Intersegment transfer prices are established
at external selling prices, less costs not incurred due to a related party sale.

Long-lived assets consist of
property, buildings, equipment, capitalized software, goodwill and other intangibles.

Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer.

Unallocated expenses and unallocated
assets primarily relate to the Company headquarters’ support services, which are not
part of any business segment. Unallocated expenses include payroll and benefits,
depreciation and other costs associated with headquarters-related support services.
Unallocated assets include nonoperating cash and cash equivalents, certain prepaid
expenses and property, buildings and equipment – net. Unallocated expenses increased
$21.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared with the prior year. The
year-over-year variance included increases in payroll and benefits at headquarters driven
by stock-based compensation, and bonus and profit sharing accruals, as well as higher
severance and benefits related to organizational changes made during 2004.


The change in the carrying amount of
goodwill by segment from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2004 is as follows:

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the
Company reduced its income tax rate for the year to 35.5% from its previous projection of
38.0%. This reduction was primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits from the
Medicare Act, capital loss carrybacks created by the sale of investment securities and the
resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies. The reduction in rate was not
determinable until the fourth quarter when these items were finalized and their effect on
the rate quantified.


NOTE 23—RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTION

On February 28, 2002, the Company
purchased substantially all of the assets, consisting of 4,801,600 shares of Company
common stock and cash, of Mountain Capital Corporation, a Nevada corporation (MCC). In
exchange, the Company transferred to MCC 4,695,725 shares of Company common stock. The
number of shares transferred reflected a 1.5% discount (72,024 shares) from the number of
shares received, and additionally reflected other adjustments designed to reimburse the
Company for its direct transaction expenses of $0.6 million (10,549 shares) and for the
Company’s payment of indebtedness of MCC of $1.3 million (23,302 shares). The effect
on the Company of this transaction was to increase the number of shares held as Treasury
stock, thereby reducing the number of shares outstanding by 105,875 shares. The shares
received by MCC from the Company were subsequently distributed to the MCC shareholders
pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation of MCC.

The transaction documentation
includes:

(i)

a Purchase Agreement containing the terms and conditions of the transaction;

(ii)

an Escrow Agreement providing for the pledge by MCC of 10% of the shares
          received in the transaction, and the pledge by the MCC shareholders of the
          escrowed shares, as security for the indemnification obligations and liabilities
          of MCC and the MCC shareholders and

(iii)

a Share Transfer Restriction Agreement providing for certain restrictions on the
          transfer of Company common stock received by or otherwise held by the MCC
          shareholders and certain other parties to that agreement.

Prior to the transaction, James D.
Slavik, a Company director, was the president and a director of MCC. In addition, Mr.
Slavik and certain members of his family owned all of the outstanding stock of MCC either
directly or indirectly, including through family trusts of which Mr. Slavik served as
trustee. Mr. Slavik was not present and did not participate in any of the deliberations of
the Board of Directors or any of its committees relating to the review, consideration or
approval of the transaction.

NOTE 24—UNCLASSIFIED – NET

The components of Unclassified –
net were as follows:

NOTE 25—CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS

The Company has an outstanding
guarantee relating to an industrial revenue bond assumed by the buyer of one of the
Company’s formerly owned facilities. The maximum exposure under this guarantee is
$8.5 million. The Company has not recorded any liability relating to this guarantee and
believes it is unlikely that material payments will be required.

The Company has been named, along
with numerous other nonaffiliated companies, as a defendant in litigation in various
states involving asbestos and/or silica. These lawsuits typically assert claims of
personal injury arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and/or silica as a consequence
of products purportedly distributed by the Company. As of January 28, 2005, the Company is
named in cases filed on behalf of approximately 3,700 plaintiffs in which there is an
allegation of exposure to asbestos and/or silica. In addition, during 2004, five cases
previously filed against the Company alleging exposure to cotton dust were amended to
include allegations relating to asbestos; these cases involve approximately 2,100
plaintiffs.


The Company has denied, or intends to
deny, the allegations in all of the above-described lawsuits. In 2004, lawsuits relating
to asbestos and/or silica and involving approximately 700 plaintiffs were dismissed with
respect to the Company, typically based on the lack of product identification. If a
specific product distributed by the Company is identified in any of these lawsuits, it
would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer. In
addition, the Company believes that a substantial portion of these claims are covered by
insurance. The Company is engaged in active discussions with its insurance carriers
regarding the scope and amount of coverage. While the Company is unable to predict the
outcome of these lawsuits, it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

On September 28, 2004, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) filed an administrative complaint against the
Company seeking a civil penalty of $0.4 million for alleged violations of federal
clean-air law and regulations. The complaint alleges that the Company sold a
“non-essential” wheel chock product which contained and/or was manufactured with
an ozone-depleting substance (ODS). The complaint also alleges that the Company sold
aerosol cleaning fluids containing an ODS without displaying proper notification where the
products were sold. According to the complaint, the Company sold the cleaning fluids to
persons who did not provide proof that they were commercial purchasers and failed to
verify that such persons were commercial purchasers. The Company does not believe that the
resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

In addition to the foregoing, from
time to time the Company is involved in various other legal and administrative proceedings
that are incidental to its business. These include claims relating to product liability,
general negligence, environmental issues, employment, intellectual property and other
matters. As a government contractor, from time to time the Company is also subject to
governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits. It is not expected that the ultimate
resolution of any of these matters will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 26—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On January 7, 2005, Lab Safety, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a definitive agreement to acquire
substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of AW Direct, Inc. (AW Direct). AW
Direct is a direct marketer of products to the service vehicle accessories market. The
acquisition subsequently closed on January 14, 2005. The final purchase price is expected
to be approximately $25 million in cash and approximately $2 million in assumed
liabilities. Any goodwill recognized in this transaction will be deductible for tax
purposes.

AW Direct, with 2004 sales of more
than $28 million, sells general towing and work truck equipment and accessories to
customers in the auto service, utilities, government and construction markets. AW Direct
will be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lab Safety.
