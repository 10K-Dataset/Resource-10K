PART I

Item 1: Business

The Company

W.W. Grainger, Inc., incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, is a broad-line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions primarily in the United States and Canada, with expanding global operations. In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives, direct marketing materials,  catalogs and eCommerce. Grainger serves approximately

2.0 million

customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers, multiple websites and export services.

During 2011,

Grainger acquired the Fabory Group, a European distributor of fasteners and related maintenance, repair and operating products, representing Grainger's first entry into the European market.  See the Other Businesses  discussion below for a description of this business.

Grainger’s two reportable segments are the United States and Canada. The United States segment reflects the results of Grainger’s U.S. business. The Canada segment reflects the results for Acklands – Grainger Inc. (Acklands – Grainger), Grainger’s Canadian business. Other businesses include the following significant operations: the Fabory Group, MonotaRO, Mexico, China and Colombia. These businesses generate revenue through the distribution of maintenance, repair and operating supplies and products and provide related services. For segment and geographical information and consolidated net sales and operating earnings see “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Grainger has centralized business support functions that provide coordination and guidance in the areas of accounting and finance, business development, communications and investor relations, compensation and benefits, information systems, health and safety, global supply chain functions, human resources, risk management, internal audit, legal, real estate, security, tax and treasury. These services are provided in varying degrees to all business units.

Grainger does not engage in product research and development activities. Items are regularly added to and deleted from Grainger’s product lines on the basis of customer demand, market research, recommendations of suppliers, sales volumes and other factors.

United States

The United States business offers a broad selection of maintenance, repair and operating supplies and other related products and services through local branches, catalogs and the Internet. A combination of product breadth, local availability, speed of delivery, detailed product information and competitively priced products and services is provided by this business. Products offered include material handling equipment, safety and security supplies, lighting and electrical products, power and hand tools, pumps and plumbing supplies, cleaning and maintenance supplies, forestry and agriculture equipment, building and home inspection supplies, vehicle and fleet components and many other items primarily focused on the facilities maintenance market. Services offered include inventory management and energy efficiency solutions.

The United States business operates in all 50 states through a network of


branches. These branches are located in close proximity to the majority of U.S. businesses and serve the immediate needs of customers in their local markets by allowing them to pick up items directly from the branches. Branches range in size from small branches to large master branches. The branch network has approximately

4,700

employees who primarily fulfill counter and will-call product purchases and provide customer service. An average branch is

23,000

square feet in size, has


employees and handles about


transactions per day. In the normal course of business, Grainger continually reviews the effectiveness of its branch network. In 2011,


branches were closed and one opened.  The number of branch closures during 2011 reflects the shift of volume from counter and will-call purchases to shipments out of the distribution centers.

The logistics network in the United States is comprised of a network of


distribution centers (DCs) of various sizes.  In 2011, a new DC was opened and began operations in northern California.  Automated equipment and processes in the larger DCs allow them to handle the majority of the customer shipping for next-day product availability and replenish the branches that provide same day availability.


Customers range from small and medium-sized businesses to large corporations, government entities and other institutions. They are primarily represented by purchasing managers or workers in facilities maintenance departments and service shops across a wide range of industries such as manufacturing, hospitality, transportation, government, retail, healthcare and education. Sales transactions during


were made to approximately

1.6 million

customers averaging

105,000

daily transactions. No single customer accounted for more than

2%

of total sales.

The business has a sales force of almost

2,700

professionals who help businesses and institutions select the right products to find immediate solutions to maintenance problems and to reduce operating expenses and improve cash flows.  The sales force increased over the prior year with the majority of the new sales representatives focused on acquiring additional business from existing medium-sized customers as well as acquiring new business across the United States.

Another area in which the United States business helps customers be more productive is through inventory management.  A comprehensive program was launched in 2006 called KeepStock® that includes on-site services and vendor-managed inventory.  During the past couple of years the program has expanded to over 14,000 customers and 30,000 unique customer installations.

Customers can also purchase products through grainger.com. More customers are migrating to online and electronic purchasing and Grainger continues to enhance its eCommerce platform.  With access to more than

800,000

products, grainger.com serves as a prominent channel for the United States business. Grainger.com provides real-time price and product availability and detailed product information, and offers advanced features such as product search and compare capabilities. For customers with sophisticated electronic purchasing platforms, Grainger utilizes technology that allows these systems to communicate directly with grainger.com. Customers can also purchase products through several other branded websites.

The majority of the products sold by the United States business are well recognized national branded products, including private label items bearing Grainger’s registered trademarks, such as DAYTON® motors, SPEEDAIRE® air compressors, AIR HANDLER® air filtration equipment, DEM-KOTE® spray paints, WESTWARD® tools, CONDOR® safety products and LUMAPRO® lighting products. Grainger has taken steps to protect these trademarks against infringement and believes that they will remain available for future use in its business.

The Grainger catalog, most recently issued in

February 2012

, offers approximately

410,000

facilities maintenance and other products and is used by customers to assist in product selection. Approximately

2.1 million

copies of the catalog were produced. In addition, Grainger’s United States business issues targeted catalogs for its multiple branded products, as well as other marketing materials.

The United States business purchases products for sale from more than

2,000

key suppliers, most of which are manufacturers. Through a global sourcing operation, the business procures competitively priced, high-quality products produced outside the United States from approximately


suppliers. Grainger sells these items primarily under private label brands. Products obtained through the global sourcing operation include DAYTON® motors, WESTWARD® tools, LUMAPRO® lighting products and CONDOR® safety products, as well as products bearing other trademarks. No single supplier comprised more than

5%

of total purchases and no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply.

Canada

Acklands – Grainger is Canada’s leading broad-line distributor of industrial and safety supplies.  A combination of product breadth, local availability, speed of delivery, detailed product information and competitively priced products and services is provided by this business.

In 2011,

Acklands – Grainger acquired one business, Fercomat, Inc.  Fercomat is based in Quebec and has been a leading distributor of hardware, tools and fasteners since 1957.

The Canadian business serves customers through


branches and

six

DCs across Canada. Acklands – Grainger distributes tools, fasteners, safety supplies, instruments, welding and shop equipment, and many other items.

During 2011,

approximately

15,000

sales transactions were completed daily. A comprehensive catalog, printed in both English and French, was most recently issued in

February 2012

.  The catalog has more than

110,000

products and is used by customers to assist in product selection. In addition, customers can purchase products through acklandsgrainger.com, a fully bilingual website.

Other Businesses

Included in other businesses are the operations in Europe, Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China, Colombia, Panama and Dominican Republic. The more significant businesses in this group are described below.


Fabory Group

In 2011, Grainger acquired the Fabory Group, a European distributor of fasteners, tools and industrial supplies.  The Fabory Group is headquartered in Tilburg, the Netherlands, and has more than 100 locations in 15 countries.  Customers have access to approximately 80,000 products through a catalog and through fabory.com.

Japan

Grainger operates in Japan through its

53%

interest in MonotaRO Co. MonotaRO provides small and mid-sized domestic businesses with products that help them operate and maintain their facilities. MonotaRO is a catalog and  web-based direct marketer with approximately

80%

of orders being conducted through monotaro.com.  MonotaRO has no branches and fulfills all orders from two DCs.

Mexico

Grainger’s operations in Mexico provide local businesses with maintenance, repair and operating supplies and other related products primarily from Mexico and the United States. Mexico distributes products through a network of branches and one DC where customers have access to approximately

84,000

products through a Spanish-language catalog and through grainger.com.mx.

China

Grainger operates in China from a DC in Shanghai and two small regional warehouses. In addition, there are

six

sales offices in eastern China that allow sales representatives to work remotely and meet with customers. Customers have access to approximately

59,000

products through a Chinese-language catalog and through grainger.com.cn.

Colombia

Grainger owns an

80%

position in a joint venture in Colombia. Colombia provides businesses with facilities maintenance supplies and other products, with an emphasis on fastener products, through a network of branches and one DC. Customers have access to approximately

30,000

products through torhefe.com.

Seasonality

Grainger’s business in general is not seasonal, however, there are some products that typically sell more often during the winter or summer season. In any given month, unusual weather patterns, i.e., unusually hot or cold weather, could impact the sales volumes of these products, either positively or negatively.

Competition

Grainger faces competition in all markets it serves, from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and Internet-based businesses.

Grainger provides local product availability, a broad product line, sales representatives, competitive pricing, catalogs (which include product descriptions and, in certain cases, extensive technical and application data), and electronic and Internet commerce technology. Other services such as inventory management and energy efficiency solutions to assist customers in lowering their total facilities maintenance costs are also offered. Grainger believes that it can effectively compete with manufacturers on small orders, but manufacturers may have an advantage in filling large orders.

Grainger serves a number of diverse markets.  Grainger estimates the North American market for facilities maintenance and related products to be approximately

$140 billion

, of which Grainger’s share is approximately

5%

. There are several large competitors, although the majority of the market is served by small local and regional competitors.

Employees

As of December 31, 2011

, Grainger had approximately

21,400

employees, of whom approximately

20,000

were full-time and

1,400

were part-time or temporary. Grainger has never had a major work stoppage and considers employee relations to be good.

Website Access to Company Reports

Grainger makes available, through its website, free of charge, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after this material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 1A: Risk Factors

The following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to Grainger's business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations.

Weakness in the economy could negatively impact Grainger's sales growth.

Economic and industry trends affect Grainger's business environments. Economic downturns can cause customers, both domestic and international, to idle or close facilities, delay purchases and otherwise reduce their ability to purchase Grainger's products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments. Thus, a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity in the United States, Canada or any other major world economy could negatively impact Grainger's sales growth and results of operations.

The facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented, and changes in competition could result in a decreased demand for Grainger's products and services.

There are several large competitors in the industry, although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Grainger faces competition in all markets it serves, from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and Internet-based businesses. Competitive pressures could adversely affect Grainger's sales and profitability.

Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect operating margins.

Some of Grainger's products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. Increases in the price of fuel could also drive up transportation costs. Grainger's ability to pass on increases in costs depends on market conditions. The inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower operating margins. In addition, higher prices could impact demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes.

Unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships, resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations.

Grainger's competitive strengths include product selection and availability. Products are purchased from more than 3,500 key suppliers located in various countries around the world, no one of which accounted for more than 5% of total purchases. Historically, no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply; however, disruptions could occur due to factors beyond Grainger's control, such as economic downturns, political unrest, trade issues, etc., any of which could adversely affect a supplier's ability to manufacture or deliver products. If Grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products, there could be a short-term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer-term adverse effect on customer relationships and Grainger's reputation. In addition, Grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors. In the event Grainger was unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.

The addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth.

Grainger is continuing in a multiyear product line expansion program. The continued success of this program is expected to be a driver of growth in 2012 and beyond. Its success will depend on Grainger's ability to accurately forecast market demand, obtain products from suppliers and effectively integrate these products into the supply chain. As such, there is a risk that the product line expansion program will not deliver the expected results, which could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth.

Disruptions in Grainger's supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.

A disruption within Grainger's logistics or supply chain network, including damage, destruction, and other events which would cause one or more of the distribution centers to become non-operational, could adversely affect Grainger's ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, impair Grainger's ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to Grainger's reputation. Such a disruption could adversely impact the results of operations.

Interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues.

The proper functioning of Grainger's information systems, including its websites, is critical to the successful operation of its business. Grainger continues to invest in software, hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems and websites. Although Grainger's information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, computer viruses, telecommunication failures and other problems. If critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable, among other things, Grainger's ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable and disburse funds could be adversely affected.  Any such interruption of Grainger's information systems could also subject Grainger to additional costs.


Breaches of information systems security could damage Grainger's reputation, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues.

Through Grainger's sales and eCommerce channels, Grainger collects and stores confidential information that customers provide to, among other things, purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs and register on the website. Grainger also acquires and retains information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, computer hackers may attempt to penetrate Grainger's or its vendors' information systems and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer, supplier, employee or other business information. In addition, a Grainger employee, contractor or other third party with whom Grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer, supplier, employee or other business information could disrupt operations, damage Grainger's reputation, and expose Grainger to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on Grainger, its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant additional expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.

Fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of operations.

Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations have an impact on sales, costs and cash flows from international operations, and could affect reported financial performance.

Acquisitions involve a number of inherent risks, any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations.

Acquisitions, both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties in assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability of acquired companies. There is a risk of potential losses of key employees of an acquired business and of an inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition. Additionally, problems could arise from the integration of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in the business or industry, or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Any one or more of these factors could cause Grainger not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could become impaired.

In order to compete, Grainger must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations.

In order to compete and have continued growth, Grainger must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing and support positions. Grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Grainger's operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.

Grainger's continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Grainger's reputation.

One of the reasons why customers choose to do business with Grainger and why employees choose Grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that Grainger has built over many years. To be successful in the future, Grainger must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of Grainger's brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Grainger's brand and lead to adverse effects on Grainger's business.

Grainger's business is subject to various government regulations.

Grainger's business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where it operates and compliance with these laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business. As a government contractor selling to federal, state and local government entities, Grainger is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including without limitation import and export requirements, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, and is also subject to audits and inquiries in the ordinary course of business. Changes to the legal and regulatory environments could increase the cost of doing business, and such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. Furthermore, Grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or Grainger's policies. Any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect Grainger's financial condition or operating results.

Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

General

. Grainger is a broad-line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies, and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions. Grainger’s operations are primarily in the United States and Canada, with an expanding presence in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives, catalogs and direct marketing materials and eCommerce. Grainger serves approximately

2.0

million customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers, multiple websites and export services.

Grainger’s two reportable segments are the United States and Canada. The United States segment reflects the results of Grainger’s U.S. operating segment. The Canada segment reflects the results for Acklands – Grainger Inc., Grainger’s Canadian operating segment. Other Businesses include the following significant operating segments which are not material individually and in the aggregate: Fabory Group, MonotaRO, Mexico, China and Colombia.

Business Environment

.

Several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape Grainger’s business environment. The overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting Grainger’s growth. Historically, Grainger’s sales have tended to correlate with industrial production and non-farm payrolls. According to the Federal Reserve, overall industrial production increased

2.9%

from December 2010 to December 2011. The United States’ GDP grew an estimated

1.7%

in 2011 and Canada’s GDP grew an estimated

2.3%

. The improvement in the economy has positively affected Grainger’s sales growth for 2011.  In addition, changes in business inventory levels are a factor in Grainger's sales trends.  The need for businesses to replenish inventories in 2010 and 2011 after the economic downturn contributed to Grainger's sales growth.  According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, inventory levels increased 3.5% and 2.1% in 2010 and 2011, respectively.

In February 2012, Consensus Forecasts-USA projected 2012 Industrial Production growth of

3.4%

, GDP growth of

2.2%

and business inventory growth of 2.5% for the United States.  In addition, Consensus Forecasts-USA projected GDP growth of

2.0%

for Canada.

The light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised approximately 27% of Grainger’s total 2011 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. Manufacturing employment levels in the United States increased approximately

2.0%

from December 2010 to December 2011, while manufacturing output increased

1.3%

. This increase in manufacturing employment and output contributed to a mid-teen percent increase in the heavy manufacturing customer sector and a high single-digit percent increase in the light manufacturing customer sector for Grainger in 2011.

Outlook

. Grainger plans to continue to make investments in growth drivers such as product line expansion, sales force expansion, eCommerce, inventory services, distribution centers and international expansion.  These multi-year initiatives are expected to contribute to continued market share growth by helping businesses and institutions streamline their purchasing processes and reduce costs.  As of January 25, 2012, Grainger forecasted 2012 sales growth to be in the range of 10 to 14%.  Volume growth is expected to contribute 5 to 8% of the sales growth, price 2 to 3% and acquisitions an additional 3%.  Earnings per share is forecasted to be in the range of $9.90 to $10.65 for the full year of 2012, reflecting higher sales growth and gross profit margin expansion, partially offset by growth investments.  The guidance anticipated continued strong organic growth with increased investments.  The forecasted gross profit margins, while expected to continue to expand, will also be tempered by faster growth from larger, contract customers with lower gross profit margins.  Operating expenses as a percent of sales is expected to improve in 2012, although the cost leverage provided by faster growth and productivity improvements will be partially offset by the continued investments in the growth drivers.

2010 Compared to 2009

Grainger's net sales of $7,182.2 million for 2010 increased 15.4% when compared with net sales of $6,222.0 million for 2009. There was one less selling day in 2010 versus 2009.  Daily sales were up 15.9%.  For 2010, approximately 10 percentage points of the sales growth came from an increase in volume, 4 percentage points came from business acquisitions, and 2 percentage points due to foreign exchange.  Sales of products used to assist with the oil spill cleanup in the Gulf of Mexico and sales of seasonal products each contributed approximately 1 percentage point to the volume growth for 2010.   Sales to all customer end-markets increased for 2010.  The overall increase in net sales was led by a 30 percent increase to reseller customers, driven by sales of products used in the oil spill cleanup, a high-teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers, followed by a low double-digit increase in light manufacturing.  Refer to the

Segment Analysis

below for further details.

Gross profit of $3,005.7 million for 2010 increased 15.7%.  The gross profit margin for 2010 was 41.8%, flat versus 2009.  The gross profit margin was favorably affected by flat prices while product costs decreased, offset by faster sales growth from the lower margin international businesses and by an increase in sales to large customers, which are generally at lower margins.

Operating expenses of $2,145.2 million for 2010 increased 11.0% from $1,933.3 million for 2009. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher commissions, bonuses and profit sharing costs due to improved performance, partially offset by a $33.1 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change, which reduced the related liability.

Operating earnings of $860.5 million for 2010 increased 29.4% from $665.2 million for 2009.  The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the strong sales growth and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales.


Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2010 increased by 18.7% to $510.9 million from $430.5 million in 2009. The increase in net earnings for 2010 primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings.  Diluted earnings per share of $6.93 in 2010 were 23.3% higher than $5.62 for 2009, due to increased net earnings and fewer shares outstanding.  There were two non-cash items included in 2010 earnings, a $0.28 per share benefit from a change to a paid time off policy and a $0.15 per share tax expense related to the tax treatment of retiree healthcare benefits following the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which when combined, resulted in a net benefit of $0.13 per share.  Results for 2009 included a $0.37 per share non-cash gain from the MonotaRO transaction in September 2009.  Excluding these items from both years, net earnings increased 29.4% and earnings per share increased 29.5% in 2010 versus 2009.

Segment Analysis

The following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

United States

Net sales were $6,020.1 million for 2010, an increase of $574.7 million, or 10.6%, when compared with net sales of $5,445.4 million for 2009.  Daily sales in the United States were up 11.0%.  Approximately 9 percentage points of the sales growth came from an increase in volume.  In addition, acquisitions and price each added 1 percentage point.  Sales to all customer end-markets except contractor customers increased for 2010.  The overall increase in net sales was led by a mid-20 percent increase to reseller customers driven by the sales of products used to assist in the oil spill cleanup, a high-teen percent increase to heavy manufacturing customers and a low double-digit increase to light manufacturing customers.

The segment gross profit margin increased 0.6 percentage point in 2010 over 2009.  The gross profit margin benefited from price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by an increase in sales to large customers, which are generally at lower margins.

Operating expenses were up 6.0% for 2010 versus 2009.  Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher commissions, bonus expense and profit sharing costs due to improved performance, partially offset by a $29.7 million benefit that resulted from a paid time off policy change, which reduced the related liability.

For the segment, operating earnings of $920.2 million for 2010 increased 25.1% over $735.6 million in 2009.  The improvement in operating earnings for 2010 was primarily due to an increase in net sales and gross profit margin, and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales.

Canada

Net sales were $820.9 million for 2010, an increase of $169.7 million, or 26.1%, when compared with $651.2 million for 2009.  Daily sales were up 26.6%.  In local currency, daily sales increased 14.9% for 2010.  Contributing to the sales growth was 3 percentage points for acquisitions.  The increase in net sales was led by growth to oil and gas, construction, and agriculture and mining customers.

The gross profit margin increased 0.4 percentage point in 2010 over 2009, primarily driven by lower product costs including the positive effect of foreign currency exchange on buying products in U.S. dollars.

Operating expenses increased 32.0% in 2010.  In local currency, operating expenses increased 19.7% primarily due to increased payroll and benefits costs including higher commissions and bonus expense, increased volume-related headcount and incremental costs for acquisitions made over the last year.  Non-payroll related expenses also increased driven by higher travel, entertainment and advertising due to the sponsorship of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, and increased occupancy and warehouse costs driven in part by the incremental costs for a distribution center opened in the 2010 second quarter.

Operating earnings of $46.8 million for 2010 were up $3.1 million, or 7.1%, versus 2009 due to the foreign exchange rate impact. In local currency, operating earnings decreased 1% primarily due to increased operating expenses as discussed above.


Other Businesses

Net sales for other businesses, which include the following significant operations: MonotaRO, Mexico, China and Colombia, were up 136.1% for 2010.  Daily sales increased 137.0%.  The increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of results for Japan after obtaining controlling interest in September 2009 and Colombia, acquired in June 2010, along with strong growth from all the other international businesses.  Operating earnings for other businesses were $11.7 million for 2010 compared to operating losses of $11.6 million for 2009.

Other Income and Expense

Other income and expense was $6.7 million of expense in 2010 compared with $42.1 million of income in 2009.  The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars):

The change from net income to net expense was primarily attributable to the non-cash gain of $47.4 million in 2009 from the step-up of the investment in MonotaRO after Grainger became a majority owner.

Income Taxes

Income taxes of $340.2 million in 2010 increased 23.0% as compared with $276.6 million in 2009.  Grainger's effective tax rates were 39.8% and 39.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the tax rate in 2010 was primarily driven by a one-time tax expense related to the U.S. healthcare legislation passed in the first quarter of 2010.  Excluding this tax expense, the 2010 effective tax rate was 39.1%.


Financial Condition

Grainger expects its strong working capital position, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue, allowing it to fund its operations, including growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchase of shares, as well as to pay cash dividends.

Cash Flow

Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010

Cash from operating activities continues to serve as Grainger's primary source of liquidity.  Net cash flows from operations in 2011 were $746.1 million and increased $149.7 million from $596.4 million in 2010.  The primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of $152.8 million.  Higher accounts receivable and inventory balances, driven by growth in sales volumes and a new distribution center in northern California, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable, reduced the operating cash flow from net earnings.

Net cash used in investing activities of $535.1 million in 2011 was driven by net cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and software of $189.7 million and net cash paid for business acquisitions of $359.3 million. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the

Capital Expenditures

section below. Net cash used in investing activities was $365.9 million more than in 2010 due primarily to an increase in net cash paid for business acquisitions of $297.2 million versus 2010.

Net cash used in financing activities of $177.4 million in 2011 decreased $401.2 million from $578.6 million in 2010.      The decrease was primarily due to lower treasury shares repurchases in 2011 versus 2010.  Cash paid for treasury share purchases was $151.1 million in 2011 versus $504.8 million in 2010, a reduction of $353.7 million.

Fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009

Net cash flows from operations of $596.4 million in 2010 decreased $136.0 million from $732.4 million in 2009.  Excluding business acquisitions, the decrease was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable of $127.8 million and inventories of $80.5 million, driven by the higher sales volumes.  The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net earnings.

Net cash used in investing activities of $169.2 million in 2010 decreased $93.4 million versus $262.6 million in 2009.  Net cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and software of $120.6 million decreased $20.1 million from $140.7 million in 2009. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the

Capital Expenditures

section below. In addition, net cash paid for business acquisitions decreased $61.0 million versus 2009.

Net cash used in financing activities of $578.6 million in 2010 increased $165.1 million from $413.5 million in 2009.  Grainger repaid $239.1 million of long-term debt in 2010 and issued $200.0 million of commercial paper, resulting in a net use of cash.  Cash paid for treasury share purchases of $504.8 million was $132.1 million higher than $372.7 million in 2009. Grainger repurchased 4.6 million shares in 2010 compared to 4.5 million shares in 2009.

Working Capital

Internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt. In addition, funds are expended on facilities to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements.

Working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was $

1,307.0 million

at December 31, 2011, compared with $

1,368.8 million

at December 31, 2010.  At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was

1.9

and

2.6

.  The $61.8 million decrease in working capital and lower current ratio was primarily due to an increase in current maturities of long-term debt and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory.  The changes were primarily driven by higher sales volumes, the acquisition of the Fabory Group and a new distribution center in northern California.


Capital Expenditures

In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table (in thousands of dollars):

In 2011, significant expenditures were made to build new distribution centers in the United States and for distribution center expansion in Canada.  Also, a large investment was made to update and improve the eCommerce platform in the United States business.  Finally, the Company continued to invest in new and existing international businesses, as well as for normal recurring replacement of equipment.

In 2010 and 2009, significant capital expenditures included investments in the distribution center network in the U.S. and Canada.  Additional expenditures were for normal recurring replacement of equipment.

Capital expenditures are expected to range from $200 million to $225 million in 2012.   Projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain (primarily the new Chicago distribution center and distribution centers in Canada), technology infrastructure, and continued investments in eCommerce.  Grainger expects to fund 2012 capital investments from operating cash flows.

Debt

Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit.  Refer to Notes 7 and 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was

15.9%

and 17.8% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily due to increased retained earnings associated with strong earnings in 2011.  Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.


Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations

At December 31, 2011, Grainger's contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows (in thousands of dollars):

Purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract.

Other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections, and other employee benefit plans. Other employment-related benefits costs of $60.3 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

See also Notes 8 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to the interest on long-term debt and operating lease obligations, respectively.

Grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of $23.9 million for tax uncertainties and interest at December 31, 2011. This amount is excluded from the table above, as Grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements.  Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value.


Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger's results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.

Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made, which would have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger's financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations.

Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

.

Grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables, the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer.  Based on analysis of actual historical write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable, Grainger's estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts.  However, write-offs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends, and Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes.  For years 2011, 2010 and 2009, actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts.

Inventory Reserves

.

Grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory.

Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss.  For fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts.

Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities.  Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value.  Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values.  As Grainger's inventory consists of approximately 900,000 stocked products, it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a SKU level and no individual SKU is material.   There were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of write-offs historically.  Grainger's methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date.  Actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on Grainger's results of operations based on significant changes in product demand, market conditions or liquidation value.  If business or economic conditions change, Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate.  For fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts.

Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets

.

Grainger's business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment write-downs that may occur in future periods. Grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Grainger tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level.


During the fourth quarter of 2011, Grainger early adopted the Financial Accounting Standard Board's new accounting guidance, which allows companies to assess qualitative factors such as a reporting unit's current performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Grainger completed the annual impairment testing using the qualitative approach for all of its reporting units and the two-step quantitative test for one of its reporting units with the carrying value of goodwill of $17 million. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no indication of impairment existed as of the test date.  Grainger uses the discounted cash flow method to derive the fair value of a reporting unit.  The discounted cash flow method requires considerable management judgment, assumptions and estimates regarding future profitability and cash flows of its reporting units and general market conditions, including terminal growth rate and discount rate assumptions.  Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these unobservable Level 3 inputs, the results of these tests may differ and impairment charges could occur in future periods.  While Grainger will continue to consider the economic environment and other pertinent factors that may have an adverse effect on its reporting units, there can be no assurance that Grainger's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows or other inputs used in forecasting the fair value of future cash flows will prove to be accurate projections.

Stock Incentive Plans

.

Grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors. Grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants. The model requires projections of the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants. The fair value of options granted in 2011, 2010 and 2009 used the following assumptions:

The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders' exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of Grainger's stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant. Historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions.  Because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience.

The amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions. If a different valuation model or different assumptions were used, the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period.

Compensation expense for other stock-based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant.

For additional information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Postretirement Healthcare Benefits

.

Postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts.  The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates, and certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality rates. Changes in these and other assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger's postretirement benefit obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation.


The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year.  A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs.  As of December 31, 2011, Grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 5.6% to 4.5% to reflect the decrease in market interest rates.  Grainger estimates that this decrease could reduce 2012 pretax earnings by approximately $9.1 million.  However, other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect.

Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Total International Composite Index in developing its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2011, Grainger maintained the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% (net of tax at 40%) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return.

A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on December 31, 2011 results (in thousands of dollars):

Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable.

Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and, therefore, may affect Grainger's retirement plan obligations and future expense.  For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Insurance Reserves

.

Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers' compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self-insured retentions.  There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance.

Grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves.  Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns.  Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels.  In calculating the liability, historical trends, claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made.

The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time.  Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period's results of operations.  Grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied.  There were no material adjustments based on Grainger's historical experience in 2011, 2010 and 2009.  If actual trends, including the nature, severity or frequency of claims differ from our estimates, or if business or economic conditions change, Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted.

Income Taxes

.

Grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management's interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger's best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities and uncertain tax positions.


Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger.

Other

.

Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies such as revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets, fair value measurements and valuations, and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inflation

Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements.

Some of Grainger's products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. Grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations.

Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Form 10-K contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans, strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” under the federal securities laws. Grainger has generally identified such forward-looking statements by using words such as “anticipate, anticipated, assumed, assumes, assumption, assumptions, believe, believes, can, continue, continued, continues, continues to believe it has complied, continuing, could, estimate, estimated, estimates, expect, expectation, expected, expects, forecast, forecasts, if, intend, intended, intends, may, might, plans, predict, predictable, presumption, project, projected, projecting, projection, projections, potential, potentially, reasonably likely, scheduled, should, strategy, tended, timing and outcome are uncertain, unanticipated, will, will be realized, and would” or similar expressions.

Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although Grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable. Achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Grainger's results to differ materially from those which are presented.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward-looking statement include, without limitation:  higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of source of supply; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; disruption of information technology or data security systems; general industry or market conditions; general global economic conditions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility; commodity price volatility; labor shortages; litigation involving appropriate payment for wages; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and the factors identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger's forward-looking statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.


Item 7A:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Grainger may use financial instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as part of its overall risk management strategy.  The derivative positions reduce risk by hedging certain underlying economic exposures.  Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure.  Grainger does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  See Notes 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Grainger's derivative activities.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

As Grainger's international businesses grow, the greater the effect that foreign currency fluctuations have on the Company's consolidated earnings.  For 2011, a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect Grainger's international subsidiaries would have resulted in a $7.5 million decrease in net earnings. Comparatively, in 2010 a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect Grainger international subsidiaries would have resulted in a $2.7 million decrease in net earnings. A uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $9.2 million increase in net earnings for 2011, as compared with an increase in net earnings of $3.3 million for 2010. This sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs.

Interest Rates

Grainger is subject to interest rate risk related to its variable rate debt portfolio.  Grainger may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage those risks.  Based on the Company's variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding, a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates paid by Grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately $3.0 million for 2011 and $3.1 million for 2010.  A 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately $3.0 million for 2011 and $3.1 million for 2010. This sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on long-term debt does not factor in potential changes in long-term debt levels.

Grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale, but does not purchase commodities directly.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009


MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of W.W. Grainger, Inc. (Grainger) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Grainger's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Grainger's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements under all potential conditions. Therefore, effective internal control over financial reporting provides only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements.

Grainger's management assessed the effectiveness of Grainger's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued  by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (the COSO criteria).  This assessment excluded the internal controls of the Fabory Group acquired on August 31, 2011, which constituted $183 million of net assets at December 31, 2011, and $109 million of revenues for the year then ended. Internal controls of the acquired businesses will be included in the 2012 assessment.  Based on its assessment under that framework and the criteria established therein, Grainger's management concluded that Grainger's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2011

.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited Grainger's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2011

, as stated in their report, which is included herein.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

W.W. Grainger, Inc.

We have audited W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). W.W. Grainger, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management's Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the Fabory Group, which is included in the 2011 consolidated financial statements of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries and constituted $183 million of net assets as of December 31, 2011 and $109 million of revenues for the year then ended.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Fabory Group.

In our opinion, W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.


We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated February 27, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

W.W. Grainger, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2011

. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2011

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2011

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INDUSTRY INFORMATION

W.W. Grainger, Inc. is a broad-line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies, and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions.  In this report, the words “Company” or “Grainger” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.  For investments in which the Company owns or controls from

20%

to

50%

of the voting shares, the equity method of accounting is used. Changes in interest arising from the issuance of stock by an investee are accounted for as additional contributed capital. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

The financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations and related long-term debt are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive earnings. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in the


and


financial statements, as previously reported, have been reclassified to conform to the


presentation.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues recognized include product sales, billings for freight and handling charges and fees earned for services provided. The Company recognizes product sales and billings for freight and handling charges primarily on the date products are shipped to, or picked up by, the customer. The Company's standard shipping terms are FOB shipping point. On occasion, the Company will negotiate FOB destination terms. These sales are recognized upon delivery to the customer. Fee revenues, which account for less than

1%

of total revenues, are recognized after services are completed.

COST OF MERCHANDISE SOLD

Cost of merchandise sold includes product and product-related costs, vendor consideration, freight-out and handling costs. The Company defines handling costs as those costs incurred to fulfill a shipped sales order.

VENDOR CONSIDERATION

The Company receives rebates and allowances from its vendors to promote their products. The Company utilizes numerous advertising programs to promote its vendors' products, including catalogs and other printed media, Internet and other marketing programs. Most of these programs relate to multiple vendors, which makes supporting the specific, identifiable and incremental criteria difficult, and would require numerous assumptions and judgments. Based on the inexact nature of trying to track reimbursements to the exact advertising expenditure for each vendor, the Company treats most vendor advertising allowances as a reduction to Cost of merchandise sold rather than a reduction of operating (advertising) expenses. Rebates earned from vendors that are based on product purchases are capitalized into inventory as part of product purchase price. These rebates are credited to Cost of merchandise sold based on sales. Vendor rebates that are earned based on products sold are credited directly to Cost of merchandise sold.


ADVERTISING

Advertising costs are expensed in the year the related advertisement is first presented. Advertising expense was $

144.6

million, $

122.5 million

and $

114.6 million

for

2011, 2010 and 2009

, respectively. Most vendor-provided allowances are classified as an offset to Cost of merchandise sold. For additional information see VENDOR CONSIDERATION above.

Catalog expense is amortized equally over the life of the catalog, beginning in the month of its distribution. Advertising costs for catalogs that have not been distributed by year-end are capitalized as Prepaid expenses. Amounts included in Prepaid expenses at December 31,

2011 and 2010

, were $

49.5

million and $

45.1 million

, respectively.

WAREHOUSING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Included in this category are purchasing, branch operations, information services, and marketing and selling expenses, as well as other types of general and administrative costs.

STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

The Company measures all share-based payments using fair-value-based methods and records compensation expense related to these payments over the vesting period. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the determination of financial statement income, with deferred taxes being provided for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting.  The Company recognizes in the financial statements a provision for tax uncertainties, resulting from application of complex tax regulations in multiple tax jurisdictions.  See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE EARNINGS (LOSSES)

The Company's Other comprehensive earnings (losses) include foreign currency translation adjustments, changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and unrecognized gains (losses) on postretirement and other employment-related benefit plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CASH

The Company considers investments in highly liquid debt instruments, purchased with an original maturity of ninety days or less, to be cash equivalents.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company places temporary cash investments with institutions of high credit quality and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution.

The Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries doing business in all regions of the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China, Colombia, Panama and Dominican Republic. Consequently, no significant concentration of credit risk is considered to exist.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

The Company establishes reserves for customer accounts that are potentially uncollectible. The method used to estimate the allowances is based on several factors, including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. These analyses also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined primarily by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, which accounts for approximately

65%

of total inventory. For the remaining inventory, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.


PROPERTY, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

Property, buildings and equipment are valued at cost. For financial statement purposes, depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives, principally on the declining-balance and sum-of-the-years-digits depreciation methods. The principal estimated useful lives for determining depreciation are as follows:

Improvements to leased property are amortized over the initial terms of the respective leases or the estimated service lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.

The Company capitalized interest costs of $

0.8

million, $

0.5 million

and $

0.5 million

in

2011, 2010 and 2009

, respectively.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

The carrying value of long-lived assets is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. Impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.

The Company recognized impairment charges of $

8.2

million, $

4.0 million

and $

9.0 million

in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, included in Warehousing, marketing and administrative expenses, to reduce the carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair value pursuant to impairment indicators for property currently held for sale, lease terminations, idle assets and branch closures.

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase of internal-use software.  Amortization of capitalized software is on a straight-line basis over three and five years. Amortization begins when the software is available for its intended use.  Amortization expense was $

19.1

million, $

23.6

million and $

22.7

million for the years ended

December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively

.  Capitalized software was $

43.8 million

and $

33.6 million

at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These costs are included in Other assets and intangibles - net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

Goodwill is recognized as the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.

The Company recognizes an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Such intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless the estimated useful life is determined to be indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives of

one to 22

years. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible, subject to amortization, is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

The Company also maintains intangible assets with indefinite lives, which are not amortized. These intangibles are tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of these assets is less than their carrying value.  See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  The carrying value of long-term debt also approximates fair value due to the variable interest rates.  The fair value of the Company's qualifying derivative instruments is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is discussed in more detail in Note 9.


DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their fair value.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in net earnings or other comprehensive earnings (losses) depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a qualifying hedging relationship.  The ineffective portion of a qualifying hedging derivative and derivatives not designated as a hedge are recognized immediately in earnings.  Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with the change recognized in current period earnings.  See Notes 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's derivative activities.

INSURANCE RESERVES

The Company purchases insurance for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. It also retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers' compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self-insured retentions. Reserves for these potential losses are based on an external analysis of the Company's historical claims results and other actuarial assumptions.

WARRANTY RESERVES

The Company generally warrants the products it sells against defects for one year. For a significant portion of warranty claims, the manufacturer of the product is responsible for expenses. For warranty expenses not covered by the manufacturer, the Company provides a reserve for future costs based primarily on historical experience.  Amounts included in warranty reserves at December 31,

2011 and 2010

, were $

3.1 million

and $

3.2 million

, respectively.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In September 2011, the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This guidance is applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this pronouncement and its adoption did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.


NOTE 2 - BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

On August 31, 2011, the Company acquired

the Fabory Group

, a European distributor of fasteners and related maintenance, repair and operating products.

Fabory is headquartered in Tilburg, the Netherlands, and has more than 100 locations in 15 countries.

In 2010, Fabory had sales of approximately

$300 million

.

The Company paid

$358 million

for  the Fabory acquisition, less cash acquired, and recorded intangibles, including goodwill, of approximately

$257 million

. The purchase price allocation has not been finalized and is subject to change, as the Company obtains additional information during the measurement period related to the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes.

Purchased identified intangible assets totaled approximately $

122 million

.  Acquired intangibles primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names.  Customer relationships ($

80 million

) will be amortized on a straight-line basis over


years. The indefinite-lived intangible ($

42 million

) is related to the Fabory trade name.

During 2010, the Company acquired

four

companies and obtained a majority ownership in one joint venture for approximately $

62 million

, less cash acquired.

During 2009, the Company acquired

three

companies and obtained majority ownership in two joint ventures for approximately $

123 million

, net of cash acquired. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The results of these acquisitions are included in the Company's consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition. Due to the immaterial nature of these transactions, both individually and in the aggregate, disclosures of amounts assigned to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and pro forma results of operations were not considered necessary.


NOTE 3 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill is recognized as the excess cost of an acquired entity over the amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011, are as follows (in thousands of dollars):

The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Grainger tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level.  During the fourth quarter 2011, the Company early adopted FASB's new accounting guidance, which allows companies to assess qualitative factors such as current company performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.  In the two-step goodwill test, the Company compares the carrying value of a reporting unit to its fair value.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the second step is performed, where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value, to determine the amount of impairment.

The Company completed the annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter using the qualitative approach and one reporting unit with the carrying value of goodwill of

$17 million

was determined to be subject to the two-step quantitative impairment testing.  The results of this goodwill impairment test indicated no impairment as of the test date.  However, changes in management's estimates and assumptions can have a significant impact on the fair value of forecasted cash flows and results of future impairment tests.


Intangible assets included in Other assets and intangibles - net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were comprised of the following (in thousands of dollars):

The estimated useful lives for acquired intangibles are as follows:

Amortization expense recognized on intangible assets was $

12.0 million

for 2011, $

11.6 million

for 2010 and $

6.7 million

for 2009, and is included in Warehousing, marketing, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

Estimated amortization expense for future periods is as follows (in thousands of dollars):

NOTE 4 - ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

The following table shows the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands of dollars):


NOTE 5 - INVENTORIES

Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale.  Inventories would have been $

354.5

million and $

336.8 million

higher than reported at

December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively,

if the FIFO method of inventory accounting had been used for all Company inventories. Net earnings would have increased by $

10.9

million, $

2.1 million

and $

10.0 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively

, using the FIFO method of accounting. Inventory values using the FIFO method of accounting approximate replacement cost.  The Company provides reserves for excess and obsolete inventory.  The reserve balance was $

124.7

million and $

112.6 million

as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The increase was due to the Fabory Group acquisition and a higher reserve requirement in Canada.  The reserve decreased in the United States due primarily to a more favorable experience than previously estimated on product added in recent years as part of the product line expansion initiative.

NOTE 6 - INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

In October 2011, Grainger divested its

49%

stake in a joint venture in MRO Korea Co., Ltd. for

$12 million

resulting in   a pretax gain of $

8 million

($

5 million

after-tax) net of the cumulative foreign currency losses reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive earnings.  The Company previously accounted for this investment under the equity method.

In September 2009, the Company acquired

380,000

common shares of MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (MonotaRO) for approximately

$4 million

, increasing its interest from

48%

to

53%

.  The results of MonotaRO are now included in the Company's consolidated results from the date of obtaining a controlling voting interest.  The Company previously accounted for its

48%

interest in MonotaRO as an equity method investment.  Upon obtaining the controlling interest, the previously held equity interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a pretax gain of

$47 million

(

$28 million

after-tax) reported in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The gain includes

$3 million

reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive earnings.

NOTE 7 - SHORT-TERM DEBT

The following summarizes information concerning short-term debt (in thousands of dollars):

Lines of Credit

The Company had $

135.5

million and $

112.3 million

of uncommitted lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Foreign subsidiaries utilize the lines of credit to meet business growth and operating needs.  The maximum month-end balance outstanding during the year was $

69.0 million

and $

42.8 million

for 2011 and 2010, respectively.  The weighted average interest rates were

5.59%

and

4.97%

during 2011 and 2010, respectively.  As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the weighted average interest rates were

5.37%

and

5.26%

, respectively.

The Company had a committed line of credit of $


million in


and


for which the Company paid a commitment fee of

0.10%

in


and


.  This line of credit supports the issuance of commercial paper.  The current line is due to expire in

July 2014

.  There were no borrowings under this committed line of credit.


Commercial Paper

On

July 30, 2010

, the Company issued

$200 million

of commercial paper and proceeds were used to make a partial prepayment of the bank term loan.  The commercial paper had been classified as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at

December 31, 2010

, as the Company had the intent and the ability to maintain it on a long-term basis.  During 2011, the Company repaid

$150 million

of its

$200 million

commercial paper balance and accordingly, the Company reclassified the remaining

$50 million

from long-term debt to short-term debt as of December 31, 2011.  The weighted average interest rate paid during the year was

0.20%

and the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2011 was

0.14%

.

Letters of Credit

The Company had $

26.3

million and $

27.0 million

of letters of credit at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily related to the Company's insurance program.  Letters of credit were also issued to facilitate the purchase of products.  Issued amounts were $

4.1

million and $

4.5 million

at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

NOTE 8 - LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands of dollars):

In May 2008, the Company entered into a $

500 million

, unsecured four-year bank term loan, which matures in

May 2012

.  The weighted average interest rate paid during 2011 was

0.99%

.

In

August 2011

, the Company entered into a

€120 million

, unsecured five-year bank term loan in connection with the acquisition of the Fabory Group, maturing in

August 2016

. The Company, at its option, may prepay this term loan in whole or in part.  Payments of

€2.5 million

are due semi-annually, beginning

February 28, 2013

, with the remaining balance due at maturity.  The weighted average interest rate paid during the year was

2.18%

.  The weighted average interest rate includes inputs from variable rates and a fixed interest rate swap. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The scheduled aggregate principal payments are due as follows (in thousands of dollars):

The Company's debt instruments include only standard affirmative and negative covenants for debt instruments of similar amounts and structure. The Company's debt instruments do not contain financial or performance covenants restrictive to the business of the Company, reflecting its strong financial position. The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants for the year ended

December 31, 2011

.


NOTE 9 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The fair value of significant derivative instruments included in Deferred income taxes, tax uncertainties and derivative instruments was as follows (in thousands of dollars):

The fair values of the these instruments are determined by using quoted market forward rates (level 2 inputs) and reflects the present value of the amount that the Company would pay for contracts involving the same notional amounts and maturity dates.

During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company entered into a pay-fixed / receive-floating interest rate swap with a notional value of

€60 million

maturing in

August 2016

to hedge the future interest expense of the euro denominated  5-year term loan entered into to fund a portion of the Fabory Group acquisition.  The swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge.  The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivative are reported as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses) and reclassified to net income when the hedged transaction affects earnings.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company entered into multiple foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional value of Canadian $

160 million

maturing in

September 2014

.  These forward contracts are designated and qualify as a hedge of an intercompany net investment in the Company's Canadian subsidiary.  The Company uses the forward method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivatives designated as hedging instruments of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and all changes in fair value of the derivatives are reported as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of tax effects, as long as specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

Other foreign currency forward contracts entered into during the current and prior periods to hedge non-functional currency-denominated intercompany note receivables and forecasted U.S. dollar-denominated obligations by foreign subsidiaries of the Company were not material.

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's Accounting Policy regarding derivative instruments and Note 14-Accumulated Other Comprehensive Earnings for additional information.

NOTE 10 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Company provides various retirement benefits to eligible employees, including contributions to defined contribution plans, pension benefits associated with defined benefit plans, postretirement medical benefits and benefits.  Eligibility requirements and benefit levels vary depending on employee location.  Various foreign benefit plans cover employees in accordance with local legal requirements.

Defined Contribution Plans

A majority of the Company's U.S. employees are covered by a noncontributory profit sharing plan.  This plan provides for annual employer contributions based upon a formula related primarily to earnings before federal income taxes, limited to a percentage of the total eligible compensation paid to eligible employees. The annual contribution is limited to a minimum of

8%

and a maximum of

18%

of total eligible compensation paid to eligible employees.  The profit sharing plan expense was $

155.9 million

, $

143.1 million

and $

118.5 million

for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company also sponsors additional defined contribution plans available to certain U.S. and foreign employees for which contributions are paid by the Company and participating employees.  The expense associated with these defined contribution plans totaled $

9.3 million

, $

8.3 million

and $

9.7 million

for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.


Defined Benefit Plans and Other Retirement Plans

The Company sponsors a defined benefit plan which provides pension benefits for certain employees in the Netherlands.  The annual pension benefit is based on

1.75

percent of a career average pay.   The plan is insured and accordingly, all risks with respect to investments, mortality and longevity are covered by an insurance company.  The assets of the plan are invested in a separate account with the insurer.  A December 31 measurement date is utilized to value plan assets and obligations.  Funding of the plan takes place through single premiums for obligations regarding future service years.  As of December 31, 2011, the pension plan is in an overfunded position with a net pension asset of $

12.7 million

.  In 2011, the expense related to this plan was not significant to the Company.

In certain countries pension contributions are made to government-sponsored social security pension plans in accordance with local legal requirements.  For these plans, the Company has no continuing obligations other than the payment of contributions.  The cost of these programs is not significant to the Company.

Executive Death Benefit Plan

The Executive Death Benefit Plan provides one of three potential benefits: a supplemental income benefit (SIB), an executive death benefit (EDB) or a postretirement payment. The SIB provides income continuation at

50%

of total compensation, payable for ten years to the beneficiary of a participant if that participant dies while employed by the Company. The EDB provides an after-tax lump sum payment of one-time final total compensation to the beneficiary of a participant who dies after retirement. In addition, pre-2008 participants may elect to receive a reduced postretirement payment instead of the EDB.  Effective January 1, 2010, the plan is not available to new participants.

The net periodic benefits costs charged to operating expenses were $

1.0 million

, $

1.1 million

and $

1.2 million

in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The net loss recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive earnings (AOCE) was $

0.7 million

as of December 31, 2011.  Net gains recognized in AOCE were $

0.4 million

as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.  The plan benefits are paid as they come due from the general assets of the Company.  The plan benefit obligation was $

17.2 million

and $

15.6 million

as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Postretirement Benefits

The Company has a postretirement healthcare benefits plan that provides coverage for a majority of its United States employees and their dependents should they elect to maintain such coverage upon retirement. Covered employees become eligible for participation when they qualify for retirement while working for the Company. Participation in the plan is voluntary and requires participants to make contributions toward the cost of the plan, as determined by the Company.

The Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and net periodic benefit costs include the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the “Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (the Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a federal subsidy to retiree healthcare benefit plan sponsors that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to that provided by Medicare. As a result of the subsidy, the APBO has been reduced by $

67.6

million, $

52.3 million

and $

43.0 million

as of

December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively

. The subsidy has reduced net periodic benefits costs by approximately $

6.6

million, $

6.3 million

and $

4.7 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively

.

The net periodic benefits costs charged to operating expenses, which were valued with a measurement date of January 1 for each year, consisted of the following components (in thousands of dollars):


The Company has elected to amortize the amount of net unrecognized losses over a period equal to the average remaining service period for active plan participants expected to retire and receive benefits of approximately

16.3

years for


.

Reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances of the APBO, which is calculated using a December 31 measurement date, the fair value of plan assets and the funded status of the benefit obligation follow (in thousands of dollars):

The amounts recognized in AOCE consisted of the following components (in thousands of dollars):

The components of AOCE related to the postretirement benefit costs that will be amortized into net periodic postretirement benefit costs in


are estimated as follows (in thousands of dollars):

The benefit obligation was determined by applying the terms of the plan and actuarial models.  These models include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The actuarial assumptions also anticipate future cost-sharing changes to retiree contributions that will maintain the current cost-sharing ratio between the Company and the retirees. The Company evaluates its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and considers changes in these long-term factors based upon market conditions and historical experience.


The following assumptions were used to determine net periodic benefit costs at January 1:

The following assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:

The discount rate assumptions reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year.  These rates have been selected due to their similarity to the projected cash flows of the postretirement healthcare benefit plan.  As of December 31, 2011, the Company reduced the discount rate from

5.6%

to

4.5%

to reflect the decrease in the market interest rates which contributed to the increase in the unrealized actuarial loss at December 31, 2011.

The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates. Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans. A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects on


results (in thousands of dollars):


The Company has established a Group Benefit Trust (Trust) to fund the plan obligations and process benefit payments.   In December 2010, the Company began to transition the target allocation of the Trust assets from

100%

U.S. equities to

50%

U.S. equities and

50%

non-U.S. equities.  This investment strategy reflects the long-term nature of the plan obligation and seeks to take advantage of the earnings potential of equity securities in the global markets.  The assets of the Trust are invested in funds designed to track to either the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) or the Total International Composite Index.  The Total International Composite Index tracks non-U.S. stocks within developed and emerging market economies.  The plan's assets are stated at fair value which represents the net asset value of shares held by the plan in the registered investment companies at the quoted market prices (Level 1 input) as of December 31 (in thousands of dollars):

The Company uses the long-term historical return on the plan assets and the historical performance of the S&P 500 and, beginning in 2010, the Total International Composite Index to develop its expected return on plan assets.  The required use of an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognition of income that is greater or less than the actual return on plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns and, therefore, result in a pattern of income recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees.

The Company's investment policies include periodic reviews by management and trustees at least annually concerning: (1) the allocation of assets among various asset classes (e.g., domestic stocks, international stocks, short-term bonds, long-term bonds, etc.); (2) the investment performance of the assets, including performance comparisons with appropriate benchmarks; (3) investment guidelines and other matters of investment policy; and (4) the hiring, dismissal, or retention of investment managers.

The funding of the trust is an estimated amount that is intended to allow the maximum deductible contribution under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC), as amended, and was $

7.0

million, $

17.4 million

and $

9.0 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively

. There are no minimum funding requirements and the Company intends to follow its practice of funding the maximum deductible contribution under the IRC.

The Company forecasts the following benefit payments (which include a projection for expected future employee service) and subsidy receipts for the next ten years (in thousands of dollars):


NOTE 11 - LEASES

The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under noncancellable operating leases that expire at various dates through


. There were no significant capital leases at December 31, 2011.  Many of the building leases obligate the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance and certain maintenance costs, and contain multiple renewal provisions, exercisable at the Company's option. Leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rentals are recognized in rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Cash or rent abatements received upon entering into certain operating leases are also recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

At December 31, 2011,

the approximate future minimum lease payments for all operating leases were as follows (in thousands of dollars):

Rent expense, including items under lease and items rented on a month-to-month basis, was $

72.4

million, $

53.4

million and $

45.3

million for

2011, 2010 and 2009

, respectively. These amounts are net of sublease income of $

1.6

million, $

0.9

million and $

0.7

million for

2011, 2010 and 2009

, respectively.


NOTE 12 - STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

The Company maintains stock incentive plans under which the Company may grant a variety of incentive awards to employees and directors. Shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the plans in connection with awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards.

At December 31, 2011,

restricted stock units, performance shares, stock units and non-qualified stock options have been granted.

In 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2010 Incentive Plan (Plan), which replaced all prior active plans (Prior Plans). Awards previously granted under Prior Plans will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.  A total of

5.9 million

shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the Plan.

As of December 31, 2011

, there were

3,405,291

shares available for grant under the Plan.

Pretax stock-based compensation expense was $

50.5

million, $

47.4 million

,  and $

40.7 million

in

2011, 2010 and 2009

, respectively.  Related income tax benefits recognized in earnings were $

17.9

million, $

16.9 million

and $

14.1 million

in

2011, 2010 and 2009

, respectively.

Options

In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company issued stock option grants to employees as part of their incentive compensation. Stock option grants were

520,327

,

689,450

and

763,370

shares for the years

2011, 2010 and 2009

, respectively.

In 2010 and 2009, the Company provided broad-based stock option grants covering

256,000

and

181,100

shares, respectively, to those employees who reached major service milestones and were not participants in other stock option programs.

Option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company's stock on the last trading day preceding the date of grant. The options generally vest over three years, although accelerated vesting is provided in certain circumstances. Awards generally expire ten years from the grant date.

Transactions involving stock options are summarized as follows:

At December 31, 2011,

there was $

15.7 million

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested option awards, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of

1.2

years.


The following table summarizes information about stock options exercised (in thousands of dollars):

Information about stock options outstanding and exercisable as of

December 31, 2011

, is as follows:

The Company uses a binomial lattice option pricing model for the valuation of stock options. The weighted average fair value of options granted in

2011, 2010 and 2009

was $

33.95

, $

24.53

and $

19.32

, respectively. The fair value of each option granted in

2011, 2010 and 2009

used the following assumptions:

The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holder exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of the Company's stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant. Historical company information is also the primary basis for selection of expected dividend yield assumptions.

Performance Shares

The Company awards performance-based shares to certain executives. Receipt of Company stock is contingent upon the Company meeting sales growth and return on invested capital (ROIC) performance goals. Each participant is granted a base number of shares. At the end of the performance period, the number of shares granted will be increased, decreased or remain the same based upon actual Company-wide sales versus target sales. The shares, as determined at the end of the performance period, are issued at the end of the third year if the Company's average target ROIC is achieved during the vesting period.


Performance share value is based upon closing market prices on the last trading day preceding the date of award and is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the three year period based on the number of shares expected to vest.  Holders of performance share awards are not entitled to receive cash payments equivalent to cash dividends.  If the performance shares vest, they will be settled by the issuance of Company common stock in exchange for the performance shares on a one-for-one basis.

The following table summarizes the transactions involving performance-based share awards:

At December 31, 2011,

there was

10.0 million

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to performance-based share awards that the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of

1.7

years.

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

RSUs granted vest over periods from two to seven years from issuance, although accelerated vesting is provided in certain instances. Holders of RSUs are entitled to receive cash payments equivalent to cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to common stock. At various times after vesting, RSUs will be settled by the issuance of stock evidencing the conversion of the RSUs into shares of the Company common stock on a one-for-one basis. Compensation expense related to RSUs is based upon the closing market price on the last trading day preceding the date of award and is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The following table summarizes RSUs activity:

At December 31, 2011,

there was $

55.0 million

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs that the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of

2.1

years.


Director Stock Awards

The Company provides members of the Board of Directors with deferred stock unit grants. A stock unit is the economic equivalent of a share of common stock.  Beginning in April 2010, the number of units covered by each grant is equal to the grant divided by the 200-day average stock price as of January 31

st

in the year of the grant.  Prior to 2010, the number of units covered by each grant was equal to the grant divided by the fair market value of a share of common stock at the time of the grant.  Beginning in April 2011, the Directors were awarded

$115,000

of deferred stock units annually.  Prior to 2011, Directors were awarded

$100,000

of deferred stock units.  The Company also awards stock units in connection with elective deferrals of director fees and dividend equivalents on existing stock units. Deferred fees and dividend equivalents on existing stock units are converted into stock units on the basis of the market value of the stock at the relevant times. Payment of the value of stock units is scheduled to be made after termination of service as a director.  As of

December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009

, there were

The decrease in foreign currency translation adjustments in 2011 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.  The increase in foreign currency translation adjustments in 2010 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Mexican peso.

The increase in unrecognized losses related to the postretirement benefit plan in 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate.  See Note 10 - Employee Benefits.


NOTE 15 - INCOME TAXES

and

NOTE 17 - SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company has two reportable segments:  the United States and Canada.  The United States operating segment reflects the results of Grainger’s U.S. business.  The Canada operating segment reflects the results for Acklands – Grainger Inc., the Company’s Canadian business.  Other businesses include the following significant operations: Fabory Group, MonotaRO, Mexico, China and Colombia. Operating segments generate revenue almost exclusively through the distribution of maintenance, repair and operating supplies, as service revenues account for

less than 1%

of total revenues for each operating segment.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Intersegment transfer prices are established at external selling prices, less costs not incurred due to a related party sale.  The segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to the segments based upon the relative level of service used by each operating segment.


Following is a summary of segment results (in thousands of dollars):


Following are reconciliations of the segment information with the consolidated totals per the financial statements (in thousands of dollars):

Unallocated assets include non-operating cash and cash equivalents, certain prepaid expenses and property, buildings and equipment-net.

Revenues are attributed to countries based on the ship-to location of the customer.

Unallocated expenses and unallocated assets primarily relate to the Company headquarters' support services, which are not part of any business segment, as well as intercompany eliminations. Unallocated expenses include payroll and benefits, depreciation and other costs associated with headquarters-related support services. Unallocated expenses increased due to higher payroll and benefits, and expenses related to mergers and acquisitions activity.


NOTE 18 - SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)

A summary of selected quarterly information for 2011 and 2010 is as follows (in thousands of dollars, except for per share amounts):


NOTE 19 - CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS

Grainger has been named, along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies, as a defendant in litigation in various states involving asbestos and/or silica.  These lawsuits typically assert claims of personal injury arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and/or silica as a consequence of products purportedly distributed by Grainger.  In 2011, Grainger was named in lawsuits relating to asbestos and/or silica involving approximately


new plaintiffs, and lawsuits relating to asbestos and/or silica involving approximately


plaintiffs were dismissed with respect to Grainger, typically based on the lack of product identification.

As of January 11, 2012, Grainger is named in cases filed on behalf of approximately

1,800

plaintiffs in which there is an allegation of exposure to asbestos and/or silica.  Grainger has denied, or intends to deny, the allegations in all of the above-described lawsuits.  If a specific product distributed by Grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits, Grainger would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer.  In addition, Grainger believes that a substantial number of these claims are covered by insurance.  Grainger has entered into agreements with its major insurance carriers relating to the scope, coverage and costs of defense of lawsuits involving claims of exposure to asbestos.  While Grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits, it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Grainger's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Grainger is a party to a contract with the United States General Services Administration (the GSA) first entered into in 1999 and subsequently extended in 2004.  The GSA contract had been the subject of an audit performed by the GSA's Office of the Inspector General.  In December 2007, the Company received a letter from the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Civil Division of the Department of Justice (the DOJ) regarding the GSA contract.  The letter suggested that the Company had not complied with its disclosure obligations and the contract's pricing provisions, and had potentially overcharged government customers under the contract.

Discussions relating to the Company's compliance with its disclosure obligations and the contract's pricing provisions are ongoing. The timing and outcome of these discussions are uncertain and could include settlement or civil litigation by the DOJ to recover, among other amounts, treble damages and penalties under the False Claims Act.  Due to the uncertainties surrounding this matter, an estimate of possible loss cannot be determined.  While this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, an unfavorable resolution could result in significant payments by the Company.  The Company continues to believe that it has complied with the GSA contract in all material respects.

Grainger is a party to a contract with the United States Postal Service (the USPS) entered into in 2003 covering the sale of certain Maintenance Repair and Operating Supplies (the MRO Contract).  The Company received a subpoena dated August 29, 2008, from the USPS Office of Inspector General seeking information about the Company's pricing compliance under the MRO Contract.  The Company has provided responsive information to the USPS and to the DOJ.

Grainger is also a party to a contract with the USPS entered into in 2001 covering the sale of certain janitorial and custodial items (the Custodial Contract). The Company received a subpoena dated June 30, 2009, from the USPS Office of Inspector General seeking information about the Company's pricing practices and compliance under the Custodial Contract.  The Company has provided responsive information to the USPS and to the DOJ.

Discussions with the USPS and DOJ relating to the Company's pricing practices and compliance with the pricing provisions of the MRO Contract and the Custodial Contract are ongoing. The timing and outcome of the USPS and DOJ investigations of the MRO Contract and the Custodial Contract are uncertain and could include settlement or civil litigation by the USPS and DOJ to recover, among other amounts, treble damages and penalties under the False Claims Act.  Due to the uncertainties surrounding these matters, an estimate of possible loss cannot be determined.  While these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, an unfavorable resolution could result in significant payments by the Company.  The Company continues to believe that it has complied with each of the MRO Contract and the Custodial Contract in all material respects.


The Company is conducting an inquiry into alleged falsification of expense accounts submitted by employees in certain sales offices of Grainger China LLC, a subsidiary of the Company.  In the course of the investigation the Company learned that sales employees may have provided prepaid gift cards to certain customers.  The extent and value of the gift cards are subject to further inquiry.  The Company's investigation includes determining whether there were any violations of laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   Consequently, on January 24, 2012, the Company contacted the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to voluntarily disclose that the Company was conducting an internal investigation, and agreed to fully cooperate and update the DOJ and SEC periodically on further developments.

The Company has retained outside counsel to assist in its investigation of this matter.  Because the investigation is on-going, the Company cannot predict at this time whether any regulatory action may be taken or any other potential consequences may result from this matter.

In addition to the foregoing, from time to time the Company is involved in various other legal and administrative proceedings that are incidental to its business, including claims relating to product liability, premises liability, general negligence, environmental issues, employment, intellectual property and other matters. As a government contractor selling to federal, state and local governmental entities, the Company is also subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits or other proceedings, including those related to pricing compliance. It is not expected that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
