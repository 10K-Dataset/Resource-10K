PART I
Item 1: Business

The Company

The registrant, W.W. Grainger, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Illinois
in 1928. It is the leading North American provider of maintenance, repair, and
operating (MRO) supplies, services, and related information to businesses and
institutions. W.W. Grainger, Inc. regards itself as being in the service
business. As used herein, "Company" means W.W. Grainger, Inc. and/or its
subsidiaries as the context may require.

In late 1997, the Company began an organizational restructuring with the
formation of several business operations. Several of these operations were
originally part of the Grainger branch-based business. These changes were made
to create greater focus and accountability in serving the diverse needs of the
Company's customers. 1998 was a transition year in establishing the refocused
organization. Further refinements made in 1999 and in 2000 were in response to
significant initiatives designed to take advantage of the opportunities created
by Internet commerce. FindMRO.com and MROverstocks.com were officially launched
in November 1999. TotalMRO.com opened for business on March 31, 2000. Also in
2000, the Company's OrderZone.com business was combined with Works.com, Inc., a
leading Internet business purchasing service, in a transaction in which the
Company received a 40% interest in the combined entity. In addition, efforts
were made to simplify and better target operations to reinforce quality of
service. As part of this effort, the operations of Grainger Custom Solutions
were combined with those of Grainger Industrial Supply.

The Company offers a breadth of MRO solutions by combining products, services,
and information. It tailors its capabilities with a view toward providing the
lowest total cost MRO solution to select customer groups. The Branch-based
Distribution Businesses primarily serve North American businesses with MRO
purchase needs. The Digital Businesses offer a broad array of MRO supplies,
services, and related information to meet the needs of businesses looking to
reduce process costs through Internet-enabled solutions. Lab Safety Supply
serves customers who choose to purchase safety and other industrial products
through a direct marketing company. The Other Businesses of the Company serve
customers who seek to outsource their MRO supply procurement and management
process.

The Company also has internal business support functions which provide
coordination and guidance in the areas of Accounting, Administrative Services,
Aviation, Business Development, Communications, Compensation and Benefits,
Employee Development, Finance, Government Regulations, Human Resources,
Industrial Relations, Investor Relations, Insurance and Risk Management,
Internal Audit, International Operations, Legal, Planning, Real Estate and
Construction Services, Security and Safety, Taxes, and Treasury services. These
services are provided in varying degrees to all of the business units.

A number of Company-wide capabilities assist business units in serving their
respective markets. These capabilities include technology and information
management, supplier partnerships, supply chain integration skills, and an
understanding of the customers' MRO environments.

The Company does not engage in basic or substantive product research and
development activities. New items are added regularly to the Company's product
lines on the basis of market information, recommendations of its employees,
customers, and suppliers, and other factors. The Company's research and
development efforts are focused on new methods of serving customers.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

The Company's Branch-based Distribution Businesses provide customers with
solutions to their immediate and/or planned MRO purchase needs throughout North
America. Logistics networks are configured for rapid availability. A broad
selection of MRO products is offered at local branches through user-friendly
catalogs and via the Internet. The Branch-based Distribution Businesses consist
of Grainger Industrial Supply, Grainger.com, Acklands-Grainger Inc. (Canada),
Grainger Export, Grainger Global Sourcing, Grainger Parts, Grainger, S.A. de
C.V. (Mexico), and Puerto Rico. Described below are the more significant of
these businesses.

Grainger Industrial Supply
- --------------------------
The focus of Grainger Industrial Supply is to provide the best combination of
product selection, local availability, speed of delivery, and simplicity of
ordering at a competitive price to United States businesses and institutions of
all sizes. Its primary customers are small and medium-sized companies. It also
addresses large-sized organizations' MRO needs.

Grainger Industrial Supply operates 382 branches in all 50 states. These
branches are located within minutes of the majority of U.S. businesses and carry
inventory to support their local market needs. Products are available for
immediate pick up, same-day shipment, or delivery.




On average, a branch has 14 employees and handles about 230 transactions per
day. During 2000, an average of approximately 90,000 sales transactions were
completed daily. In 1999, Grainger Industrial Supply began adding new, smaller
"storefront" branches to fulfill will-call needs and customer service as more
shipping was moved from the branches to distribution centers. In addition,
Grainger Industrial Supply has eight "master branches" which range in size from
20,000 square feet to 100,000 square feet and stock the fastest selling 30,000
items. In 2000, Grainger Industrial Supply invested more than $5,000,000 in new
branches, branch relocations, and branch additions. During the year, 13 new
branches were opened, three were relocated, two closed, and a number of
remodeling projects were completed.

Grainger Industrial Supply has six Zone Distribution Centers (ZDCs) in
operation. ZDCs ship orders directly to customers for all branches located in
their zone, including Internet orders. Two Regional Distribution Centers located
in Greenville County, South Carolina, and Kansas City, Missouri, provide the
branches with product. A National Distribution Center is a centralized storage
and shipping facility serving customers and the entire network with slower
moving inventory items.

In 2000, Grainger Industrial Supply began a multi-year redesign and expansion of
its distribution network that will allow the Company to remove the costs of a
warehousing step from the current distribution system. This redesign is not only
intended to reduce costs but also to increase capacity. As part of the redesign,
Grainger Industrial Supply is transitioning its existing zone and regional
warehouses into more highly automated distribution centers. The project includes
the relocation and expansion of some of the existing ZDCs and the building of
two new facilities. When the transition is complete, the distribution centers
will average more than 300,000 square feet in size, employ state-of-the-art
equipment and processes, and stock 50,000 of the fastest selling items.

Grainger Industrial Supply sells principally to service shops, industrial and
commercial maintenance departments, manufacturers, hotels, government,
contractors, and health care and educational facilities. Sales transactions
during 2000 were made to approximately 1,400,000 customers. It is estimated that
approximately 28% of 2000 sales consisted of items bearing the Company's
registered trademarks, including DAYTON(R) (principally electric motors, heating
and ventilation equipment), TEEL(R) (liquid pumps), SPEEDAIRE(R) (air
compressors), AIR HANDLER(R) (air filtration equipment), DEM-KOTE(R) (spray
paints), WESTWARD(R) (hand and power tools), and LUMAPRO(R) (task and outdoor
lighting), as well as other of the Company's trademarks. The Company has taken
steps to protect these trademarks against infringement and believes that they
will remain available for future use in its business. Sales of remaining items
generally consisted of products carrying the names of other well recognized
brands.

The Grainger Industrial Supply catalog offers almost 100,000 MRO products from
more than 1,000 suppliers, most of whom are manufacturers. Approximately 2.0
million copies of the catalog were distributed in 2000. The most current edition
was issued in January 2001. The largest supplier in 2000, a diversified
manufacturer through 18 of its divisions, accounted for about 10% of Grainger
Industrial Supply's purchases. No significant difficulty has been encountered
with respect to sources of supply.

The Grainger Industrial Supply CD-ROM catalog is designed to bring directly to
the customer's place of business a fast, easy way to select products. Through
the CD-ROM catalog, the customer can use a variety of ways to describe a needed
product, and then review Grainger Industrial Supply's offerings, complete with
specifications, prices, and pictures. Another CD-ROM catalog feature includes a
cross-reference function that allows customers to retrieve product information
using their own stock numbers. More than 1.4 million copies of the CD-ROM
catalog were distributed in 2000. The CD-ROM catalog is also used at the
branches as a training tool and resource for identifying appropriate products
for customers' applications.

Grainger.com
- ------------
The Grainger.com site was one of the first MRO websites. This website is an
"e-storefront" or "point of access" into the Grainger Industrial Supply
business. Grainger.com, however, offers more products than the Grainger
Industrial Supply catalog, as well as automated search and customer
personalization. It also is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week
providing real-time availability, customer-specific pricing, search engines, and
a number of other enhancements. For large customers interested in connecting to
Grainger.com using sophisticated purchasing platforms, Grainger has introduced a
universal connection. This technology translates the different languages used by
electronic marketplaces, exchanges, and enterprise software vendor (ESV) systems
and allows information from these systems to be fed directly into Grainger
Industrial Supply's operating platform.

The Company continued to integrate the Grainger.com site as a prominent service
channel for its branch-based businesses. Customers have access to a much larger
selection of MRO products through Grainger.com, which has more than 220,000
products available. The Company has found that customers that order online
increase their purchases through all Company channels at more than double the
expected rate of growth. Orders processed through Grainger.com resulted in sales
of approximately $267,000,000 in 2000, $101,000,000 in 1999, and $13,500,000 in
1998. Based on year-end volumes, the Company estimated that the annualized run
rate for orders processed through Grainger.com was more than $300,000,000.


Acklands-Grainger Inc. (AGI)
- ----------------------------
AGI, acquired in December 1996, is Canada's leading branch-based broad-line MRO
distributor. It serves customers through 186 branches and 6 distribution centers
across Canada. AGI distributes tools, lighting, HVAC, safety supplies,
pneumatics, instruments, welding equipment and supplies, motors, and shop
equipment, as well as many other items. A comprehensive catalog, printed in both
English and French, is used to showcase the product line and to help customers
select products. This catalog, with over 70,000 products listed, supports the
efforts of 275 sales representatives throughout Canada. During 2000, an average
of approximately 20,000 sales transactions were completed daily.

Grainger Global Sourcing
- ------------------------
Grainger Global Sourcing procures competitively priced, high-quality products
produced outside the United States. These items are sold primarily under private
label by Grainger Industrial Supply and the Company's other businesses. Products
obtained through Grainger Global Sourcing in 2000 include WESTWARD(R) tools and
LUMAPRO(R) lighting products, as well as products bearing other trademarks.

Grainger Parts
- --------------
Grainger Parts provides access to over 330,000 parts and accessories through its
centralized warehouse located in Northbrook, Illinois. Trained representatives
have access to more than 250,000 pages of detailed parts diagrams online.
Grainger Parts handled about 1,600,000 customer calls in 2000 through its call
centers in Northbrook, Illinois, and Waterloo, Iowa.

Grainger Parts has been ISO 9002 certified since 1995. Grainger Parts' 100%
compliance with ISO 9002 standards ranked it among the top 10% of all
ISO-certified companies.

Grainger, S.A. de C.V.
- ----------------------
Grainger, S.A. de C.V. serves the MRO product needs of customers in Mexico. The
business employed 87 sales representatives at December 31, 2000. From its 80,000
square foot facility outside Monterrey, the business provides delivery of over
80,000 products throughout Mexico. A new branch was opened in 2000 in
Guadalajara.

Digital Businesses

The Digital Businesses represent a suite of e-commerce offerings designed to
meet the needs of businesses looking to reduce cost and increase the
effectiveness of their MRO/indirect materials process through Internet-enabled
solutions. The Digital Businesses consist of FindMRO.com, TotalMRO.com, and
MROverstocks.com (originally named Grainger Auction). OrderZone.com, the
indirect materials marketplace that was launched in 1999, was combined with
Works.com, a leading Internet business purchasing service, in August 2000. The
Company received a 40% interest in the combined entity.

FindMRO.com
- ------------
FindMRO.com is an Internet-based sourcing center for indirect material spot
buys. Introduced in November 1999, FindMRO.com accesses a database of more than
14,000 suppliers and 5,000,000 products. Through the convenience of the
Internet, sophisticated search technologies, and sourcing expertise of its
sourcing professionals, FindMRO.com offers to address the time-consuming problem
of finding products when a source is unknown to the buyer. From frequent to
hard-to-find or from daily to one-time purchases, FindMRO.com is designed to
meet a number of customer needs, including product search, product sourcing,
supplier management, order processing, order fulfillment, technical support
facilitation, and logistics management.

MROverstocks.com
- -----------------
Introduced in November 1999, MROverstocks.com offers online inventory
liquidation services through real-time bidding. MROverstocks.com provides an
outlet to move discontinued inventory (undamaged products that are not the
latest versions) or excess inventory. Initially, the site exclusively handled
discontinued inventory from Grainger Industrial Supply. Customer response was
such that MROverstocks.com was established as a separate business unit in early
2000 and is now open to Company suppliers, additional Company businesses, and
others.

TotalMRO.com
- ------------
Introduced in March 2000, TotalMRO.com provides customers with access to a
single, networked catalog containing easily searchable, detailed product
information, prenegotiated prices, and availability information for MRO products
and services from major MRO distributors.

On January 26, 2001, the Company announced the consolidation of the above three
digital businesses, along with three other related service units, into a
separate organization, Material Logic. The new organization is seeking
participation from MRO distributors to create an industry-backed,
industry-funded independent entity that will own and operate those businesses.
The new organization, in which the Company plans to hold a minority position,
plans to work with large national MRO distributors to create a broad digital
solution providing customers access to substantial cost benefits through
e-commerce platforms, e-marketplaces, and hosted ASP solutions.


Lab Safety Supply, Inc.

Lab Safety Supply is a direct marketer of safety and other industrial products
to U.S. and Canadian businesses. Located in Janesville, Wisconsin, Lab Safety
Supply primarily reaches its customers through its General Catalog, targeted
catalogs, and other marketing materials, which are distributed throughout the
year.

Lab Safety Supply offers extensive product depth, technical support, and high
service levels. It is a primary safety supplier for many small and medium-sized
companies and a critical backup supplier for many larger companies. Customers
have access to over 70,000 products in Lab Safety Supply's General Catalog. In
addition, customers can access products using a new CD-ROM version of the
catalog or online via the web at LabSafety.com.

Other Businesses

Other Businesses of the Company include a number of businesses, the largest
being Grainger Integrated Supply.

Grainger Integrated Supply
- --------------------------
Grainger Integrated Supply serves customers who have chosen to outsource
components or all of their indirect materials management process. The service
offering is designed to enable customers to focus on their core business
objectives.

Grainger Integrated Supply offers a full complement of on-site outsourcing
solutions, including business process reengineering, inventory management,
supply chain management, tool crib management, and information management.
Grainger Integrated Supply provides its clients with access to more than
5,000,000 products through its relationships with respected manufacturers,
service providers, Grainger Industrial Supply, and other distributors.

Industry Segments

As a result of meeting certain reporting thresholds in 2000, Lab Safety Supply
is being reported as a separate segment for all years presented. Lab Safety
Supply had previously been grouped with Other Businesses. This new reporting is
not reflective of any management or organizational change. For 2000 the Company
is reporting three industry segments: Branch-based Distribution, Digital, and
Lab Safety Supply. For segment information and the Company's consolidated
revenue and operating earnings see "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations," and "Item 8: Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data." The total assets of the Company for the last
five years were: 2000, $2,459,601,000; 1999, $2,564,826,000; 1998,
$2,103,966,000; 1997, $2,000,116,000; and 1996, $2,119,021,000.

Competition

The Company faces competition in all the markets it serves, from manufacturers
(including some of the Company's own suppliers) that sell directly to certain
segments of the market, from wholesale distributors, from catalog houses, from
certain Internet-based businesses and product fulfillment mechanisms, and from
certain retail enterprises.

The principal means by which the Company competes with manufacturers and other
distributors is by local stock availability, efficient service, account
managers, competitive pricing, its several catalogs, which include product
descriptions and in certain cases, extensive technical and application data,
procurement process consulting services, electronic and Internet commerce
technology, and other efforts to assist customers in lowering their total MRO
costs. The Company believes that it can effectively compete on a price basis
with its manufacturing competitors on small orders, but that such manufacturers
may enjoy a cost advantage in filling large orders.

The Company serves a number of diverse markets and is able in some markets to
reasonably estimate the Company's competitive position within that market.
However, taken as a whole, the Company is unable to determine its market share
relative to others engaged in whole or in part in similar activities.

Employees

As of December 31, 2000, the Company had 16,192 employees, of whom 13,855 were
full-time and 2,337 were part-time or temporary. The Company has never had a
major work stoppage and considers its employee relations generally to be good.

Item 2: Properties

As of December 31, 2000, the Company's owned and leased facilities totaled
17,629,000 square feet, about the same as in 1999. Grainger Industrial Supply
and Acklands-Grainger Inc. (AGI) accounted for the majority of the total square
footage. Grainger Industrial Supply facilities are located throughout the United
States. AGI facilities are located throughout Canada.

Grainger Industrial Supply branches range in size from 1,200 to 109,000 square
feet and average 20,000 square feet. Most are located in or near major

Company Net Sales -- 2000 Compared to 1999
- ------------------------------------------
The Company's net sales of $4,977,044,000 for 2000 increased 7.4% from net sales
of $4,636,275,000 for 1999. This increase resulted from a 6.5% increase in the
Branch-based Distribution Businesses segment, a 1,769.2% increase in the Digital
Businesses segment, a 5.3% increase at Lab Safety Supply, and a 43.7% increase
in the Other Businesses of the Company. The year 2000 had one more sales day
than did 1999 (255 versus 254). On a daily basis the Company's net sales
increased 6.9%.

Sales growth for 2000 was primarily volume driven, reflecting growth in the
Branch-based Businesses, especially in Canada and Mexico; strong growth at
Grainger Integrated Supply; and continued strong growth in sales processed
through the Company's Internet sites.

Sales processed through the Company's Internet businesses, as represented by the
Digital segment plus Grainger.com, amounted to $337,000,000 in 2000, a 230%
increase as compared with $102,000,000 for the year 1999.

The Company's sales growth during the fourth quarter of 2000 was negatively
affected by a slowing economy.

Segment Net Sales

The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment
net sales; those comments at the business unit level include external and inter-
and intrasegment net sales. For segment information see Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

Net sales at the Branch-based Distribution Businesses amounted to $4,483,777,000
in 2000, a 6.5% increase over 1999 sales of $4,211,316,000. Average daily sales
increased by 6.1%.

Acklands-Grainger Inc. experienced double-digit sales growth. The growth was the
result of strong sales across most of Canada. The growth was driven by an
improvement in the oil and gas, forestry, and mining sectors of the Canadian
economy, gains in large customer accounts, and the opening of 10 new branches
during 1999.

Grainger, S.A. de C.V. experienced double-digit sales growth reflecting the
continued development of this business. This growth in sales was attributable to
an expanded product offering and account penetration. In January 2000, the
Company opened a second branch in Mexico.

Sales growth in the United States was driven by improved sales at Grainger
Industrial Supply. Contributing to the sales growth were 35 new branches opened
during 1999 and 2000. Also contributing to the sales growth was increased sales
to government accounts.

Sales were also favorably affected by continued momentum in the Company's
Internet initiative. Sales orders processed through Grainger.com amounted to
$267,000,000 in 2000, a 164% increase over 1999 sales of $101,000,000.

Partially offsetting this growth was the impact of a 20% decline in third
quarter sales of seasonal products resulting from relatively mild weather in the
more heavily populated areas of the United States. Also, sales growth during the
fourth quarter of 2000 was negatively affected by a slowing economy.



Digital Businesses

Net sales at the Digital Businesses amounted to $55,683,000 in 2000, a
significant increase over 1999 sales of $2,979,000. Sales for this group of
businesses include product sales and service fee revenues for FindMRO.com and
service fee revenues for MROverstocks.com (formerly Grainger Auction) and
TotalMRO.com. FindMRO.com and MROverstocks.com were officially launched in
November 1999; TotalMRO.com opened for business on March 31, 2000.

Lab Safety Supply

Net sales at Lab Safety Supply amounted to $330,108,000, a 5.3% increase
over 1999 sales of $313,533,000. This increase reflects the continued growth in
sales of industrial products and expanded market share attained through new
customers and further penetration of existing accounts. Partially offsetting
this increase was a decline in sales of safety products resulting from a slowing
of the industrial economy in the United States.

Other Businesses

Net sales at the Other Businesses amounted to $180,852,000 in 2000, a 43.7%
increase over 1999 sales of $125,882,000.

Sales growth for this segment was primarily related to a strong sales increase
at Grainger Integrated Supply. Sales for this business unit include product
sales and management fees. Growth was driven by new engagements, contract
renewals, and scope expansions, reflecting increasing demand for this
outsourcing business, which provides fee-based, on-site indirect materials
management services to large businesses.

Company Net Sales -- 1999 Compared to 1998
- ------------------------------------------
The Company's net sales of $4,636,275,000 for 1999 increased 4.4% from net sales
of $4,438,975,000 for 1998. This increase resulted from a 3.2% increase in the
Branch-based Distribution Businesses segment, a 499.4% increase in the Digital
Businesses segment, an 8.7% increase at Lab Safety Supply, and a 45.8% increase
in the Other Businesses of the Company. Since 1999 had one fewer sales day than
did 1998 (254 versus 255), the Company's net sales increased 4.9% on a daily
basis.

Despite a soft industrial economy in the United States, sales growth was
positive in 1999 versus 1998. Sales growth for the year 1999 was primarily
volume driven, reflecting the favorable effects from new marketing initiatives
and the continuing acceleration in Internet transactions. Sales growth was
constrained, however, by customer service issues at Grainger Industrial Supply
and Grainger Parts related to the field rollout of the new enterprise resource
planning (ERP) system. A total of $20,000,000 of sales are estimated to have
been lost as a result of these service issues.

Segment Net Sales

The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment
net sales; those comments at the business unit level include external and inter-
and intrasegment net sales. For segment information see Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

Net sales at the Branch-based Distribution Businesses amounted to $4,211,316,000
in 1999, a 3.2% increase over 1998 sales of $4,079,415,000. Average daily sales
increased by 3.6%.

Grainger Industrial Supply -- Average daily sales increased 3% in 1999 as
compared with 1998. Contributing to the 1999 sales growth were the addition of
22 new branches opened during the year and increased sales to large customers.
Sales were negatively affected by approximately $18,400,000 as a result of the
customer service issues discussed above. Sales prices decreased 0.7% in 1999
versus 1998.

This business also realized incremental sales of $15,300,000 during the 1999
fourth quarter, including $7,100,000 in December 1999, related to customer
concerns about Y2K. Products affected included generators, flashlights, and
batteries.

Sales were favorably affected by continued momentum in the Company's Internet
strategy. Orders for sales processed through Grainger.com in 1999 were
approximately $101,000,000.

Acklands-Grainger Inc. (Canada) -- Average daily sales increased 6% in 1999 as
compared with 1998. This increase was driven by growth in both Eastern and
Western Canada. The growth in Eastern Canada was primarily attributable to the
addition of 16 net new branches during 1999 and 1998. The growth in Western
Canada was driven by an improvement in the oil and gas, forestry, and industrial
sectors of the economy, along with gains in sales to large customers, including
government agencies. In Canadian dollars, average daily sales increased 7%.

Grainger, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico) -- Average daily sales increased 16% in 1999 as
compared with 1998. This sales growth reflects the continuing planned
development of this new business. A key driver was increased sales to customers
located in Mexico's interior that are served by the Company's facility in
Monterrey.

Grainger Custom Solutions (combined with Grainger Industrial Supply for 2000) --
Average daily sales decreased 2% in 1999 as compared with 1998. The focus of
this business in 1999 was transitioning large, complex customers to the new
business platform, while pursuing rationalization of facilities and other
synergies with Grainger Industrial Supply.


Digital Businesses

Net sales at the Digital Businesses amounted to $2,979,000 in 1999, a 499.4%
increase over 1998 sales of $497,000. These sales included product sales and
service fee revenues for FindMRO.com and service fee revenues for OrderZone.com.
Both businesses were officially launched in 1999. Revenue recorded in 1998
represents intracompany sales for FindMRO.com.

Lab Safety Supply

Net sales at Lab Safety Supply amounted to $313,533,000 in 1999, an 8.7%
increase over 1998 sales of $288,491,000. This sales growth was largely
attributable to Lab Safety Supply's product line expansion program.

Other Businesses

Net sales at the Other Businesses amounted to $125,882,000 in 1999, a 45.8%
increase over 1998 sales of $86,358,000. Sales growth for this segment was
primarily related to a strong sales increase at Grainger Integrated Supply.
Sales for this business unit included product throughput and management fees.
Growth was driven by new engagements, contract renewals, and scope expansions,
reflecting increasing demand for this outsourcing business, which provides
fee-based, on-site indirect materials management services to large businesses.

Company Net Earnings -- 2000 Compared to 1999
- ---------------------------------------------

The Company's net earnings of $192,903,000 for 2000 increased 6.7% as compared
with 1999 net earnings of $180,731,000. This increase resulted from higher
operating earnings and lower other deductions, partially offset by a higher
effective income tax rate.

Operating earnings improved at the Branch-based Distribution Businesses and at
Lab Safety Supply. Also, the operating losses at the Other Businesses decreased.
These improvements were partially offset by the increased operating losses at
the Digital Businesses.

Segment Operating Earnings

The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment
operating earnings; those comments at the business unit level include external
and inter- and intrasegment operating earnings. For segment information see Note
17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

Operating earnings at the Branch-based Distribution Businesses amounted to
$397,252,000 in 2000, an 11.0% increase over 1999 operating earnings of
$357,925,000. This improvement in operating earnings was greater than the sales
increase because operating expenses grew at a slower rate than the growth in
sales, partially offset by lower gross profit margins.

Operating expenses increased 2%, primarily the result of productivity
improvements. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher data
processing expenses (including increased depreciation, amortization, and systems
maintenance costs) and increased bad debt provisions.

Gross profit margins decreased 0.67 percentage point as compared to 1999. Of
note are the following factors affecting the gross profit margin:

1.    Grainger Industrial Supply's gross profit margin declined. This decline
      was primarily due to an unfavorable change in selling price category mix
      resulting from increased sales of sourced products and to higher freight
      costs. The above factors were partially offset by selected price increases
      during the 2000 third quarter. The price increases were intended to
      recover freight and supplier cost increases.

2.    Acklands-Grainger Inc. had a lower gross profit margin primarily due to an
      unfavorable change in selling price category mix as a result of increased
      sales to large customers.

Digital Businesses

The Digital Businesses incurred operating losses of $48,207,000 in 2000 compared
with operating losses of $20,560,000 in 1999. During 2000 the Company continued
to invest in developing, enhancing, operating, and marketing these digital
businesses.

Total operating expenses associated with the Company's Internet initiatives, as
represented by this segment plus Grainger.com (which is included in the
Branch-based Distribution Businesses segment), were $108,000,000 in 2000 as
compared with $42,000,000 in 1999.

On August 1, 2000, the Company combined OrderZone.com with Works.com, a leading
Internet purchasing service. This combination is designed to provide small and
mid-size businesses with online purchasing services for indirect business
products. The Company received a 40% interest in the combined entity and
recognizes a proportionate share of earnings or losses as part of Other
Deductions.


On January 26, 2001, the Company announced the consolidation of FindMRO.com,
MROverstocks.com, and TotalMRO.com into a separate organization, Material Logic.
Participation is being sought from MRO distributors to establish Material Logic
as an industry-backed, industry-funded independent entity that will own and
operate these businesses. Material Logic is also expected to include related
consulting, implementation, and content services. Working with large national
MRO distributors, Material Logic will seek to create a broad digital solution
providing customers access to substantial cost benefits through e-commerce
platforms, e-marketplaces, and hosted ASP solutions.

Lab Safety Supply

Operating earnings at Lab Safety Supply amounted to $55,037,000 in 2000, a 28.4%
increase over 1999 operating earnings of $42,878,000. This increase resulted
from improved operating performance and the elimination of expenses related to
certain fully amortized intangibles.

Other Businesses

The Other Businesses of the Company incurred operating losses of $13,257,000 in
2000 compared with operating losses of $16,306,000 in 1999. The lower operating
losses for this group of companies was a function of improved performance at all
of the businesses grouped under this caption, including Grainger Integrated
Supply.

Other Income Statement Data

Interest expense of $24,403,000 for 2000 increased by $8,807,000 as compared
with 1999. This increase resulted from higher average borrowings, higher average
interest rates paid on all outstanding debt, and lower capitalized interest.

The equity in losses of unconsolidated entities (after tax) primarily related to
the Company's interest in Works.com, which was acquired during the 2000 third
quarter.

Unclassified--net income for 2000 was $29,842,000 versus $512,000 for 1999. The
year 2000 included a $30,017,000 gain from the sales of investment securities.

The Company's effective income tax rate was 41.8% for 2000 and 40.5% for 1999.
The increase in the effective income tax rate relates to the loss on equity
interest in unconsolidated entities, which is a net of tax number. Excluding the
effect of these joint venture losses, the effective income tax rate was 40.5%
for both years.

Company Net Earnings -- 1999 Compared to 1998
- ---------------------------------------------
The Company's net earnings of $180,731,000 for 1999 decreased 24.2% compared
with 1998 net earnings of $238,504,000. This decline resulted from lower
operating earnings and higher other deductions. Operating earnings declined at
the Branch-based Distribution Businesses and the loss at the Digital Businesses
increased. Operating earnings improved at Lab Safety Supply and the operating
losses at the Other Businesses declined.

The Company's Branch-based Distribution Businesses were affected by
system-related customer service issues. It is estimated that these service
issues cost the Company $32,000,000 in operating earnings in 1999, comprised of
gross profit on lost sales, higher freight-out expenses driven by increased
shipments qualifying for prepaid freight and the use of premium freight to meet
service objectives, and incremental operating expenses. Also affecting
performance were the continuing investments incurred to launch, enhance, and
market the Company's Internet-related businesses.

Segment Operating Earnings

The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment
operating earnings; those comments at the business unit level include external
and inter- and intrasegment operating earnings.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

Operating earnings of $357,925,000 declined 18% in 1999 as compared with
$435,891,000 for 1998. Operating earnings performance was affected by lower than
expected sales growth, largely due to weakness in the North American industrial
economy and to system-related customer service issues at Grainger Industrial
Supply and Grainger Parts, as previously described. Also contributing to the
decline were lower gross profit margins and higher operating expenses. Of note
are the following factors that affected the gross profit margin:

1.    Grainger Industrial Supply's gross profit margin declined. Contributing to
      the decline were higher freight-out expenses driven by increased shipments
      qualifying for prepaid freight and the use of premium freight to meet
      service objectives.
2.    Acklands-Grainger Inc. had a lower gross profit margin primarily due to an
      unfavorable change in selling price category mix as a result of increased
      sales to large customers.
3.    The gross profit margin at Grainger Custom Solutions improved.
4.    Sales at Grainger Custom Solutions declined, which had a positive effect
      on the Company's gross profit margin since Grainger Custom Solutions'
      gross profit margin was lower than the Company's average gross profit
      margin.


Operating expenses increased about 9% in 1999 versus 1998. This rate of growth
exceeded the rate of growth in net sales due to:

1.    Increased expenses related to the development of the business in Mexico;
2.    Increased occupancy expenses;
3.    Increased data processing expenses related to the installation of Grainger
      Industrial Supply's new ERP system;
4.    Increased expenses incurred to maintain customer service levels during the
      installation of the new ERP system;
5.    Continued spending to develop and market Grainger.com (Grainger.com
      spending in 1999 was $18,100,000 compared with $6,700,000 in 1998.);
6.    Increased expenses related to the opening of eight new branches in Canada
      and 22 new branches in the United States; and
7.    Increased infrastructure expenses relating to developing the Grainger
      Custom Solutions business.

The above factors were partially offset by decreased advertising expenses at
Grainger Industrial Supply resulting from increased cooperative programs.

Digital Businesses

The Digital Businesses incurred operating losses of $20,560,000 in 1999 compared
with operating losses of $8,091,000 in 1998. During 1999 the Company continued
to invest in the development of these businesses. The Digital Businesses
incurred operating expenses of $23,500,000 in 1999 versus $8,600,000 in 1998 for
developing, enhancing, and marketing OrderZone.com and FindMRO.com.

Lab Safety Supply

Operating earnings of $42,878,000 increased 9.0% in 1999 as compared with
$39,330,000 for 1998. The growth in operating earnings was in line with the
growth in net sales.

Other Businesses

The Other Businesses incurred operating losses of $16,306,000 in 1999 compared
with operating losses of $20,822,000 in 1998. This improvement was primarily
attributable to improved operating results at Grainger Integrated Supply. Of
note were the following:

1.    The gross profit margin decreased at Grainger Integrated Supply. This
      decrease related to product sales throughput, which grew at a faster rate
      than the related management fee income.
2.    Operating expenses at Grainger Integrated Supply decreased from 1998
      levels while average daily sales increased 48%.

Other Income Statement Data

Interest expense increased by $8,944,000 in 1999 as compared with 1998. This
increase resulted from higher average borrowings and higher average interest
rates paid on all outstanding debt, partially offset by higher capitalized
interest.

Unclassified--net had a positive effect on earnings before income taxes of
$2,555,000 in 1999 as compared with 1998. In 1999, the Company recorded a gain
related to the disposal of facilities in the Chicagoland area. The expenses in
1998 were primarily the result of foreign currency translation losses relating
to the Company's operations in Mexico and a write-off of abandoned capital
projects.

The Company's effective income tax rate was 40.5% in both 1999 and 1998.

                               FINANCIAL CONDITION

Working capital was $735,678,000 at December 31, 2000, compared with
$600,611,000 at December 31, 1999, and $541,872,000 at December 31, 1998. The
ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.0, 1.7, and 1.8 at such
dates.

Net cash flows from operations of $277,757,000 in 2000, $37,240,000 in 1999, and
$331,481,000 in 1998, have continued to improve the Company's financial position
and serve as the primary source of funding for capital requirements. For
information as to the Company's cash flows, see "Item 8: Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data."

In each of the past three years, a portion of working capital has been used for
additions to property, buildings, equipment, and capitalized software as
summarized in the following table.

The Company repurchased 37,840 shares of its common stock during 2000, 355,300
shares of its common stock during 1999, and 4,483,100 shares of its common stock
during 1998. As of December 31, 2000, approximately 5,300,000 shares of common
stock remained available under repurchase authorization.

Dividends paid to shareholders were $62,863,000 in 2000, $58,817,000 in 1999,
and $56,683,000 in 1998.

Internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and
funds needed for expanding the business, supplemented by debt as circumstances
dictated. In addition to continuing facilities optimization efforts, business
development, and systems and other infrastructure enhancements, funds are being
expended to develop and enhance the Company's Internet initiatives.

The Company maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides
flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In
addition to internally generated funds, the Company has various sources of
financing available, including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under
lines of credit and otherwise. Total debt as a percent of Shareholders' Equity
was 21%, 30%, and 18% at December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

                          INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on
operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of
accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial
reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the
effects of inflation in the primary financial statements.

The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap
between historic cost and replacement cost continues to be significant for these
long-lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets
increases significantly when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation.

The Company believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the
interests of investors lies in continued application of basic business
principles, which include improving productivity, increasing working capital
turnover, and offering products and services which can command appropriate price
levels in the marketplace.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

Shareholders and Board of Directors
W.W. Grainger, Inc.

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of W.W.
Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of W.W. Grainger,
Inc., and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

   We have also audited Schedule II of W.W. Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries
for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998. In our opinion, this
Schedule presents fairly, in all material respects, the information required to
be set forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INDUSTRY INFORMATION
The Company is engaged in the distribution of maintenance, repair, and operating
(MRO) supplies, services, and related information to businesses and institutions
in North America.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from
the consolidated financial statements.

INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES
Investments in 20% to 50% owned affiliates are accounted for using the equity
method.

RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts in the 1999 and 1998 financial statements, as previously
reported, have been reclassified to conform to the 2000 presentation.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues
and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are generally
measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Net exchange gains
or losses resulting from the translation of financial statements of foreign
operations, and related long-term debt, except for those from highly
inflationary economies, are recorded as a separate component of shareholders'
equity.

INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
primarily by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

PROPERTY, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT
Property, buildings, and equipment are valued at cost.

For financial statement purposes, depreciation and amortization are provided in
amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over
their estimated service lives, principally on the declining-balance and
sum-of-the-years-digits methods. The principal estimated useful lives used in
determining depreciation are as follows:

Buildings, structures, and improvements..............             10 to 45 years
Furniture, fixtures, machinery, and equipment........              3 to 10 years

Improvements to leased property are amortized over the initial terms of the
respective leases or the estimated service lives of the improvements, whichever
is shorter.

The Company capitalized interest costs of $747,000, $3,238,000, and $2,323,000,
in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the
fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the
asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues recognized include product sales, billings for freight and handling
charges, and fees earned for services provided. The Company recognizes product
sales and billings for freight and handling charges on the date products are
shipped. Fee revenues are recognized on the date services are completed.

INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the
determination of financial statement income, with deferred taxes being provided
for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting.

PURCHASED TAX BENEFITS
The Company purchased tax benefits through leases as provided by the Economic
Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Realized tax benefits, net of repayments, are included
in Deferred Income Taxes.



COMPREHENSIVE EARNINGS
The Company's comprehensive earnings include unrealized gains on investments,
net of tax, and foreign currency translation adjustments with no related income
tax effects. The cumulative amount of other comprehensive (loss) earnings was
$(18,832,000), $68,791,000, and $(19,564,000), at December 31, 2000, 1999, and
1998, respectively.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In September 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus
with respect to EITF Issue 00-10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and
Costs." The purpose of this issue discussion was to clarify the classification
of shipping and handling revenue and costs. The consensus reached was that all
shipping and handling amounts billed to customers should be classified as
revenue.

Additionally, a consensus was reached that the classification of shipping and
handling costs is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed
pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 22, "Disclosures of
Accounting Policies." The Company may adopt a policy of including shipping and
handling costs in cost of sales or in operating expenses. If shipping costs are
material and are not included in cost of sales, disclosure of both the amount of
such costs and the line item on the income statement is required.

Previously, the Company had netted its revenues from shipping and handling
charges billed to customers against the related costs and included the residual
amount as Warehousing, marketing, and administrative expenses on the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The Company has adopted EITF Issue 00-10 and has reclassified billings to
customers for freight and handling charges from Warehousing, marketing, and
administrative expenses to Net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
for all periods presented. Additionally, all freight-out and handling expenses
have been reclassified from Warehousing, marketing, and administrative expenses
to Cost of merchandise sold in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for all
periods presented. The Company defines handling costs as those costs incurred to
fulfill a shipped sales order. The impact of this change was to increase
previously reported Net sales and Cost of merchandise sold while reducing
Warehousing, marketing, and administrative expenses. Reported Operating earnings
and Net earnings did not change.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which was later
amended by Statement No.137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133" and by
Statement No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities -- an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" (collectively,
SFAS No. 133). SFAS No. 133 requires companies to record derivatives on the
balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The accounting
treatment of gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of derivatives
depends on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge
accounting. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001. Adoption
of SFAS No. 133 will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle and will not result in restatement of previously issued
financial statements. Additionally, the Company has determined that SFAS No. 133
will not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial
position.

NOTE 2--CASH FLOWS
The Company considers investments in highly liquid debt instruments, purchased
with an original maturity of ninety days or less, to be cash equivalents. For
cash equivalents, the carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short
maturity of these instruments.

NOTE 3--CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company places temporary cash investments with institutions of high credit
quality and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
institution.

The Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries doing
business in all regions of the United States as well as other areas of North
America. Consequently, no significant concentration of credit risk is considered
to exist.

NOTE 4--INVENTORIES
Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale.

Inventories would have been $211,801,000, $211,490,000, and $217,455,000, higher
than reported at December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively, if the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory accounting had been used for all
Company inventories. Net earnings would have increased (decreased) by $188,000,
$(3,603,000), and $1,056,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and
1998, respectively, using the FIFO method of accounting. Inventories under FIFO
approximate replacement cost.

Note 5--INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES
During 2000, the Company made investments in several Internet related start-up
joint ventures.

On August 1, 2000, the Company completed a transaction that combined the assets
of its OrderZone.com business with Works.com. In addition, the Company invested
$21 million in cash in Works.com and agreed to make Works.com's


purchasing management service and marketplace available to the Company's small
and mid-size customers through Grainger.com. For its contributions, the Company
received a 40% equity stake in the combined company, which is subject to certain
voting and transfer restrictions. Subsequent to August 1, 2000, the Company
accounted for its interest in Works.com using the equity method. The results of
OrderZone.com were included in the consolidated results of the Company through
July 31, 2000.

The Company also made equity investments in three other joint ventures. The
Company accounts for all of these joint ventures using the equity method of
accounting.

As start-up businesses, the time frame or the ultimate ability to achieve
profitability is uncertain. Reaching profitability is also dependent upon the
entities securing sufficient capital funding to support developmental
activities.

The table below summarizes the activity of these investments. The losses reflect
the start-up nature of these businesses.

                                                                   Year Ended December 31, 2000

NOTE 6--INTANGIBLES
Goodwill represents the cost in excess of net assets of acquired companies and
is amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of five to forty years. The
Company's goodwill is predominately denominated in Canadian dollars and,
accordingly, the changes in the asset balance are due to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations.

Customer lists and other intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods of eight to seventeen years.

Note 7--INVESTMENTS
Investments in this category are all available-for-sale securities. These
investments consist of marketable securities and non-publicly traded equity
securities for which a market value is not readily determinable. Marketable
securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses on such
securities reflected, net of taxes, as a separate component of shareholders'
equity. Non-publicly traded equity securities are reported at cost. There have
been no dividends earned on these investments. During 2000, the Company sold a
portion of its investments. The gains on these sales were calculated using the
specific identification method and are reported in Unclassified--net.

The original cost, realized and unrealized gains (pretax), and fair value of
available-for-sale securities are summarized as follows:

                                                                               December 31,

NOTE 10--EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

RETIREMENT PLANS. A majority of the Company's employees are covered by a
noncontributory profit sharing plan. This plan provides for annual employer
contributions based upon a formula related primarily to earnings before federal
income taxes, limited to 15% of the total compensation paid to all eligible
employees. The Company also sponsors additional profit sharing and defined
benefit plans, which cover most of the other employees. Provisions under all
plans were $42,353,000, $55,007,000, and $65,576,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. The Company has a health care benefits plan that
provides coverage to its retired employees and their dependents should they
elect to maintain such coverage. A majority of the Company's employees become
eligible for participation when they qualify for retirement while working for
the Company.

The amounts charged to operating expense for postretirement health care benefits
were $3,767,000, $4,523,000, and $4,256,000 for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Components of the expense were:

Participation in the plan is voluntary at retirement and requires participants
to make contributions, as determined by the Company, toward the cost of the
plan. The accounting for the health plan anticipates future cost-sharing changes
to retiree contributions that will maintain the current cost-sharing ratio
between the Company and the retirees.

A Group Benefit Trust has been established as the vehicle to process benefit
payments. The assets of the trust are invested in a Standard & Poors 500 index
fund. The assumed weighted average long-term rate of return is 6.0%, which is
net of a 33.0% tax rate. The funding of the trust is an estimated amount which
is intended to allow the maximum deductible contribution under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and was $1,385,000, $1,686,000, and
$2,444,000, for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

To determine the APBO as of December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, the assumed
weighted average discount rate used was 7.5%, 7.8%, and 6.8%, respectively. The
assumed health care cost trend rate for 2001 is 8.5%. Beginning in 2002, the
assumed health care cost trend rate declines on a straight-line basis until
2010, when the ultimate trend rate of 5.0% is achieved.

If the assumed health care cost trend rate was increased by one percentage point
for each year, the APBO as of December 31, 2000 would increase by $9,784,000.
The aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2000 net
periodic postretirement benefits expense would increase by $1,462,000.

If the assumed health care cost trend rate was decreased by one percentage point
for each year, the APBO as of December 31, 2000 would decrease by $7,774,000.
The aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 2000 net
periodic postretirement benefits expense would decrease by $1,135,000.

As part of the permanent financing for a Canadian Subsidiary, the Company
maintained a $120,363,000 uncommitted revolving credit facility, denominated in
Canadian dollars. The Company had $120,363,000 outstanding at December 31, 2000
relating to this facility with a weighted average interest rate of 6.05%. The
Company has the intent and the ability to refinance the obligation on a
long-term basis through its credit lines and, therefore, it is included in
long-term debt.



The industrial development revenue bonds include various issues that bear
interest at variable rates up to 15%, or variable rates up to 78.2% of the prime
rate, and come due in various amounts from 2001 through 2021. Interest rates on
some of the issues are subject to change at certain dates in the future. The
bondholders may require the Company to redeem certain bonds concurrent with a
change in interest rates and certain other bonds annually. In addition,
$13,545,000 of these bonds had an unsecured liquidity facility available at
December 31, 2000, for which the Company compensated a bank through a commitment
fee of 0.07%. There were no borrowings related to this facility at December 31,
2000. The Company classified $22,755,000 of bonds currently subject to
redemption options in current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2000.
The Company classified $27,650,000 and $22,755,000 of bonds subject to
redemption options in current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 1999

1999, and 1998, respectively.

NOTE 13--STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS
The Company's Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan ("The Plan") allows the Company to
grant a variety of incentive awards to key employees of the Company. A maximum
of 8,056,828 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the Plan
in connection with awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, phantom stock rights, and other stock-based awards.

The Plan authorizes the granting of restricted stock, which is held by the
Company until terms and conditions specified by the Company are satisfied.
Except for the right of disposal, holders of restricted stock have full
shareholders' rights during the period of restriction, including voting rights
and the right to receive dividends.



The Plan authorizes the granting of options to purchase shares at a price of not
less than 100% of the closing market price on the last trading day preceding the
date of grant. The options expire no later than ten years after the date of
grant.

Shares covered by terminated, surrendered or canceled options and stock
appreciation rights, by forfeited restricted stock, or by the forfeiture of
other awards that do not result in shares being issued, are again available for
awards under the Plan.

There were 367,500 shares of restricted stock issued in 2000 with a weighted
average fair market value of $41.90 per share. There were 42,000 shares of
restricted stock issued in 1999 with a weighted average fair market value of
$45.26 per share. There were 52,500 shares of restricted stock issued in 1998
with a fair market value of $52.04 per share. The shares vest over periods from
four to ten years from issuance, although accelerated vesting is provided in
certain instances. Restricted stock released totaled 5,000, 0, and 400 shares in
2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Compensation expense related to restricted
stock awards is based upon market prices at date of grant and is charged to
earnings on a straight-line basis over the period of restriction. Total
compensation expense related to restricted stock was $6,301,000, $2,178,000, and
$2,022,000 in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

During 1997, the Company adopted a Director Stock Plan in which non-employee
directors participate. A total of 500,000 shares of common stock were reserved
for issuance in connection with awards of stock, stock units, stock options,
restricted stock, and other stock-based awards under the new plan.

A retainer fee for Board service is paid to non-employee directors in the form
of an annual award under the Director Stock Plan of unrestricted shares of
Grainger common stock. The number of shares is equal to the retainer fee divided
by the fair market value of a share of Grainger common stock at the time of the
award, rounded up to the next 10-share increment. Total shares granted were
6,480, 4,680, and 4,500 in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

Non-employee directors additionally receive an annual stock option award under
the Director Stock Plan to purchase shares of Grainger common stock. The number
of shares covered by each option is equal to the award divided by the fair
market value of a share of Grainger common stock at the time of award, rounded
to the next 10-share increment. The per-share option exercise price is 100% of
that value. The options are fully exercisable upon award and have a 10-year
term. Total options granted were 16,560, 16,740, and 11,680 in 2000, 1999, and
1998, respectively.

The Company awarded Stock Units under the Director Stock Plan in connection with
the termination of previous director compensation plans. A Stock Unit is
essentially the economic equivalent of a share of Common stock. Additional
deferred fees and dividends are converted to Stock Units based on the market
value of the stock at the relevant time. Payment of the value of Stock Units
generally will be made after the termination of service as a director. As of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, nine directors held Stock Units. As of December 31,
1998, eight directors held Stock Units. The Company recognized expense of
$426,000, $300,000, and $286,000 for 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Total
stock units outstanding were 45,765, 43,219, and 41,644 in 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively.

The purchased tax benefits represent lease agreements acquired in prior years
under the provisions of the Economic Recovery Act of 1981.

Under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Net Operating Losses (NOLs) represent
temporary differences that enter into the calculation of deferred tax balances.
Since 1997, the Company has experienced NOLs for a foreign start-up operation.
The full amount of the deferred tax asset is offset by a valuation allowance due
to the uncertainty of utilizing these NOLs.

NOTE 15--EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the
combination of weighted average number of shares outstanding and dilutive
potential shares.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31:
                                                                   2000        1999         1998

NOTE 16--ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
The Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which there is outstanding
one preferred share purchase right (Right) for each outstanding share of the
Company's common stock. Each Right, under certain circumstances, may be
exercised to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A-1999 Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (intended to be the economic equivalent of one
share of the Company's common stock) at a price of $250.00, subject to
adjustment. The Rights become exercisable only after a person or a group, other
than a person or group exempt under the plan, acquires or announces a tender
offer for 15% or more of the Company's common stock. If a person or group, other
than a person or group exempt under the plan, acquires 15% or more of the
Company's common stock or if the Company is acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction, each Right generally entitles the holder,
other than such person or group, to purchase, at the then-current exercise
price, stock and/or other securities or assets of the Company or the acquiring
company having a market value of twice the exercise price.

The Rights expire on May 15, 2009, unless earlier redeemed. They generally are
redeemable at $.001 per Right until thirty days following announcement that a
person or group, other than a person or group exempt under the plan, has
acquired 15% or more of the Company's common stock. The Rights do not have
voting or dividend rights and, until they become exercisable, have no dilutive
effect on the earnings of the Company.

NOTE 17--SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has three reported segments: Branch-based Distribution, Digital, and
Lab Safety Supply. The Branch-based Distribution segment provides customers with
solutions to their immediate MRO needs. Branch-based Distribution is an
aggregation of the following business segments: Grainger Industrial Supply,
Grainger.com, Acklands-Grainger Inc., Grainger Export, Grainger Global Sourcing,
Grainger Parts, Grainger, S.A. de C.V. and Puerto Rico. The Digital Business
segment provides e-commerce solutions to customers' MRO and other needs. The
Digital segment is an aggregation of the FindMRO.com, MROverstocks.com, and
TotalMRO.com business segments. Lab Safety Supply is a direct marketer of safety
and other industrial products. Other businesses of the Company include a number
of other businesses, the largest being Grainger Integrated Supply.



The Company's segments offer differing ranges of services and/or products and
require different resources and marketing strategies. The Company's segments
were initially formed in late 1999 as the Company refocused its organization to
meet the diverse needs of its customers.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. Intersegment transfer prices were
established at external selling prices, less costs not incurred due to the
related party sale.
