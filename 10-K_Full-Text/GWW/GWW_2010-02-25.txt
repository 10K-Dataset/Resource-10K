1:  Business

The
Company

W.W. Grainger, Inc.,
incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, distributes facilities
maintenance products and provides related services and information used by
businesses and institutions primarily in the United States, Canada, Japan and
Mexico to keep their facilities and equipment running. In this report, the words
“Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its
subsidiaries.

Grainger is the
leading broad-line supplier of facilities maintenance and other related products
and services in North America. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to
provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products
utilizing sales representatives, direct marketing materials and
catalogs.  Grainger serves approximately 2.0 million customers through
a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers and multiple Web
sites.

During 2009,
Grainger acquired two businesses in the United States and one in
Canada.  Grainger also obtained a controlling interest in a business
in India at 100% and in Japan at 53%.  Their results are consolidated
with Grainger from the acquisition dates.

Grainger’s two
reportable segments are the United States and Canada.  In the first
quarter of 2009, Grainger integrated the Lab Safety business into the Grainger
Industrial Supply business and results are now reported under the United States
segment.  The Canada segment reflects the results for Acklands –
Grainger Inc. Other businesses include the following:  MonotaRO Co.,
Ltd. (Japan), Grainger, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), Grainger Industrial Supply India
Private Limited (India), Grainger Caribe Inc. (Puerto Rico), Grainger China LLC
(China) and Grainger Panama S.A. (Panama).  These businesses generate
revenue through the distribution of facilities maintenance products and provide
related services and information.  Prior year segment amounts have
been restated in a consistent manner.  For segment and geographical
information and consolidated net sales and operating earnings see

“Item
7:  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations”

and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Grainger has
internal business support functions that provide coordination and guidance in
the areas of accounting and finance, business development, communications and
investor relations, compensation and benefits, information systems, health and
safety, human resources, risk management, internal audit, legal, real estate,
security, tax and treasury. These services are provided in varying degrees to
all business units.

Grainger does not
engage in product research and development activities. Items are regularly added
to and deleted from Grainger’s product lines on the basis of customer demand,
market research, recommendations of suppliers, sales volumes and other
factors.

United
States

The
United States business offers a broad selection of facilities maintenance and
other products and provides related services and information through local
branches, catalogs and the Internet. In the first quarter of 2009, the Lab
Safety business was integrated into the U.S. branch-based business. In addition,
two companies were acquired in 2009, Imperial Supplies LLC (Imperial) and
Alliance Energy Solutions (Alliance), further broadening the product offering of
the United States business. Imperial is a national distributor of quality
maintenance products and aftermarket components for the vehicle and fleet
industry; Alliance offers value-added services that help customers drive energy
efficiency and productivity, with particular expertise in the area of lighting
retrofits.

Grainger’s United
States business offers a combination of product breadth, local availability,
speed of delivery, detailed product information and competitively priced
products and services. Products offered include material handling equipment,
safety and security supplies, lighting and electrical products, power and hand
tools, pumps and plumbing supplies, cleaning and maintenance supplies, forestry
and agriculture equipment, building and home inspection supplies, vehicle and
fleet components and many other items primarily focused on the facilities
maintenance market. Services offered include inventory management and energy
efficiency solutions.

The
United States business operates more than 400 branches located in all 50 states.
These branches are located in close proximity to the majority of U.S. businesses
and serve the immediate needs of customers in their local markets by allowing
them to pick up items directly from the branches.  Branches range in
size from small branches to large master branches. The branch network has
approximately 5,000 employees who primarily fulfill counter and will-call
product needs and provide customer service. An average branch is 22,000 square
feet in size, has 12 employees and handles about 110 transactions per day. In
2009, three branches were opened and 17 branches were closed.

The logistics
network is comprised of a network of 14 distribution centers (DCs) of various
sizes, four of which were acquired in a business acquisition during 2009.
Automated equipment and processes in the larger DCs allow them to handle the
majority of the customer shipping for next day availability and replenish over
400 branches that provide same day availability.


The
business has a sales force of approximately 2,400 professionals who help
businesses and institutions select the right products to reduce operating
expenses and improve cash flow, and find immediate solutions to maintenance
problems. Customers range from small and medium-sized businesses to large
corporations, governmental entities and other institutions and are primarily
represented by purchasing managers or workers in facilities maintenance
departments and service shops across a wide range of industries such as:
manufacturing, hospitality, transportation, government, retail, healthcare and
education. Sales transactions during 2009 were made to approximately 1.7 million
customers averaging 95,000 daily transactions. No single customer accounted for
more than 5% of total sales.

The
majority of the products sold by the United States business are national branded
products.  Approximately 24% of 2009 sales consisted of private label
items bearing Grainger’s registered trademarks, including DAYTON® motors,
SPEEDAIRE® air compressors, AIR HANDLER® air filtration equipment, DEM-KOTE®
spray paints, WESTWARD® tools, CONDOR™ safety products and LUMAPRO® lighting
products. Grainger has taken steps to protect these trademarks against
infringement and believes that they will remain available for future use in its
business. Sales of the remaining items generally consisted of products carrying
the names of other well-recognized brands.

The
Grainger catalog, most recently issued in February 2010, offers approximately
307,000 facilities maintenance and other products and is used by customers,
sales representatives and branch personnel to assist in customer product
selection. Approximately 2.4 million copies of the catalog were produced. In
addition, Grainger’s United States business issues target catalogs for its
multiple branded products, as well as other marketing materials.

Customers can also
purchase products through grainger.com. With access to more than 600,000
products, grainger.com serves as a prominent channel for the United States
business.  Grainger.com provides real-time price and product
availability and detailed product information and offers advanced features such
as product search and compare capabilities. For customers with sophisticated
electronic purchasing platforms, Grainger utilizes technology that allows these
systems to communicate directly with grainger.com.  Customers can also
purchase products through several other branded Web sites.

The
United States business purchases products for sale from approximately 2,300 key
suppliers, most of which are manufacturers. No single supplier comprised more
than 2% of total purchases and no significant difficulty has been encountered
with respect to sources of supply.

Through a global
sourcing operation, the business procures competitively priced, high-quality
products produced outside the United States from approximately
340 suppliers. Grainger sells these items primarily under private label
brands. Products obtained through the global sourcing operation include DAYTON®
motors, WESTWARD® tools, LUMAPRO® lighting products and CONDOR™ safety products,
as well as products bearing other trademarks.

Canada

Acklands – Grainger
is Canada’s leading broad-line distributor of industrial and safety supplies. In
2009, Acklands – Grainger acquired substantially all of the assets of the
K&D Pratt Industrial Division, a distributor of industrial and safety
products located in eastern Canada.  The Canadian business serves
customers through more than 160 branches and five DCs across Canada. Acklands –
Grainger distributes tools, fasteners, safety supplies, instruments, welding and
shop equipment, and many other items. During 2009, approximately 13,000 sales
transactions were completed daily. A comprehensive catalog, printed in both
English and French, showcases the product line to facilitate the customer’s
product selection. This catalog, with more than 75,000 products, is used by
customers, sales account managers and branch personnel to assist in customer
product selection. In addition, customers can purchase products through
acklandsgrainger.com, a fully bilingual website.

Other
Businesses

Included in the
other businesses are the operations in Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China,
and Panama.  The more significant businesses in this group are
described below.

Japan

Grainger operates in
Japan through a 53% interest in MonotaRO Co., Ltd.
(MonotaRO).  MonotaRO provides small and mid-sized domestic businesses
with products that help them operate and maintain their
facilities.  MonotaRO is a catalog and a Web-based direct marketer
with approximately 70 percent of orders being conducted through the company’s
Web site, monotaro.com.

Mexico

Grainger’s
operations in Mexico provide local businesses with facilities maintenance
products and other products from both Mexico and the United States. Mexico
distributes products through a network of DCs and branches where customers have
access to approximately 59,000 products through a Spanish-language catalog and
through grainger.com.mx.


China

Grainger operates in
China from a DC in Shanghai and has 10 sales offices throughout China that allow
sales representatives to work remotely and meet with customers. Customers have
access to approximately 59,000 products through a Chinese-language catalog and
through grainger.com.cn.

Seasonality

Grainger’s business
in general is not seasonal, however, there are some products that typically sell
more often during the winter or summer season.  In any given month,
unusual weather patterns, i.e., unusually hot or cold weather, could impact the
sales volumes of these products, either positively or negatively.

Competition

Grainger faces
competition in all markets it serves, from manufacturers (including some of its
own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale
distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and Internet-based
businesses.

Grainger provides
local product availability, a broad product line, sales representatives,
competitive pricing, catalogs (which include product descriptions and, in
certain cases, extensive technical and application data), electronic and
Internet commerce technology and other services such as inventory management and
energy efficiency solutions to assist customers in lowering their total
facilities maintenance costs. Grainger believes that it can effectively compete
with manufacturers on small orders, but manufacturers may have an advantage in
filling large orders.

Grainger serves a
number of diverse markets. Based on available data, Grainger estimates the North
American market for facilities maintenance and related products to be more than
$160 billion, of which Grainger’s share is approximately 4 percent. There
are several large competitors, although most of the market is served by small
local and regional competitors.

Employees

As
of December 31, 2009, Grainger had 18,000 employees, of whom 16,500 were
full-time and 1,500 were part-time or temporary. Grainger has never had a major
work stoppage and considers employee relations to be good.

Web
Site Access to Company Reports

Grainger makes
available, free of charge, through its Web site, its Annual Report on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements
and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after this
material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. This material may be accessed by visiting

Item
1A:  Risk Factors

The
following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to Grainger’s
business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of
operations.

Weakness
in the economy could negatively impact Grainger’s sales growth.

Economic
and industry trends affect Grainger’s business environments. Economic downturns
can cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases and otherwise
reduce their ability to purchase Grainger’s products and services as well as
their ability to make full and timely payments. Thus, a significant or prolonged
slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact Grainger’s sales growth
and results of operations. The recent global economic crisis has had a negative
effect on Grainger’s sales.

The
facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented, and changes in competition
could result in a decreased demand for Grainger’s products and services.

There are several large competitors in the industry, although most of the
market is served by small local and regional competitors. Grainger faces
competition in all markets it serves, from manufacturers (including some of its
own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale
distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and Internet-based businesses.
Competitive pressures could adversely affect Grainger’s sales and
profitability.

Volatility
in commodity prices may adversely affect operating margins.

Some of
Grainger’s products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials,
such as steel, copper, or oil, and are subject to price changes based upon
fluctuations in the commodities market. Grainger’s ability to pass on increases
in costs depends on market conditions. The inability to pass along costs
increases could result in lower operating margins. In addition, higher prices
could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales
volumes.

Unexpected
product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships, resulting in
an adverse impact on results of operations.

Grainger’s competitive
strengths include product selection and availability. Products are purchased
from approximately 3,400 key suppliers, no one of which accounted for more than
2% of total purchases. Historically, no significant difficulty has been
encountered with respect to sources of supply; however,
economic


downturns can
adversely affect a supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver products. If
Grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products, there could be a
short-term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer-term adverse
effect on customer relationships and Grainger’s reputation. In addition,
Grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors. In the event Grainger was
unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing
advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of
operations.

The
addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth.

Grainger,
from time to time, expands the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number
of products it distributes. In 2006, Grainger launched a multiyear product line
expansion program. The continued success of this program is expected to be a
driver of growth in 2010 and beyond. Its success will depend on Grainger’s
ability to accurately forecast market demand, obtain products from suppliers and
effectively integrate these products into the supply chain. As such, there is a
risk that the product line expansion program will not deliver the expected
results which could negatively impact anticipated future sales
growth.

Interruptions
in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and
cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues.

The
proper functioning of Grainger’s information systems is critical to the
successful operation of its business. Although Grainger’s information systems
are protected with robust backup systems, including physical and software
safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still
vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access,
telecommunication failures and other problems. If critical information systems
fail or are otherwise unavailable, Grainger’s ability to process orders,
maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses
and maintain the security of Company and customer data, could be adversely
affected.

In
order to compete, Grainger must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and
the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of
operations.

In order to compete and have continued growth,
Grainger must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees,
including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing and support
positions. Grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and
develop their skills and competencies. Grainger’s operating results could be
adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for
employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit
costs.

Fluctuations
in foreign currency have an effect on reported results of
operations.

Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations
have an impact on sales, costs and cash flows from international operations, and
could affect reported financial performance.

Acquisitions
involve a number of inherent risks, any of which could result in the benefits
anticipated not being realized and have an adverse effect on results of
operations.

Acquisitions,
both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties
in assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential
profitability of acquired companies. There is a risk of potential losses of key
employees of an acquired business and an ability to achieve identified operating
and financial synergies anticipated to result from an
acquisition.  Additionally, problems could arise from the integration
of the acquired business including unanticipated changes in the business
or industry, or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions
underlying the acquisition.  Any one or more of these factors could
cause Grainger not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the
acquisitions or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units.
Accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions
could become impaired.

Item
1B:  Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item
2:  Properties

As of December 31,
2009, Grainger’s owned and leased facilities totaled 22.4 million square feet,
an increase of approximately 8% from December 31, 2008. This increase is
primarily the result of business acquisitions.  Additionally, in 2009
Grainger purchased a facility of approximately one million square feet for a new
distribution center in Illinois to be opened in 2012.  Land was also
purchased in California for a new distribution center to be opened in
2011.  The United States business and Acklands – Grainger
accounted for the majority of the total square footage. Acklands – Grainger
facilities are located throughout Canada.

Branches in the
United States range in size from 1,300 to 109,000 square feet. Most are located
in or near major metropolitan areas with many located in industrial parks.
Typically, a branch is on one floor, consists primarily of warehouse space,
sales areas and offices and has off-the-street parking for customers and
employees. Distribution centers in the United States range in size from 45,000
to 1,300,000 square feet. Grainger believes that its properties are generally in
excellent condition and well maintained.


A
brief description of significant facilities follows:

(1)

United States
      branches consist of 288 owned and 135 leased properties. Most leases
      expire between 2010 and 2018.

(2)

These
      facilities are primarily owned.

(3)

These
      facilities include both owned and leased locations, consisting of storage
      facilities, office space, and idle properties including the one million
      square foot facility for a new distribution center in
      Illinois.

(4)

Acklands –
      Grainger facilities consist of general offices, distribution centers and
      branches, of which 58 are owned and 115
leased.

(5)

These
      facilities include owned and leased locations in Japan, Mexico, India,
      Puerto Rico, China and Panama.

(6)

Owned
      facilities are not subject to any
mortgages.

Item
3:  Legal Proceedings

Grainger has been
named, along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies, as a defendant in
litigation in various states involving asbestos and/or silica. These lawsuits
typically assert claims of personal injury arising from alleged exposure to
asbestos and/or silica as a consequence of products purportedly distributed by
Grainger. As of February 2, 2010, Grainger is named in cases filed on behalf of
approximately 1,900 plaintiffs in which there is an allegation of exposure to
asbestos and/or silica.  Grainger has denied, or intends to deny, the
allegations in all of the above-described lawsuits.

In
2009, lawsuits relating to asbestos and/or silica and involving approximately
470 plaintiffs were dismissed with respect to Grainger, typically based on the
lack of product identification. If a specific product distributed by Grainger is
identified in any of these lawsuits, Grainger would attempt to exercise
indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer. In addition, Grainger
believes that a substantial number of these claims are covered by
insurance.  Grainger has entered agreements with its major insurance
carriers relating to the scope, coverage and costs of defense.  While
Grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits, it believes that
the ultimate resolution will not have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a material adverse effect on Grainger’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

Grainger is a party
to a contract with the United States General Services Administration (the “GSA”)
first entered into in 1999 and subsequently extended in 2004.  The GSA
contract had been the subject of an audit performed by the GSA’s Office of the
Inspector General.  In December 2007, the Company received a letter
from the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Civil Division of the Department of
Justice (the “DOJ”) regarding the GSA contract. The letter suggested that the
Company had not complied with its disclosure obligations and the contract’s
pricing provisions, and had potentially overcharged government customers under
the contract.

Discussions relating
to the Company’s compliance with its disclosure obligations and the contract’s
pricing provisions are ongoing.  The timing and outcome of these
discussions are uncertain and could include settlement or civil litigation by
the DOJ to recover, among other amounts, treble damages and penalties under the
False Claims Act.  While this matter is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, an unfavorable
resolution could result in significant payments by the Company.  The
Company continues to believe that it has complied with the GSA contract in all
material respects.

Grainger is a party
to a contract with the United States Postal Service (the “USPS”) entered into in
2003 covering the sale of certain Maintenance Repair and Operating Supplies (the
“MRO Contract”).  The Company received a subpoena dated August 29,
2008, from the USPS Office of Inspector General seeking information about the
Company’s pricing compliance under the MRO Contract.  The Company has
provided responsive information to the USPS but no substantive discussions have
yet begun.

Grainger is also a
party to a contract with the USPS entered into in 2001 covering the sale of
certain janitorial and custodial items (the “Custodial
Contract”).  The Company received a subpoena dated June 30, 2009, from
the USPS Office of Inspector General seeking information about the Company’s
pricing practices and compliance under the Custodial Contract.  The
Company has provided responsive information to the USPS but no substantive
discussions have yet begun.


The
timing and outcome of the USPS investigations of the MRO Contract and the
Custodial Contract are uncertain and could include settlement or civil
litigation by the USPS to recover, among other amounts treble damages and
penalties under the False Claims Act.  While these matters are
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position, an unfavorable resolution could result in significant payments by
the Company.  The Company continues to believe that it has complied
with each of the MRO Contract and the Custodial Contract in all material
respects.

In
addition to the foregoing, from time to time Grainger is involved in various
other legal and administrative proceedings that are incidental to its business,
including claims relating to product liability, premises liability, general
negligence, environmental issues, employment, intellectual property and other
matters. As a government contractor selling to Federal, state and local
governmental entities, Grainger is also subject to governmental or regulatory
inquiries or audits or other proceedings, including those related to pricing
compliance. It is not expected that the ultimate resolution of any of these
matters will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on Grainger’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

*In the first
quarter of 2009, Grainger adopted authoritative guidance on “Determining Whether
Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating
Securities.” As a result, earnings per share were calculated under the new
accounting guidance for 2009, and restated for 2008 and
2007.  Earnings per share for 2006 and 2005 were calculated using the
treasury stock method and not restated because it was not practical and the
impact is not considered material.

Item
7:  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Overview

General

.

Grainger
distributes facilities maintenance products and provides related services and
information used by businesses and institutions primarily in the United States,
Canada, Japan and Mexico to keep their facilities and equipment running.
Grainger has two reportable segments: the United States and
Canada.  Grainger integrated the Lab Safety Supply business into the
Grainger Industrial Supply business in 2009 and results are now reported under
the United States segment.  The Canada segment reflects the results
for Acklands – Grainger Inc.  Other businesses include the following:
MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (Japan), Grainger, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), Grainger Industrial
Supply India Private Limited (India), Grainger Caribe Inc. (Puerto Rico),
Grainger China LLC (China) and Grainger Panama S.A. (Panama).

Grainger
uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options
for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives, direct
marketing materials and catalogs. Grainger serves approximately 2.0 million
customers through a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers
and multiple Web sites.

Business
Environment

.

Several
economic factors and industry trends shape Grainger’s business environment and
projections for the coming year. Historically, Grainger’s sales trends have
tended to correlate positively with industrial production and non-farm
payrolls.  In February 2010, Consensus Forecast-USA reported a 2009
decline of 9.7% and 2.4% for Industrial Production and GDP,
respectively.  According to the Federal Reserve, non-farm payrolls
decreased 3.1% from December 2008 to December 2009.  The continued
decline in the economy affected Grainger’s sales growth for 2009, which declined
9 percent.

In
February 2010, Consensus Forecast-USA projected 2010 GDP growth of 3.1% and
Industrial Production growth of 4.9% for the United States. In February 2010,
Consensus Forecast-USA projected GDP growth of 2.7% for Canada, as compared with
a 2.5% estimated decline in 2009.

The
light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised
approximately 24% of Grainger’s total 2009 sales, have historically
correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production.
Manufacturing employment levels in the United States declined approximately 9.9%
from December 2008 to December 2009, while manufacturing output decreased 1.3%
from December 2008 to December 2009. This decline in manufacturing employment
and output contributed to a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing
customer sector and a high single-digit decline in the light manufacturing
customer sector for Grainger in 2009.

Outlook

.

While
in early 2010 there are some initial signs of improvement in the overall
economy, job growth is expected to lag the economic
recovery.  Grainger expects positive sales growth in 2010 of 6 to 10
percent which will be realized through the impact of acquisitions made in 2009,
favorable foreign exchange rates and organic growth.  Beginning in
2006, Grainger has added approximately 234,000 new products as part of its
multiyear product line expansion program in the United States, of which 70,000
were added to the 2010 catalog, issued in February.  Products were
added to supplement the plumbing, fastener, material handling and security
product lines. The product line expansion program has been a positive
contributor to sales since being launched, and is expected to continue to be a
driver of growth in 2010 and beyond. Grainger plans to continue to invest in the
business and may choose to fund some additional sales and marketing programs to
increase market share if sales trends accelerate in 2010.

Operating expenses
are expected to increase in 2010 compared to 2009, due in part to incremental
expenses from the businesses acquired in 2009.  In addition, part of
the expenses eliminated in 2009 as a result of lowering the cost structure will
return, such as merit increases and incentive compensation.  Grainger
expects some reduction in operating expenses in 2010 from changes in its paid
time off program, partially offsetting these increases.

Capital expenditures
are expected to range from $150 million to $175 million in 2010. Projected
investments include continued investments in distribution centers, information
technology, and the normal recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger expects
to fund 2010 capital investments from operating cash flows.

Matters
Affecting Comparability

.

There
were 255 sales days in 2009 and 2007, compared to 256 sales days in
2008.

Grainger completed
several acquisitions throughout 2008 and 2009, all of which were immaterial
individually, and in the aggregate.  Grainger’s operating results have
included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition
date.

Effective January 1,
2009, Grainger revised its segment disclosure.  Prior year amounts
have been restated in a consistent manner.

Compared to 2008

Grainger’s net sales
of $6,222.0 million for 2009 decreased 9.2% when compared with net sales of
$6,850.0 million for 2008. There was one less selling day in 2009 versus 2008.
Daily sales were down 8.8%.  Sales were negatively affected by a
decline in volume of approximately 14 percentage points, partially offset by
price increases of approximately 5 percentage points.  In addition,
sales were negatively affected by 1 percentage point due to foreign exchange,
while sales from acquisitions contributed approximately 1 percentage
point.  The overall decrease in net sales was led by a mid 20 percent
decline in the heavy manufacturing customer sector, followed by a low 20 percent
decline in the reseller customer sector and a mid-teen percent decline in the
contractor customer sector.  The government customer sector performed
the strongest as sales were flat for 2009, followed by a mid single-digit
decline in the commercial customer sector.  Refer to the

Segment
Analysis

below for further details.

Gross profit of
$2,598.5 million for 2009 decreased 7.5%.  The gross profit margin for
2009 increased 0.8 percentage point to 41.8% from 41.0% in 2008.  The
improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by price increases
exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by an increase in the mix of
sales to large customers which are generally at lower margins.

Operating expenses
of $1,933.3 million for 2009 decreased 4.6% from $2,025.6 million for 2008.
Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a
result of lower headcount, profit sharing and incentive
compensation.  Non-payroll related expenses also decreased due to cost
containment efforts.

Operating earnings
of $665.2 million for 2009 decreased 15.0% from $782.7 million for
2008.  The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to the
decline in sales combined with operating expenses, which declined at a lower
rate than sales. These declines were partially offset by an increase in gross
profit margin.

Net
earnings for 2009 decreased by 9.4% to $430.5 million from $475.4 million
in 2008. The decline in net earnings for 2009 primarily resulted from the
decline in operating earnings, partially offset by the one-time noncash pre-tax
gain of $47.4 million ($28 million after tax) from the step-up of the investment
in MonotaRO after Grainger became a majority owner in September
2009.  Diluted earnings per share of $5.62 in 2009 were 5.9% lower
than $5.97 for 2008, primarily due to the decline in net earnings, partially
offset by lower shares outstanding.  In the first quarter of 2009,
Grainger adopted authoritative guidance regarding “Determining Whether
Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating
Securities,” resulting in a seven cent reduction to the previously reported 2008
diluted earnings per share.

Segment
Analysis

The
following comments at the segment and business unit level include external and
intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

United
States

Net
sales were $5,445.4 million for 2009, a decrease of $612.4 million, or 10.1%,
when compared with net sales of $6,057.8 million for 2008.  Daily
sales in the United States were down 9.8%.  All customer sectors were
negatively impacted by economic conditions.  The overall decrease in
net sales was led by a mid 20 percent decline in the heavy manufacturing
customer sector and in the reseller customer sector.  The contractor
and light manufacturing customer sectors declined in the mid-teens and high
single digits, respectively, while the government customer sector


performed the
strongest with flat sales for 2009.  Due to the impact of acquisitions
made in 2009, favorable foreign exchange rates and organic growth, sales are
expected to improve in 2010.

Beginning in 2006,
Grainger has added approximately 234,000 new products to supplement the
plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines as part of the
business’ ongoing product line expansion initiative. The most recent catalog,
issued in February 2010, offers a total of 307,000 products, an increase of
70,000 products over the 2009 catalog.

The
segment gross profit margin increased 1.3 percentage points in 2009 over
2008.  The improvement in gross profit margin was primarily driven by
price increases exceeding product cost increases, partially offset by an
increase in the mix of lower margin sales to large customers.

Operating expenses
in this segment were down 4.6% for 2009.  Operating expenses decreased
primarily due to lower payroll and benefits as a result of reduced headcount,
lower profit sharing and no incentive compensation, partially offset by an
increase in severance costs.  Non-payroll related expenses also
decreased due to cost containment efforts.

For
the segment, operating earnings of $735.6 million for 2009 decreased 12.5% over
$840.4 million for 2008.  This decrease in operating earnings for
2009 was primarily due to the decline in net sales and operating expenses which
declined at a lower rate than sales, partially offset by an increase in gross
profit margin.

Canada

Net
sales were $651.2 million for 2009, a decrease of $76.8 million, or 10.6%, when
compared with $728.0 million for 2008.  Daily sales were down 10.2%
and in local currency, daily sales decreased 3.9% for 2009.  The
decrease in net sales was led by declines in the heavy manufacturing and
contractor customer sectors driven by economic conditions.  Partially
offsetting these declines were strong sales to the utilities customer sector
driven by special projects, and to higher sales to the government.

The
gross profit margin decreased 1.1 percentage points in 2009 over
2008.  The decline in the gross profit margin was primarily due to
cost increases exceeding price increases and an increase in the mix of lower
margin sales, particularly to large customers.

Operating expenses
decreased 11.5% in 2009.  In local currency, operating expenses
decreased 5.6% primarily due to lower commissions and incentive compensation
accruals, and non-payroll related expenses including lower travel and
advertising costs.  In addition, 2008 included expenses related to the
bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services.

Operating earnings
of $43.7 million for 2009 were down $10.5 million, or 19.4% for 2009. In local
currency, operating earnings decreased 15.6% primarily due to the decline in net
sales and gross profit margin.

Other
Businesses

Net
sales for other businesses, which include Japan, Mexico, India, Puerto Rico,
China and Panama, were up 47.7% for 2009.  Daily sales increased
48.3%.  The increase in net sales was due primarily to the inclusion
of results from the acquisitions of the businesses in India and Japan, along
with a positive contribution from China. Operating losses for other businesses
were $11.6 million for 2009, a 1.6% improvement compared to operating losses of
$11.8 million for 2008.

Other
Income and Expense

Other income and
expense was $42.1 million of income in 2009, an increase of $51.6 million as
compared with $9.5 million of expense in 2008.  The following table
summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of
dollars):

The
change from net expense to net income was primarily attributable to the one-time
noncash gain of $47.4 million from the step-up of the investment in MonotaRO
after Grainger became a majority owner in September 2009.  In
addition, 2008 included the write-off of a joint venture investment in India as
described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other operating
income is lower primarily due to lower foreign currency transactions gains
versus 2008.


Income
Taxes

Income taxes of
$276.6 million in 2009 decreased 7.2% as compared with $297.9 million in
2008.  Grainger’s effective tax rates were 39.1% and 38.5% in 2009 and
2008, respectively. The increase in the tax rate in 2009 was primarily driven by
increased U.S. state tax rates.

For
2010, Grainger is projecting its estimated effective tax rate to be
approximately 39.3%.  The increase is primarily due to current
estimates of the U.S. state tax rates and unfavorable impacts of non-U.S. tax
jurisdictions.

Compared to 2007

Grainger’s net sales
of $6,850.0 million for 2008 increased 6.7% when compared with net sales of
$6,418.0 million for 2007. There was one more selling day in 2008 versus 2007.
Daily sales were up 6.3%. The increase in net sales was led by high single-digit
sales growth in the government sector, and mid single-digit sales growth in the
commercial and reseller sectors. Approximately 1 percentage point of the sales
growth came from Grainger’s product line expansion initiative and approximately
5 percentage points came from price and volume. Refer to the

Segment
Analysis

below for further detail of Grainger’s ongoing strategic
initiatives.

The
gross profit margin for 2008 improved 0.4 percentage point to 41.0% from 40.6%
in 2007. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by
price increases exceeding cost increases, partially offset by an increase in the
mix of sales to large customers which are generally at lower
margins.

Operating earnings
of $782.7 million for 2008 increased 16.7% over the $670.7 million for
2007. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an
improved gross profit margin and positive operating expense
leverage.

Net
earnings for 2008 increased by 13.1% to $475.4 million from $420.1 million
in 2007. The growth in net earnings for 2008 primarily resulted from the
improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by lower interest income,
higher interest expense and the write-off of Grainger’s $6.0 million investment
in Grainger Industrial Supply India Private Limited, formerly known as Asia
Pacific Brands India Private Limited. Diluted earnings per share of $5.97 in
2008 were 21.6% higher than the $4.91 for 2007. This improvement was higher than
the percentage increase for net earnings due to the effect of Grainger’s share
repurchase program.

Segment
Analysis

The
following comments at the segment and business unit level include external and
intersegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

United
States

Net
sales were $6,057.8 million for 2008, an increase of $328.5 million, or 5.7%,
when compared with net sales of $5,729.3 million for 2007. Daily sales were up
5.3%. Sales were led by high single-digit sales growth in the government sector,
and mid single-digit sales growth in the commercial and reseller sectors.
Approximately 2 percentage points of the sales growth came from the product
line expansion initiative and approximately 4 percentage points came from price
and volume. Sales volume was negatively affected by approximately
1 percentage point due to a decline in sales of seasonal
products.

In
2004, a multiyear market expansion program was launched to strengthen Grainger’s
presence in top metropolitan markets and better position it to serve local
customers.  The market expansion program was completed in 2008,
however, the benefits realized from this initiative are expected to
continue.

Consistent with the
overall downturn in the economy, beginning in October most of these markets saw
negative sales growth, which significantly affected sales growth for 2008.
Results for the market expansion program were as follows:

Over the
past three years, over 150,000 new products have been added to supplement the
plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines as part of the
business’ ongoing product line expansion initiative. The catalog, issued in
2009, offered a total of 237,000 products, an increase of 50,000 products over
the 2008 catalog.

The
segment gross profit margin increased 0.4 percentage point in 2008 over 2007,
driven primarily by price increases exceeding cost increases, partially offset
by an increase in the mix of lower margin sales to large customers.


Operating expenses
in this segment were up 3.3% in 2008. Expenses grew at a slower rate than sales
primarily due to lower advertising expenses, incentive compensation, severance
and lower bad debt expense, the result of improved collection
efficiency.

For
the segment, operating earnings of $840.4 million for 2008 increased 14.9% over
the $731.6 million for 2007. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales
growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and positive operating
expense leverage.

Canada

Net
sales were $728.0 million for 2008, an increase of $91.5 million, or 14.4%, when
compared with $636.5 million for 2007. Daily sales were up 13.9%. In local
currency, daily sales increased 13.1%. The increase was led by sales growth in
the contractor, agriculture and mining and government sectors.  Macro
economic factors such as higher commodity prices for oil, gas and mineral
products drove a significant portion of this growth due to an increase in
customer demand in these sectors.  Sales to new customers and
increased sales penetration to existing customers was also a contributing factor
to these increases.

The
gross profit margin increased 0.3 percentage points in 2008 over 2007. The
improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily due to price increases
exceeding cost increases.

Operating expenses
were up 13.7% in 2008. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to
payroll and benefits as a result of increased headcount, merit increases and
commissions, and higher advertising and occupancy expenses, and expenses related
to the bankruptcy of a provider of freight payment services.

Operating earnings
of $54.3 million for 2008 were up $10.0 million, or 22.7%. This earnings
improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit
margin and operating expenses that grew at a slower rate than
sales.

Other
Businesses

Net
sales for other businesses, which include Mexico, Puerto Rico, China and Panama,
were up 19.5% for 2008.  Daily sales increased 19.0%. The increase in
net sales was due primarily to Mexico as sales increased 11.9% in 2008 versus
2007. Daily sales were up 11.5%.  In local currency, daily sales were
up 12.7%, driven primarily by increased market share coming from the ongoing
branch expansion program. Operating losses for other businesses were $11.8
million for 2008, a 57.8% increase over operating losses of $7.5 million for
2007.

Other
Income and Expense

Other income and
expense was $9.5 million of expense in 2008, compared with $11.2 million of
income in 2007. The following table summarizes the components of other income

The
change from net interest income to net interest expense was primarily
attributable to the four-year bank term loan obtained in May 2008. The write-off
of the investment relates to Grainger Industrial Supply India Private Limited,
formerly known as Asia Pacific Brands India Private Limited as described in Note
6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other non-operating income increased
primarily due to higher foreign exchange transaction gains.

Income
Taxes

Income taxes of
$297.9 million in 2008 increased 13.8% as compared with $261.7 million in 2007.
Grainger’s effective tax rates were 38.5% and 38.4% in 2008 and 2007,
respectively.


Financial
Condition

Grainger expects its
strong working capital position, cash flows from operations and borrowing
capacity to continue, allowing it to fund its operations, including growth
initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchase of shares, as
well as pay cash dividends.

cash flows from operations of $732.4 million in 2009, $530.1 million in 2008 and
$468.9 million in 2007 continued to improve Grainger’s financial position and
serve as the primary source of funding. Contributing to cash flows from
operations were net earnings for 2009 of $430.8 million and the effect of
noncash expenses such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and
amortization, partially offset by the noncash pre-tax gain of $47.3 million from
unconsolidated entities after Grainger became a majority owner.  Also
contributing to net cash provided by operating activities were changes in
operating assets and liabilities, which resulted in a net source of cash of
$121.8 million for 2009.  The principal operating source of cash was a
decrease in inventory due to lower purchases.

Other
current liabilities declined primarily due to reduced profit sharing and
incentive compensation accruals.

Net
cash provided by operations increased $61.2 million in 2008 over 2007, driven
primarily by increased net earnings. The Change in operating assets and
liabilities – net of business acquisitions reduced cash by $143.1 million in
2008. This use of cash was driven primarily by an increase in inventory due to
the product line expansion initiative.

Net
cash flows used in investing activities were $262.6 million, $202.6 million and
$197.0 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash expended for property,
buildings, equipment and capitalized software was $142.4 million, $195.0 million
and $197.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additional information
regarding capital spending is detailed in the

Capital
Expenditures

section below. In 2009, Grainger funded infrastructure
improvement projects in the distribution centers in the United States, Canada
and Mexico, and paid $121.8 million for business acquisitions and other
investments, net of cash received. In 2008, Grainger continued to fund the
Company’s market expansion initiative.

Net
cash flows used in financing activities for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $413.5
million, $36.8 million and $513.9 million, respectively. Proceeds from the
four-year bank term loan of $500 million were included in
2008.  Treasury stock purchases were $372.7 million in 2009 as
Grainger repurchased 4.5 million shares compared to purchases of $394.2 million
in 2008 to repurchase 5.5 million shares. As of December 31, 2009, approximately
3.1 million shares of common stock remained available under Grainger’s
repurchase authorization. Dividends paid to shareholders were $134.7 million in
2009 versus $121.5 million in 2008. Grainger also used cash in financing
activities to repay $18.9 million of long-term debt borrowings in 2009 and $81.4
million to repay short-term borrowings in 2008. In 2007, treasury stock
purchases were $647.3 million for 7.2 million shares and dividends paid to
shareholders were $113.1 million.

Working
Capital

Internally generated
funds have been the primary source of working capital and of funds used in
business expansion, supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated. In addition,
funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support
growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other
infrastructure improvements.

Working capital was
$1,354.7 million at December 31, 2009, compared with $1,382.4 million at
December 31, 2008 and $974.4 million at December 31, 2007. At these dates, the
ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.7, 2.8 and 2.2. Working
capital and the current ratio were essentially flat in 2009 compared to
2008.  The increase in the current ratio and working capital from 2007
to 2008 primarily related to increases in cash and inventories and the
replacement of short-term borrowings with long-term borrowings.

Capital
Expenditures

In each of the past
three years, a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to
property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the
following table (in thousands of dollars):

In 2009, significant
capital expenditures included investments in the United States distribution
center network.  In addition, there was continued investment in Canada
and other international branches and distribution centers, as well as the normal
recurring replacement of equipment.


In
2008, Grainger substantially completed its investments in the market expansion
program in the United States which realigned branches in the top 25 major
metropolitan areas. In addition, there was continued international investment,
including branch expansion in Mexico, as well as the normal recurring
replacement of equipment.

In
2007, Grainger’s investments included the market expansion program, Mexico and
China expansion and the normal recurring replacement of equipment.

Capital expenditures
are expected to range from $150 million to $175 million in 2010. Projected
investments include continued investments in distribution centers, information
technology, and the normal recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger expects
to fund 2010 capital investments from operating cash flows.

Debt

Grainger maintains a
debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working
capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally
generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including
bank borrowings under lines of credit. A four-year bank term loan of $500
million was obtained in May 2008. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt
and for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2009, Grainger’s long-term
debt rating by Standard & Poor’s was AA+. Grainger’s available lines of
credit, as further discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
were $250.0 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total
debt as a percent of total capitalization was 19.1%, 20.7% and 5.0% as of the
same dates. The increase in total debt as a percent of total capitalization in
2008 was primarily the result of the $500 million bank term loan. Grainger
believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with
respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on
its results of operations or financial position.

Commitments

Purchase obligations
for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs.
While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases
are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for
cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the
contract.

Other liabilities
represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and
postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial
projections. Other employment-related benefits costs of $39.1 million have not
been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not
statistically predictable. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

See
also Notes 9 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail
related to the interest on long-term debt and operating lease obligations,
respectively.

Grainger has
recorded a noncurrent liability of $27.9 million for tax uncertainties and
interest at December 31, 2009. This amount is excluded from the table above, as
Grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period. See Note
16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

Grainger does not
have any material exposures to off-balance sheet
arrangements.  Grainger does not have any variable interest entities
or activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair
value.


Critical
Accounting Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases
its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes
are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates,
the revisions are included in Grainger’s results of operations for the period in
which the actual amounts become known.

Accounting policies
are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about
matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when
there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made, which
would have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger’s financial
condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations.

Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies
used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most
significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual
results in these areas could differ materially from management’s estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

.  Grainger uses several factors to
estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age
of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of
the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic
conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or
a specific customer. Write-offs could be materially different than the reserves
provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical
trends.

Inventory
Reserves

.

Grainger
establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory.
Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account
for unmeasured usage or loss. Actual inventory shrinkage could be materially
different from these estimates, affecting Grainger’s inventory values and cost
of merchandise sold.

Grainger regularly
reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or
excess quantities of inventory. Grainger records provisions for the difference
between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value.
Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market
conditions and liquidation values. Actual results differing from these
projections could have a material effect on Grainger’s results of
operations.

Goodwill
and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets

.

Grainger’s
business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other
intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly
impairment write-downs that Grainger may incur in future periods. Grainger
annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives for
impairment and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Grainger
determines fair value using an income approach, in conjunction with relevant
market information which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding
future profitability of acquired businesses. Grainger believes that it does not
have a material amount of goodwill at risk of failing the goodwill impairment
test; however, due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors
and market conditions, impairment charges could occur in future
periods.

Stock
Incentive Plans

.

Grainger
maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be
awarded to employees and directors. Grainger uses a binomial lattice option
pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants. The model requires
projections of the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, expected
dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants. The fair value of
options granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007 used the following
assumptions:

For the years
      ended December 31,




Risk-free
      interest rate

2.4

%

3.2

%

4.6

%

Expected
      life

      years

      years

      years

Expected
      volatility

28.8

%

25.2

%

24.3

%

Expected
      dividend yield

2.3

%

1.8

%

1.7

%


The
risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected
term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted
during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are
expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders’ exercise
and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and
historical volatility of the closing price of Grainger’s stock over a period
equal to the expected life of each option grant. The dividend yield assumption
is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts. Because stock option
compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been
reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture
experience.

The
amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the
valuation model and these assumptions. If a different valuation model or
different assumptions were used, the stock option compensation expense could be
significantly different from what is recorded in the current
period.

Compensation expense
for other stock-based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last
trading date preceding the date of the grant.

For
additional information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Postretirement
Healthcare Benefits

.

Postretirement
healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and
estimates used in calculating such amounts.  The assumptions used
include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets
and healthcare cost trend rates and certain employee related factors, such as
turnover, retirement age and mortality rates. Changes in these and other
assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for
example) could have a material effect on Grainger’s postretirement benefit
obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and
financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary
decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding
the postretirement benefit obligation.

The
discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on
high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement
date, of each year. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of
benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. As of
December 31, 2009, Grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation
of

its
postretirement plan obligation from 5.9% to 6.0% to reflect the increase in
market interest rates. Grainger estimates that this increase in the discount
rate will increase 2010 pretax earnings by approximately $0.6 million, although
other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this
effect.

Grainger considers
the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical
performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in developing its expected
long-term return on plan assets. In 2009, Grainger maintained the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% (net of tax at 40%) based on the
historical average of long-term rates of return.

A 1
percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had
the following effects on December 31, 2009 results (in thousands of
dollars):

1 Percentage
      Point

Increase

(Decrease)

Effect on
      total of service and interest cost

$

5,278

$

(4,100

)

Effect on
      accumulated postretirement benefit obligation

44,290

(34,925

)

In
2009, Grainger changed the mortality table used in the postretirement valuation
from RP2000 to the IRS 2008 Fully Generational Mortality Table which builds in
future increases in healthcare rates and expenses due to improved mortality
rates.  This change resulted in a $13.9 million increase of the
postretirement healthcare obligation as of December 31, 2009, and is estimated
to decrease 2010 pretax earnings by approximately $2.5 million.  Other
changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this
effect.


Grainger may
terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the
provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is
terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the
participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the
postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate,
different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be
applicable.

Grainger has used
its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such
assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may
be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and,
therefore, may affect Grainger’s retirement plan obligations and future
expense.

For
additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note
10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Insurance
Reserves

.

Grainger
retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers’
compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of
high deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk
areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance.

Grainger is
responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves. Although
it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control
over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment
patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks,
which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels.

The
use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves
over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the
current period’s results of operations.

Income
Taxes

.

Grainger
recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or
tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income
tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management’s interpretations of
the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger’s
best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future
taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities and
uncertain tax positions. Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in
tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income
and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate
and tax balances recorded by Grainger.

Other.

Other
significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement
uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an
understanding of the financial statements. Policies such as revenue recognition,
depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets and warranties require judgments on
complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of
authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or
assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material
effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More
information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.


New
Accounting Standards

The
following new accounting standards exclude those pronouncements that are
unlikely to have an effect on Grainger upon adoption.

In
December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding employer’s
disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets, codified primarily in ASC
715.  ASC 715 requires expanded disclosures about investment policies
and strategies for the plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other
postretirement plan, including information regarding major categories of assets,
input and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and
significant concentrations of risk within the plans.  The Company has
applied the provision of ASC 715 and the adoption did not have a material effect
on the Company’s results of operations or financial position.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued “The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the
Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” codified in ASC 105,
which established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of
authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to be applied by
non-governmental entities.  The Accounting Standards Codification
superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting
standards.  ASC 105 was effective for interim or annual financial
periods ending after September 15, 2009.  The Company has applied this
statement and the adoption did not have a material effect on its results of
operations or financial position.

Inflation

Inflation during the
last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant
use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and
accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes
result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial
statements.

Some of Grainger’s
products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as
steel, copper or oil, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations
in the commodities market. Grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost
increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of
operations.

Grainger believes
the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of
investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles, which
include improving productivity, maintaining working capital turnover and
offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the
marketplace.

Forward-Looking
Statements

This Form 10-K
contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results
and business plans, strategies and objectives and other matters that may be
deemed to be “forward-looking statements” under the federal securities laws.
Grainger has generally identified such forward-looking statements by using words
such as “anticipate, anticipated, assumed, assumes, assumption, assumptions,
believe, believes, continue, continued, continues, continues to believe it
complies, could, estimate, estimated, estimates, expectation, expected, expects,
forecast, forecasts, had potentially, intended, intends, likely, may, might,
plans, predict, predictable, presumption, project, projected, projecting,
projection, projections, potential, reasonably likely, scheduled, should,
tended, timing and outcome are uncertain, unanticipated, unlikely, will, will be
realized, and would” or similar expressions.

Grainger cannot
guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although Grainger
does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are
reasonable. Achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties
which could cause Grainger’s results to differ materially from those which are
presented.

Factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a
forward-looking statement include, without limitation:  higher product
costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of source
of supply; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or
implement new technologies or business strategies; the outcome of pending and
future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings; investigations,
inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; disruption of information
technology or data security systems; general industry or market conditions;
general global economic conditions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market
volatility; commodity price volatility; labor shortages; facilities disruptions
or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services;
natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and the
factors identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Caution should be
taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger’s forward-looking statements and
Grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.


Item
7A:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Grainger is exposed
to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions, assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.  For 2009, a uniform
10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect
Grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a $0.9 million decrease
in net earnings. Comparatively, in 2008 a uniform 10% strengthening of the U.S.
dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect Grainger and its joint
ventures would have resulted in a $2.6 million decrease in net earnings. A
uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $1.1 million
increase in net earnings for 2009, as compared with an increase in net earnings
of $3.1 million for 2008. This sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales
levels or local currency prices or costs. Grainger does not hold derivatives for
trading purposes.

Grainger is also
exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio. During 2009 and 2008, all
of its long-term debt was variable rate debt. A 1 percentage point increase in
interest rates paid by Grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net
earnings of approximately $3.3 million for 2009 and $2.5 million for
2008.  A 1 percentage point decrease in interest rates would have
resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately $3.3 million for 2009
and $2.5 million for 2008. This sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes
in interest rates on long-term debt does not factor in potential changes in
long-term debt levels.

Grainger has limited
primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale, but
does not purchase commodities directly.

MANAGEMENT’S
ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of
W.W. Grainger, Inc. (Grainger) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Grainger’s internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Grainger’s management and
Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements under all potential conditions. Therefore, effective
internal control over financial reporting provides only reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance with respect to the preparation and presentation of
financial statements.

Grainger’s
management assessed the effectiveness of Grainger’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the framework set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework.

Based
on its assessment under that framework and the criteria established therein,
Grainger’s management concluded that Grainger’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.

Ernst & Young
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited Grainger’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, as stated in
their report which is included herein.


REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of
Directors and Shareholders

W.W. Grainger,
Inc.

We have audited W.W.
Grainger, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). W.W Grainger, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, W.W. Grainger, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the
COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2009 of W.W. Grainger, Inc., and our report dated February
25, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

W.W. Grainger,
Inc.

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of W.W Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, and the related consolidated statements
of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of W.W. Grainger, Inc. and subsidiaries at
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

As described in Note
16 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the
Company changed its method of accounting for uncertain tax positions to conform
with ASC 740.

As described in Note
17 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2009, the
Company changed its method of computing earnings per share to the two-class
method from the treasury stock method to conform with ASC 260.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), W.W. Grainger, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2010,
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

W.W.
Grainger, Inc. and Subsidiaries

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007

NOTE
1 – BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

INDUSTRY
INFORMATION

W.W. Grainger, Inc.
is the leading broad-line supplier of facilities maintenance and other related
products and services in North America, with operations primarily in the United
States, Canada, Japan and Mexico.  In this report, the words “Company”
or “Grainger” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

PRINCIPLES OF
CONSOLIDATION

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from the
consolidated financial statements.

INVESTMENTS IN
UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

For
investments in which the Company owns or controls from 20% to 50% of the voting
shares, the equity method of accounting is used. Changes in interest arising
from the issuance of stock by an investee are accounted for as additional
contributed capital. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

MANAGEMENT
ESTIMATES

In
preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
TRANSLATION

The
financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using
the local currency as the functional currency. Net exchange gains or losses
resulting from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations and
related long-term debt are recorded as a separate component of other
comprehensive earnings. See Notes 2 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events through February 25, 2010, the date the
financial statements were issued.

NOTE
2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

REVENUE
RECOGNITION

Revenues recognized
include product sales, billings for freight and handling charges and fees earned
for services provided. The Company recognizes product sales and billings for
freight and handling charges primarily on the date products are shipped to, or
picked up by, the customer. The Company’s standard shipping terms are FOB
shipping point. On occasion, the Company will negotiate FOB destination terms.
These sales are recognized upon delivery to the customer. Fee revenues, which
account for less than 1% of total revenues, are recognized after services are
completed.

COST OF MERCHANDISE
SOLD

Cost of merchandise
sold includes product and product-related costs, vendor consideration,
freight-out and handling costs. The Company defines handling costs as those
costs incurred to fulfill a shipped sales order.

VENDOR
CONSIDERATION

The
Company receives rebates and allowances from its vendors to promote their
products. The Company utilizes numerous advertising programs to promote its
vendors’ products, including catalogs and other printed media, Internet and
other marketing programs. Most of these programs relate to multiple vendors,
which makes supporting the specific, identifiable and incremental criteria
difficult, and would require numerous assumptions and judgments. Based on the
inexact nature of trying to track reimbursements to the exact advertising
expenditure for each vendor, the Company treats most vendor advertising
allowances as a reduction of Cost of merchandise sold rather than a reduction of
operating (advertising) expenses. Rebates earned from vendors that are based on
product purchases are capitalized into inventory as part of product purchase
price. These rebates are credited to cost of merchandise sold based on sales.
Vendor rebates that are earned based on products sold are credited directly to
Cost of merchandise sold.

ADVERTISING

Advertising costs
are expensed in the year the related advertisement is first presented.
Advertising expense was $114.6 million, $120.7 million and $122.4 million for
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Most vendor-provided allowances are
classified as an offset to Cost of merchandise sold. For additional information
see VENDOR CONSIDERATION above.


Catalog expense is
amortized equally over the life of the catalog, beginning in the month of its
distribution. Advertising costs for catalogs that have not been distributed by
year-end are capitalized as Prepaid expenses. Amounts included in Prepaid
expenses at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $48.1 million, $39.5 million,
and $32.1 million, respectively.

WAREHOUSING,
MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Included in this
category are purchasing, branch operations, information services, and marketing
and selling expenses, as well as other types of general and administrative
costs.

STOCK INCENTIVE
PLANS

The
Company measures all share-based payments using fair-value-based methods and
records compensation expense related to these payments over the vesting period.
See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

INCOME
TAXES

Income taxes are
recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the determination of
financial statement income, with deferred taxes being provided for temporary
differences between financial and tax reporting.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE
EARNINGS (LOSSES)

The
Company’s Other comprehensive earnings (losses) include foreign currency
translation adjustments and unrecognized gains (losses) on postretirement and
other employment-related benefit plans. See Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

CASH AND MARKETABLE
SECURITIES

The
Company considers investments in highly liquid debt instruments, purchased with
an original maturity of ninety days or less, to be cash equivalents. For cash
equivalents, the carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short
maturity of these instruments.

The
Company’s investments in marketable securities consist of commercial paper to be
held to maturity. These investments have an original maturity date of more than
90 days. The investments are issued from high credit quality issuers. The
marketable securities are recorded at cost, which approximates fair
value.

CONCENTRATION OF
CREDIT RISK

The
Company places temporary cash investments with institutions of high credit
quality and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
institution.

The
Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries doing
business in all regions of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, India,
Japan, and China. Consequently, no significant concentration of credit risk is
considered to exist.

ALLOWANCE FOR
DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

The
Company establishes reserves for customer accounts that are potentially
uncollectible. The method used to estimate the allowances is based on several
factors, including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual
write-offs to the age of the receivables. These analyses also take into
consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific
industry, group of customers or a specific customer.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are
valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined primarily by the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, which accounts for approximately 74% of total
inventory. For the remaining inventory, cost is determined by the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method.

PROPERTY, BUILDINGS
AND EQUIPMENT

Property, buildings
and equipment are valued at cost. For financial statement purposes, depreciation
and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of
depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives, principally
on the declining-balance and sum-of-the-years-digits methods. The principal
estimated useful lives for determining depreciation are as follows:

Buildings,
      structures and improvements

10 to 30
      years

Furniture,
      fixtures, machinery and equipment

      to 10 years

Improvements to
leased property are amortized over the initial terms of the respective leases or
the estimated service lives of the improvements, whichever is
shorter.

The
Company capitalized interest costs of $0.5 million, $1.3 million and $1.4
million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

LONG-LIVED
ASSETS

The
carrying value of long-lived assets is evaluated whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired. An
impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows
resulting from use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the
carrying value of the asset. Impairment is measured as the amount by which the
carrying amount exceeds the fair value.


During 2009, the
Company recognized impairment charges of $9.0 million included in Warehousing,
marketing and administrative expenses, to reduce the carrying value of certain
long-lived assets to their estimated fair value pursuant to impairment
indicators for property currently held for sale, lease terminations, idle
assets, and branch closures.

GOODWILL AND OTHER
INTANGIBLES

Goodwill is
recognized as the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net amount assigned
to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but
rather tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances
require. Impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of
goodwill is less than its carrying value.

The
Company recognizes an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the
intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it can be
separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed,
rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related
contract, asset or liability. Such intangibles are amortized over their
estimated useful lives unless the estimated useful life is determined to be
indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives
of one to 20 years. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of
an intangible, subject to amortization, is not recoverable from expected future
cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

The
Company also maintains intangible assets with indefinite lives, which are not
amortized. These intangibles are tested for impairment on an annual basis and
more often if circumstances require. Impairment losses are recognized whenever
the implied fair value of these assets is less than their carrying
value.

FAIR VALUE OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial
instruments.  The carrying value of long-term debt also approximates
fair value due to the variable interest rates that are tied to
LIBOR.

INSURANCE
RESERVES

The
Company purchases insurance for catastrophic exposures and those risks required
to be insured by law. It also retains a significant portion of the risk of
certain losses related to workers’ compensation, general liability and property
losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self-insured retentions.
Reserves for these potential losses are based on an external analysis of the
Company’s historical claims results and other actuarial
assumptions.

WARRANTY
RESERVES

The
Company generally warrants the products it sells against defects for one year.
For a significant portion of warranty claims, the manufacturer of the product is
responsible for expenses. For warranty expenses not covered by the manufacturer,
the Company provides a reserve for future costs based primarily on historical
experience. The reserve activity was as follows (in thousands of
dollars):

NEW
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In December 2008,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance
regarding employer’s disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets,
codified primarily in ASC 715.  ASC 715 requires expanded disclosures
about investment policies and strategies for the plan assets of a defined
benefit pension or other postretirement plan, including information regarding
major categories of assets, input and valuation techniques used to measure the
fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within the
plans.  The Company has applied the provision of ASC 715 and the
adoption did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations
or financial position.

In
May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding subsequent events,
codified primarily in ASC 855, which provides authoritative accounting guidance
for subsequent events.  ASC 855 addresses events that occur after the
balance sheet date but before the issuance of the financial
statements.  It distinguishes between subsequent events that should be
recognized in the financial statements and those that should
not.  Also, it requires disclosure of the date through which
subsequent events were evaluated and disclosures for certain non-recognized
events.  ASC 855 was effective on a prospective basis for interim or
annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009.  The Company has
applied the provision of ASC 855 and disclosed the date through which it has
evaluated subsequent events and the basis for choosing that date.  The
adoption of ASC 855 did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of
operations or financial position.


In
June 2009, the FASB issued “The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the
Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,” codified in ASC 105,
which established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of
authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to be applied by
non-governmental entities.  The Accounting Standards Codification
superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting
standards.  ASC 105 was effective for interim or annual financial
periods ending after September 15, 2009.  The Company has applied this
statement and the adoption did not have a material effect on its results of
operations or financial position.

NOTE
3 – BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

During 2009, the
Company acquired three companies for approximately $134 million, less cash
acquired.  The total cost of the acquisitions has been allocated to
the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair
values at the respective dates of acquisition.  The estimated purchase
price allocations are preliminary and subject to revisions based on additional
valuation work related to intangibles.  Purchased identifiable
intangible assets totalled approximately $49 million and will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over a weighted average life of 15 years (lives ranging from
one to 20 years).  Acquired intangibles primarily consist of product
line copyrights, proprietary software, customer relationships and trade
names.  The Company recorded approximately $108 million of goodwill
and other intangibles associated with these acquisitions.  The
goodwill is partially deductible for tax purposes.

In
September 2009, the Company acquired 380,000 common shares of MonotaRO Co., Ltd.
(MonotaRO) for approximately $4 million increasing its interest from 48 percent
to 53 percent.  As a result of the Company obtaining controlling
voting interest over MonotaRO, the Company consolidated MonotaRO’s balance sheet
as of September 30, 2009.  MonotaRO’s earnings are reported on a one
month lag which began in October 2009.  The Company previously
accounted for its 48 percent interest in MonotaRO as an equity method
investment.  Upon obtaining the controlling interest, the previously
held equity interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a pre-tax gain
of $47 million ($28 million after tax) reported as other income in the Company’s
consolidated statement of earnings.  The gain includes $3 million
reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive earnings.  Both the
gain on the previously held equity investment and the fair value of the
noncontrolling interest in MonotaRO of $61 million were based on the closing
market price of MonotaRO’s common stock on the acquisition date.  The
Company has recorded separately identifiable intangible assets totalling $66
million.  The amortizable intangibles primarily consist of customer
relationships which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 15
years.  The indefinite-lived intangible ($32 million) is related to
the MonotaRO trade name. The estimated purchase price allocations are
preliminary and subject to revisions based on additional valuation work of
intangibles.  The goodwill recognized in the transaction amounted to
approximately $58 million and is not deductible for tax purposes.

In
June 2009, the Company acquired the remaining 50.1% of its joint venture in
India, Grainger Industrial Supply India Private Limited, formerly known as Asia
Pacific Brands India Private Limited, for $1 million.  See Note 6 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this
acquisition.

During 2008, the
Company acquired two companies for approximately $34 million and during 2007,
the Company acquired one company for approximately $5 million.

The
results of these acquisitions are included in the Company’s consolidated results
from the respective dates of acquisition. Due to the immaterial nature of these
transactions, both individually and in the aggregate, disclosures of amounts
assigned to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and pro forma results of
operations were not considered necessary.

5 – INVENTORIES

Inventories
primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale.  Inventories
would have been $333.3 million, $317.0 million and $287.7 million higher than
reported at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, if the FIFO method
of inventory accounting had been used for all Company inventories. Net earnings
would have increased by $10.0 million, $18.1 million and $10.8 million for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, using the FIFO
method of accounting. Inventory values using the FIFO method of accounting
approximate replacement cost.


NOTE
6 – INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

The
table below summarizes the activity in the investments in unconsolidated
entities (in thousands of dollars):

In
September 2009, the Company acquired 380,000 common shares of MonotaRO Co., Ltd.
(MonotaRO) for approximately $4 million, increasing its interest from 48 percent
to 53 percent.  The results of MonotaRO are now included in the
Company’s consolidated results from the date of obtaining a controlling voting
interest.  The Company previously accounted for its 48 percent
interest in MonotaRO as an equity method investment.  Upon obtaining
the controlling interest, the previously held equity interest was remeasured to
fair value, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $47 million ($28 million after-tax)
reported in the Company’s consolidated statement of earnings.  The
gain includes $3 million reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive
earnings.

In
July 2008, the Company acquired a 49.9% interest in Grainger Industrial Supply
India Private Limited (Grainger India), formerly known as Asia Pacific Brands
India Private Limited, from its sole shareholder for $5.4 million.  In
addition, the Company and the joint venture partner each made a $1.1 million
capital infusion intended to help grow the business.  In the fourth
quarter 2008, the Company wrote-off its investment due to the economic slowdown
in India and the loss of a major supplier that accounted for approximately 25%
of the joint venture’s annual revenue. These conditions severely affected
Grainger India’s ability to secure additional financing to meet its current
obligations and continue as a going concern. The Company accounted for this
investment using the equity method until it was written-off.  During
2009, Grainger India’s business improved.  It was able to streamline
its operations, strengthen its management and enhance its supplier
base.  As a result, the Company acquired the remaining 50.1% of this
joint venture in June 2009 for $1.2 million.  The results of Grainger
India are now included in the Company’s consolidated results from the date of
acquisition.

In
2007, the Company and the other business partner in the joint venture agreed to
significantly change the business model and fund the expansion of MRO Korea Co.,
Ltd., which was previously written-off. The Company contributed $2.1 million to
MRO Korea Co., Ltd., maintaining its 49% ownership, and resumed the equity
method of accounting. In conjunction with the reinstatement of the equity
accounting method, a credit was recorded to retained earnings for $1.4 million,
which represented the accumulated unrecognized equity earnings during the period
the equity method was suspended.

NOTE
7 – CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

Amortization of
capitalized software is on a straight-line basis over three and five years.
Amortization begins when the software is available for its intended use.
Amortization expense was $22.7 million, $22.7 million and $21.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company reviews
the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable.

NOTE
10 – EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Retirement
Plans

A
majority of the Company’s employees are covered by a noncontributory profit
sharing plan.  This plan provides for annual employer contributions
generally based upon a formula related primarily to earnings before federal
income taxes, limited to a percentage of the total eligible compensation paid to
all eligible employees. The plan was amended in 2008, to establish a minimum
contribution of 8% and a maximum contribution of 18% of total eligible
compensation paid to eligible employees.  Prior to 2008, there was no
minimum percentage and the maximum percentage was 25%.  The Company
also sponsors additional defined contribution plans, which cover most of the
other employees. Provisions under all plans were $128.1 million, $145.4 million,
and $130.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Postretirement
Benefits

The
Company has a postretirement healthcare benefits plan that provides coverage for
a majority of its employees and their dependents should they elect to maintain
such coverage upon retirement. Covered employees become eligible for
participation when they qualify for retirement while working for the Company.
Participation in the plan is voluntary and requires participants to make
contributions toward the cost of the plan, as determined by the
Company.

The
Company’s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and net periodic
benefit costs include the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the
“Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (the
Medicare Act). The Medicare Act provides a federal subsidy to retiree healthcare
benefit plan sponsors that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least
actuarially equivalent to that provided by Medicare. As a result of the subsidy,
the APBO has been reduced by $43.0 million, $45.4 million and $40.4 million as
of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The subsidy has reduced net
periodic benefits costs by approximately $4.7 million, $5.2 million and
$6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

The
net periodic benefits costs charged to operating expenses, which were valued
with a measurement date of January 1 for each year, consisted of the following

The
benefit obligation was determined by applying the terms of the plan and
actuarial models.  These models include various actuarial assumptions,
including discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare
cost trend rates. The actuarial assumptions also anticipate future cost-sharing
changes to retiree contributions that will maintain the current cost-sharing
ratio between the Company and the retirees. The Company evaluates its actuarial
assumptions on an annual basis and considers changes in these long-term factors
based upon market conditions and historical experience.

Effective January 1,
2010 (reflected in the 2009 valuation above), the plan was amended to extend its
benefits to an additional group of employees and also include an in-network
deductible, and increased out-of-pocket maximums and hospital co-payments. The
plan amendment effective January 1, 2008 (reflected in the 2007 valuation above)
changed the out-of-pocket maximums, co-payments and coinsurance amounts for
retirees.


The
following assumptions were used to determine net periodic benefit costs at

The
discount rate assumptions reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed
income debt instruments. These rates have been selected due to their similarity
to the projected cash flows of the postretirement healthcare benefit
plan.

The
Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs
to determine the healthcare cost trend rates. Assumed healthcare cost trend
rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare
plans. A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would
have the following effects on December 31, 2009 results (in thousands of
dollars):

The
Company has established a Group Benefit Trust to fund the plan and process
benefit payments. The assets of the Trust are invested entirely in funds
designed to track the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500). This
investment strategy reflects the long-term nature of the plan obligation and
seeks to take advantage of the earnings potential of equity
securities.  The plan’s assets are stated at fair value which
represents the net asset value of shares held by the plan in the registered
investment companies at year-end.  The following table sets forth by
level within the fair value hierarchy the plan investment assets at the quoted
market price (the level 1 input) as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands of

The
Company uses the long-term historical return on the plan assets and the
historical performance of the S&P 500 to develop its expected return on plan
assets. The required use of an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
may result in recognizing income that is greater or less than the actual return
on plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term
returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns and, therefore,
result in a pattern of income recognition that more closely matches the pattern
of the services provided by the employees.

The
Company’s policies include periodic reviews by management and trustees at least
annually concerning: (1) the allocation of assets among various asset classes
(e.g., domestic stocks, international stocks, short-term bonds, long-term bonds,
etc.); (2) the investment performance of the assets, including performance
comparisons with appropriate benchmarks; (3) investment guidelines and other
matters of investment policy; and (4) the hiring, dismissal, or retention of
investment managers.


The
funding of the trust is an estimated amount which is intended to allow the
maximum deductible contribution under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC),
as amended, and was $9.0 million, $9.4 million and $6.4 million for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. There are no minimum
funding requirements and the Company intends to follow its practice of funding
the maximum deductible contribution under the IRC.

Company forecasts the following benefit payments (which include a projection for
expected future employee service) and subsidy receipts (in thousands of

Executive
Death Benefit Plan

The
Executive Death Benefit Plan provides one of three potential benefits: a
supplemental income benefit (SIB), an executive death benefit (EDB) or a
postretirement payment. The SIB provides income continuation at 50% of total
compensation, payable for ten years to the beneficiary of a participant if that
participant dies while employed by the Company. Alternatively, the EDB provides
an after-tax lump sum payment of one times final total compensation to the
beneficiary of a participant who dies after retirement. In addition, a
participant may elect to receive a reduced postretirement payment instead of the
EDB. In 2008, new participants to the plan were not eligible for the reduced
postretirement payment option. Effective January 1, 2010, there will be no new
participants added to the plan. There are no plan assets. Benefits are paid as
they come due from the general assets of the Company.

The
net periodic benefits costs charged to operating expenses, which were valued

Deferred
Compensation Plans

The
Executive Deferred Compensation plans are money purchase defined benefit plans.
Plan participation was limited to Company executives during the years 1984 to
1986 and no new executives have been added since that time. Participants were
allowed to defer a portion of their compensation for the years 1984 through
1990. In return, under the plan, each participant receives an individually
specified benefit at age 65. Benefits are reduced when the participant
elects early retirement. There are no plan assets. Benefits are paid as they
come due from the general assets of the Company.

The
net periodic benefits costs charged to operating expenses, which were valued

Certain of the
Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries provide limited non-pension benefits to retirees
in addition to government-mandated programs. The cost of these programs is not
significant to the Company. Most retirees outside the United States are covered
by government-sponsored and -administered programs.

NOTE
11 – LEASES

The
Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under noncancellable
operating leases that expire at various dates through 2036. The Company
capitalizes all significant leases that qualify for capitalization, of which
there were none at December 31, 2009. Many of the building leases obligate the
Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance and certain maintenance costs, and
contain multiple renewal provisions, exercisable at the Company’s option. Leases
that contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rentals are
recognized in rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Cash
or rent abatements received upon entering into certain operating leases are also
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

At
December 31, 2009, the approximate future minimum lease payments for all
operating leases were as follows (in thousands of dollars):

respectively. These amounts are net of sublease income of $0.7 million, $0.6
million and $0.5 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.


NOTE
12 – STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

The
Company maintains stock incentive plans under which the Company may grant a
variety of incentive awards to employees and directors. Shares of common stock
were authorized for issuance under the plans in connection with awards of
non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. As of December 31, 2009,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, stock units and
non-qualified stock options have been granted.

In
2005, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2005 Incentive
Plan (“Plan”), which replaced all prior active plans (“Prior Plans”).
Awards previously granted under Prior Plans will remain outstanding in
accordance with their terms.  A total of 9.5 million shares of common
stock have been reserved for issuance under the Plan. As of December 31, 2009,
there were 1,086,221 shares available for grant under the Plan.

Pre-tax stock-based
compensation expense was $40.7 million, $46.1 million, and $35.7 million in
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Related income tax benefits
recognized in earnings were $14.1 million, $18.2 million and $11.8 million in
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Options

In
2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company issued stock option grants to employees as part
of their incentive compensation. Stock option grants were 763,370, 721,600 and
578,120 for the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In
2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company provided broad-based stock option grants
covering 181,100, 161,400 and 162,100 shares, respectively, to those employees
who reached major service milestones and were not participants in other stock
option programs.

Option awards are
granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the
Company’s stock on the last trading day preceding the date of grant. The options
generally vest over three years, although accelerated vesting is provided in
certain circumstances. Awards generally expire ten years from the grant
date.

The
Company uses a binomial lattice option pricing model for the valuation of stock
options. The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2009, 2008 and
2007 was $19.32, $20.82 and $22.92, respectively. The fair value of each option
granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007 used the following assumptions:

The
risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected
term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted
during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are
expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holder exercise
and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and
historical volatility of the closing price of the Company’s stock over a period
equal to the expected life of each option grant. Historical company information
is also the primary basis for selection of expected dividend yield
assumptions.

Performance
Shares

The
Company awarded performance-based shares to certain executives. Receipt of
Company stock is contingent upon the Company meeting sales growth and return on
invested capital (ROIC) performance goals. Each participant is granted a base
number of shares. At the end of the performance period, the number of shares
granted will be increased, decreased or remain the same based upon actual
Company-wide sales growth versus target sales growth. The shares, as determined
at the end of the performance year, are issued at the end of the third year if
the Company’s average target ROIC is achieved during the vesting
period.

Performance share
value is based upon closing market prices on the last trading day preceding the
date of award and is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the three
year period. Holders of the 2008 and 2007 performance share awards are entitled
to receive cash payments equivalent to cash dividends after the end of the first
year performance period, whereas holders of the 2009 and subsequent performance
share awards are not entitled to receive cash payments equivalent to cash
dividends.  If the performance shares vest, they will be settled by
the issuance of Company common stock in exchange for the performance shares on a
one-for-one basis.

awards:

a weighted average period of 1.7 years.

Restricted
Stock

The
plans authorize the granting of restricted stock, which is held by the Company
pursuant to the terms and conditions related to the applicable grants. Except
for the right of disposal, holders of restricted stock have full shareholders’
rights during the period of restriction, including voting rights and the right
to receive dividends. Restricted stock grants have original vesting periods of
six to ten years.

Compensation expense
related to restricted stock awards is based upon the closing market price on the
last trading day preceding the date of grant and is charged to earnings on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. The following table summarizes the

Stock Units (RSUs)

Awards of RSUs are

from two to seven years from issuance, although accelerated vesting is provided
in certain instances. Holders of RSUs are entitled to receive cash payments
equivalent to cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect to common
stock. At various times after vesting, RSUs will be settled by the issuance of
stock evidencing the conversion of the RSUs into shares of the Company common
stock on a one-for-one basis. Compensation expense related to RSUs is based upon
the closing market prices on the last trading day preceding the date of award
and is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period.

Director
Stock Awards

The
Company provides members of the Board of Directors with deferred stock unit
grants. A stock unit is the economic equivalent of a share of common stock.
Beginning in April 2008, the number of units covered by each grant is equal to
$100,000 divided by the fair market value of a share of common stock at the time
of the grant, rounded up to the next ten-unit increment. Prior to April 2008,
the number of units covered by each grant was equal to $60,000 divided by the
fair market value of a share of common stock at the time of the grant, rounded
up to the next ten-unit increment. The Company also awards stock units in
connection with elective deferrals of director fees and dividend equivalents
on


existing stock
units. Deferred fees and dividend equivalents on existing stock units are
converted into stock units on the basis of the market value of the stock at the
relevant times. Payment of the value of stock units is scheduled to be made
after termination of service as a director. As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, there were eleven nonemployee directors who held stock units.

The
Company recognizes (income) expense for the change in value of equivalent stock
units. The following table summarizes activity for stock units related to
deferred director fees (dollars in thousands):

agreement (ASR) with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Goldman) to purchase $500
million of its outstanding common stock. The Company paid Goldman $500 million
on August 23, 2007, in exchange for an initial delivery of 5,316,007 shares. The
ASR was treated as an equity transaction. At settlement, the Company was to
receive or pay additional shares of its common stock or cash (at Grainger’s
option), based upon the volume weighted average price during the term of the
agreement.  Accordingly, on January 4, 2008, the Company received
415,274 shares of its common stock from Goldman as final settlement of the ASR.
A total of 5,731,281 shares were repurchased under the ASR.

Foreign currency
translation adjustments result from the translation of assets and liabilities of
foreign subsidiaries. The increase in foreign currency translation adjustments
in 2009 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the
Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.  In 2008, foreign currency
translation adjustments decreased primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar versus these same currencies.

The
decrease in unrecognized losses related to the postretirement benefit
plan in 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate and an
increase in the return on plan assets, offset by changes in other actuarial
assumptions. The increase in unrecognized losses in 2008 was primarily due to
the impact of a reduction in discount rates and losses on plan
assets.

tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements
or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse.

At
December 31, 2009, the Company had $44.8 million of operating loss carryforwards
related primarily to foreign operations, some of which begin to expire in 2010.
The valuation allowance represents a provision for uncertainty as
to


the
realization of the tax benefits of these carryforwards. In addition, the Company
recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax
assets that may not be realized.

The
changes in the valuation allowance were as follows (in thousands of

Undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2009, amounted to $59.2
million. No provision for deferred U.S. income taxes has been made for these
subsidiaries because the Company intends to permanently reinvest such earnings
in those foreign operations.

On
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740. As a result, the
Company recognized a decrease of approximately $0.9 million in the liability for
tax uncertainties, which resulted in an increase to the January 1, 2007, balance
of Retained earnings.

The
changes in the liability for tax uncertainties, excluding interest, are as
follows (in thousands of dollars):

The
Company classifies the liability for tax uncertainties in Deferred income taxes
and tax uncertainties. Included in this amount are $8.1 million, $7.4 million
and $3.3 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of tax
positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which
there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Any changes in the
timing of deductibility of these items would not affect the annual effective tax
rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authorities to an
earlier period.

The
Company regularly undergoes examination of its federal income tax returns by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Tax years through 2005 are
closed.  Although the Company is not currently under examination by
the IRS nor under notice of a pending examination, a recently acquired
subsidiary is under examination for tax year 2008. The Company is also subject
to state and local income tax audits and foreign jurisdiction tax audits. The
Company’s tax years 2002 – 2009 remain subject to state and local audits. Tax
years 2004 – 2009 remain open to foreign audits. Two of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries are currently under audit.  The estimated amount of
liability associated with the Company’s uncertain tax positions may decrease
within the next twelve months due to expiring statutes, tax payments or audit
activity.

The
Company recognizes interest expense in the provision for income taxes. During
2009, the Company recognized a benefit of $0.5 million for
interest.  During 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized interest of
$0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively, the Company accrued $1.4 million, $1.9 million and $1.1
million for interest.


NOTE
17 – EARNINGS PER SHARE

In
June 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which states that unvested
share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or
dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and
shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the
two-class method.

Effective January 1,
2009, the Company adopted the authoritative guidance.  The Company’s
unvested share-based payment awards, such as certain Performance Shares,
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that contain nonforfeitable rights
to dividends, meet the criteria of a participating security.  The
adoption has changed the methodology of computing the Company’s earnings per
share to the two-class method from the treasury stock method.  As a
result, the Company has restated previously reported earnings per
share.  This change has not affected previously reported consolidated
net earnings or net cash flows from operations.  Under the two-class
method, earnings are allocated between common stock and participating
securities.  Under the authoritative guidance the presentation of
basic and diluted earnings per share is required only for each class of common
stock and not for participating securities.  As such, the Company will
present basic and diluted earnings per share for its one class of common
stock.

The
two-class method includes an earnings allocation formula that determines
earnings per share for each class of common stock according to dividends
declared and undistributed earnings for the period.  The Company’s
reported net earnings is reduced by the amount allocated to participating
securities to arrive at the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders for
purposes of calculating earnings per share.

The
dilutive effect of participating securities is calculated using the more
dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method.  The Company
has determined the two-class method to be the more dilutive.  As such,
the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders in the basic earnings per
share calculation is adjusted for the reallocation of undistributed earnings to
participating securities as prescribed by the authoritative guidance to arrive
at the earnings allocated to common stock shareholders for calculating the
diluted earnings per share.

The
Company had additional outstanding stock options of 2.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2008 that were excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the common stock.

The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
share under the two-class method (in thousands of dollars, except for share and
per share amounts):

NOTE
18 – SEGMENT INFORMATION

Effective January 1,
2009, the Company revised its segment disclosure.  The Company has two
reportable segments:  the United States and Canada.  In the
first quarter of 2009, the Company integrated the Lab Safety Supply business
into the Grainger Industrial Supply business and results are now reported under
the United States segment.  The Canada segment reflects the results
for Acklands – Grainger Inc., the Company’s Canadian branch-based distribution
business.  Other Businesses include the following:  MonotaRO
Co., Ltd. (Japan), Grainger, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico), Grainger Industrial Supply
India Private Limited (India), Grainger Caribe Inc. (Puerto Rico), Grainger
China LLC (China) and Grainger Panama S.A. (Panama).  These businesses
generate revenue through the distribution of facilities maintenance
products.  Prior year segment amounts have been restated in a
consistent manner.

The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. Intersegment transfer prices are
established at external selling prices, less costs not incurred due to a related
party sale.

NOTE
20 – CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS

The
Company has been named, along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies, as a
defendant in litigation in various states involving asbestos and/or silica.
These lawsuits typically assert claims of personal injury arising from alleged
exposure to asbestos and/or silica as a consequence of products purportedly
distributed by the Company. As of February 2, 2010, the Company is named in
cases filed on behalf of approximately 1,900 plaintiffs in which there is an
allegation of exposure to asbestos and/or silica.  The Company has
denied, or intends to deny, the allegations in all of the above-described
lawsuits.

In
2009, lawsuits relating to asbestos and/or silica and involving approximately
470 plaintiffs were dismissed with respect to the Company, typically based on
the lack of product identification. If a specific product distributed by the
Company is identified in any of these lawsuits, The Company would attempt to
exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer. In addition,
the Company believes that a substantial number of these claims are covered by
insurance.  The Company has entered agreements with its major
insurance carriers relating to the scope, coverage and costs of
defense.  While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these
lawsuits, it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

The
Company is a party to a contract with the United States General Services
Administration (the “GSA”) first entered into in 1999 and subsequently extended
in 2004.  The GSA contract had been the subject of an audit performed
by the GSA’s Office of the Inspector General.  In December 2007, the
Company received a letter from the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Civil
Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) regarding the GSA contract.
The letter suggested that the Company had not complied with its disclosure
obligations and the contract’s pricing provisions, and had potentially
overcharged government customers under the contract.

Discussions relating
to the Company’s compliance with its disclosure obligations and the contract’s
pricing provisions are ongoing.  The timing and outcome of these
discussions are uncertain and could include settlement or civil litigation by
the DOJ to recover, among other amounts, treble damages and penalties under the
False Claims Act.  While this matter is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, an unfavorable
resolution could result in significant payments by the Company.  The
Company continues to believe that it has complied with the GSA contract in all
material respects.

The
Company is a party to a contract with the United States Postal Service (the
“USPS”) entered into in 2003 covering the sale of certain Maintenance Repair and
Operating Supplies (the “MRO Contract”).  The Company received a
subpoena dated August 29, 2008, from the USPS Office of Inspector General
seeking information about the Company’s pricing compliance under the MRO
Contract.  The Company has provided responsive information to the USPS
but no substantive discussions have yet begun.

The
Company is also a party to a contract with the USPS entered into in 2001
covering the sale of certain janitorial and custodial items (the “Custodial
Contract”).  The Company received a subpoena dated June 30, 2009, from
the USPS Office of Inspector General seeking information about the Company’s
pricing practices and compliance under the Custodial Contract.  The
Company has provided responsive information to the USPS but no substantive
discussions have yet begun.

The
timing and outcome of the USPS investigations of the MRO Contract and the
Custodial Contract are uncertain and could include settlement or civil
litigation by the USPS to recover, among other amounts treble damages and
penalties under the False Claims Act.  While these matters are not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position,
an unfavorable resolution could result in significant payments by the
Company.  The Company continues to believe that it has complied with
each of the MRO Contract and the Custodial Contract in all material
respects.

In
addition to the foregoing, from time to time the Company is involved in various
other legal and administrative proceedings that are incidental to its business,
including claims relating to product liability, premises liability, general
negligence, environmental issues, employment, intellectual property and other
matters. As a government contractor selling to Federal, state and local
governmental entities, the Company is also subject to governmental or regulatory
inquiries or audits or other proceedings, including those related to pricing
compliance. It is not expected that the ultimate resolution of any of these
matters will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
