PART I

Item 1: Business

The Company

The registrant, W.W. Grainger, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Illinois 
in 1928. It is a leading nationwide distributor of maintenance, repair, and
operating (MRO) supplies and related information to commercial, industrial, 
contractor, and institutional customers and regards itself as a service 
business. As used herein, "Company" means W.W. Grainger, Inc. and/or its 
subsidiaries as the context may require.

During 1994, in conjunction with the integration of certain business units, 
the Company began a process of integrating its Corporate headquarters 
and core branch-based business support functions. These support 
functions provide coordination and guidance to all business units in the 
areas of Accounting, Administrative Services, Aviation, Communications, 
Compensation and Benefits, Data Systems and Data Processing, Finance, 
Government Regulations, Human Resources, Industrial Relations, 
Insurance and Risk Management, Internal Audit, Legal, Planning, Real 
Estate and Construction Services, Security and Safety, Taxes, Training and 
Development, and Treasury Services.

The Company utilizes a satellite communications network which substantially
reduces its reliance on phone lines by linking branches and other facilities
together via a network control center. This results in almost instantaneous 
transmittal of information, which expedites the completion of sales 
transactions and the initiation of stock replenishment.

During 1994, the Company began a program to upgrade branch computer 
systems. The new systems, upon final installation in 1995, will have the 
capacity to accept enhancements to the Company's order processing 
capabilities. This will result in greater efficiency and accuracy in handling 
orders from large customers which often require special information or 
handling. During 1994, an average of 88,700 sales transactions were completed
daily. The Company does not engage in basic or substantive product research
and development activity. New items are added regularly to its product line
on the basis of market research as well as recommendations of its employees,
customers, and suppliers. Before being added, a new item must satisfy many
evaluation tests and other rigid requirements.

Grainger

The Company's core branch-based business, Grainger, is a nationwide 
distributor of air compressors, air conditioning and refrigeration equipment 
and components, air tools and paint spraying equipment, blowers, 
computer supplies, electric motors, fans, gas engine driven power plants, 
gearmotors, heating equipment and controls, hydraulic equipment, janitorial 
supplies, lighting fixtures and components, liquid pumps, material handling 
and storage equipment, motor controls, office equipment, outdoor 
equipment, plant and office maintenance equipment, power and hand tools, 
power generating plants, power transmission components, safety products, 
and shop tools, as well as other items shown in its General Catalog.

Grainger is also an important resource for both product and procurement 
process information. The Company provides technical information on 
products as well as information on historic usage of products to customers. 
Grainger Consulting Services assists companies which are reengineering 
their MRO procurement process. The Company also provides feedback to 
suppliers concerning their products.

Grainger sells principally to contractors, service shops, industrial and 
commercial maintenance departments, manufacturers, hotels, and health 
care and educational facilities. Sales in 1994 represented approximately 
20,200,000 transactions averaging $129 each and were made to more than 
1,200,000 customers. Average 1994 purchases per customer 
approximated $2,100, although average 1994 purchases per National 
Accounts customer were significantly higher. Sales to the largest single 
customer, General Electric Company, were 0.7% of sales. Grainger 
estimates that approximately 29% of 1994 sales consisted of items bearing 
the Company's registered trademarks, including "Dayton r" (principally 
electric motors and ventilation equipment), "Demco r" (power transmission 
belts), "Dem-Kote r" (spray paints), "Speedaire r" (air compressors), and 
"Teel r" (liquid pumps), as well as other trademarks. The Company has 
taken steps to protect these trademarks against infringement and believes 
that they will remain available for future use in its business. Sales of 
remaining items consisted of other well recognized brands.



Grainger purchases from more than 1,700 product suppliers most of which 
are manufacturers. The largest supplier in 1994, a diversified manufacturer 
through 25 of its divisions, accounted for 12.7% of purchases. No 
significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of 
supply.

Grainger offers its line of products at competitive prices through a 
nationwide network of branches (337 at December 31, 1994). An average 
branch has 14 employees and handles about 200 transactions per day. 
Large, computer controlled stocks of over 61,000 items maintained at three 
Regional Distribution Centers, located in the Chicago area, Greenville 
County, South Carolina, and Kansas City, Missouri, provide the branches 
and customers with protection against variable demand and delayed factory 
deliveries. Each branch tailors its inventory to local customer preferences 
and actual product demand. In 1994, Grainger invested more than 
$59,000,000 in the continuation of its branch optimization program, which 
consists of new branches, relocated branches, and additions to branches. 
During 1995, Grainger plans to transform the Chicago area RDC into a 
National Distribution Center (NDC). The NDC will be a centralized storage 
and shipment facility for slower moving inventory items, creating additional 
space to achieve increased product service levels at the other two RDCs.

In 1994, Grainger opened two additional Zone Distribution Centers (ZDCs). 
The ZDC logistics strategy provides a break-bulk function for faster branch 
stock replenishment. In addition, ZDCs handle shipped orders for their zone 
and also offer a logistical solution for integrated supply customers by 
coordinating complex orders and multiple receipts, and combining them into 
a single shipment. By eliminating order and receipt complexity from the 
branch, greater scale within the distribution system is created.

The Grainger National Accounts Program focuses on meeting the needs of 
large multi-site companies by focusing on simplifying customers' MRO 
purchasing activities and providing consistent service and pricing to each 
customer location. Sales to National Accounts customers increased 25% in 
1994 over the prior year, and National Account relationships have been 
established with over 350 of the nation's largest companies.

During 1994, Grainger began the integration of Allied Safety, Inc. into the 
core branch-based business in order to become a national full-line supplier 
of safety products. The integration, anticipated to be completed in 1995, is 
similar to the 1993 creation of Grainger Sanitary Supplies and Equipment, 
which combined elements of Jani-Serv and Ball Industries with Grainger's 
existing line of professional cleaning products. Similar integration efforts 
for Bossert Industrial Supply, Inc. (production consumable products) are 
planned to be completed in 1995.

Grainger employs sales representatives who call on existing and 
prospective customers. Sales representatives are paid a salary and 
commission. In addition, a sales force of market specialists and national 
account specialists has been developed to serve individualized markets 
and national accounts. These specialists are paid a salary only. Grainger 
employed 1,408 sales representatives, market specialists and national 
account specialists at December 31, 1994.

An important selling tool is the General Catalog, which has been published 
continuously since 1927 and has grown to 3,276 pages listing over 61,000 
items together with extensive technical and application data. For 1994, 
2,285,000 copies were published. The most current edition was issued in 
January 1995.

During 1994, Grainger continued its support of several large, multi-site 
customers by expanding product offerings. Grainger now handles an 
additional 33,000 "non-catalog" items, which includes full lines of products 
from key suppliers.

The Grainger Electronic Catalog brings directly to the customer's place of 
business a fast, easy way to select and order products. It is a state-of-the-
art system that uses PC-based software and CD-ROM technology. 
Through the Electronic Catalog, the customer can use a variety of ways to 
describe a needed product, and then review Grainger's offerings, complete 
with specifications, prices, and pictures. Other Electronic Catalog features 
include a cross-reference function that allows customers to retrieve product 
information using their own stock numbers. Enhancements for 1994 
included an improved Microsoft r Windows TM compatible version, and 
accommodations for network software. In addition, Grainger's PC-based 
tool crib management system, first introduced in 1993, can now be 
interfaced with the Grainger Electronic Catalog, allowing customers to 
benefit from the efficiencies achieved in combining these two applications. 
More than 26,000 copies of the Electronic Catalog are currently in use. The 
Electronic Catalog is also used at the branches as a training tool and a 
resource for identifying appropriate products for customers' applications.



Lab Safety Supply, Inc. (Lab Safety) and Parts Company of America (PCA)

Lab Safety, acquired in 1992, serves the safety products markets with such 
items as respiratory systems, protective clothing, and other equipment 
used in the workplace and in environmental clean-up operations. Lab 
Safety is a leading national direct marketer of safety products, serving 
350,000 customers from its facilities in Janesville, Wisconsin. The current 
Lab Safety catalog, its primary selling tool, has over 900 pages, listing 
approximately 27,000 items. During 1994, an average of 3,800 sales 
transactions were completed daily.

Parts distribution continues to expand under the PCA name. PCA 
distributes approximately 181,000 spare and replacement parts, takes 
orders 24 hours a day, 365 days per year, and ships stocked items within 
24 hours of an order, most on the same business day. PCA gives value to 
customers by being a single source for many different spare and 
replacement parts and by offering valuable technical assistance. During 
1994, an average of 2,200 sales transactions were completed daily.

Industry Segments

The Company has concluded that its business is within a single industry 
segment. For information as to the Company's consolidated revenue and 
operating earnings see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and the Results of Operations", and Item 8, "Financial 
Statements and Supplementary Data". 

The total assets of the Company for the last five years were: 1994, 
$1,534,751,000; 1993, $1,376,664,000; 1992, $1,310,538,000; 1991, 
$1,216,554,000; and 1990, $1,162,437,000.

Competition

The Company faces competition in all markets which it serves, from 
manufacturers (including some of the Company's own suppliers) that sell 
directly to certain segments of the market, from wholesale distributors, and 
from certain retail enterprises.

The principal means by which the Company competes with manufacturers 
and other distributors is by providing local stocks, efficient service, sales 
representatives, competitive prices, its several catalogs, which include 
product descriptions and in certain cases, extensive technical and 
application data, and procurement process consulting services. The 
Company believes that it can effectively compete on a price basis with its 
manufacturing competitors on small orders, but that such manufacturers 
may enjoy a cost advantage in filling large orders.

The Company serves a number of diverse markets, and is able in some 
markets to reasonably estimate the Company's competitive position within 
that market. However, taken as a whole, the Company is unable to 
determine its market shares relative to others engaged in whole or in part in 
similar activities.

Employees

As of December 31, 1994, the Company had 11,343 employees, of whom 
9,104 were full-time and 2,239 were part-time or temporary. The Company 
has never had a major work stoppage and believes that its employee 
relations are good.


Item 2: Properties

As of December 31, 1994, Grainger branch locations totaled 7,239,000 
square feet, an increase of approximately 2.5% over 1993. Most branches 
are located in or near major metropolitan areas, many in industrial parks. 
Branches range in size from 5,800 to 58,000 square feet and average 
approximately 21,000 square feet. A typical owned branch is on one floor, 
is of masonry construction, consists primarily of warehouse space, contains 
an air conditioned office and sales area, and has off the street parking for 
customers and employees. The Company considers that its properties are 
generally in good condition and well maintained, and are suitable and 
adequate to carry on the Company's business.

The significant facilities of the Company are briefly described below:

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

There are pending various legal and administrative proceedings involving 
the Company that are incidental to the business. It is not expected that the 
outcome of any such proceeding will have a material adverse effect upon 
the Company's consolidated financial position or its results of operations.



Item 4: Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth 
quarter of 1994.

Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the 
Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table, which is included as an aid to understanding changes in 
the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings, presents various items in 
the earnings statements expressed as a percentage of net sales for the years 
ended December 31, 1994, 1993, 1992, and 1991, and the percentage of increase 
(decrease) in such items in 1994, 1993, and 1992 from the prior year.

Note: Net earnings, excluding restructuring charges, as a percentage of net 
sales were 5.9% and 5.7% for 1994 and 1993, respectively. The percent of 
increase from the prior year for net earnings, excluding restructuring 
charges, was 19.3% and 8.5% for 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Net sales

The 1994 Company net sales increase of 15.0% was primarily volume related; the 
Grainger core branch-based business actually experienced selling price 
deflation of 0.6%. This increase was affected by 1994 having one more sales 
day than 1993 (on a daily basis, sales increased 14.6%). All geographic areas 
contributed to the sales growth, with the percent increases for regions east 
of the Mississippi being higher than for regions in the west. The volume 
increase primarily represented the continuing effects of Company 
market initiatives and the accelerated growth of the national economy. The 
Company's market initiatives included new product additions, pricing actions, 
the continuing effect of expanding branch and adding Zone Distribution 
facilities, and the continuing growth of the National Accounts Program. Daily 
sales to Grainger National Accounts increased 25% over 1993 levels.

The 1993 net sales increase was comprised of a 9.3% increase at Grainger and a 
22.5% increase at Allied, Bossert, Lab Safety, and PCA (Other Business Units). 
The 1993 Grainger net sales increase was comprised of a 7.4% volume increase 
and a 1.8% price increase. All geographic regions contributed to the sales 
growth, with the percent increases for regions east of the Mississippi being 
higher than for regions in the west. The volume increase was attributable to a 
combination of the Company's market initiatives, including new product 
additions, the continuing effect of expanding branch facilities, the growth of 
the National Accounts Program, and the accelerated growth in the national 
economy. The increase in sales at the Other Business Units of 22.5% was the 
result of $54,800,000 in incremental sales from an acquired business and a 
6.7% increase at existing businesses. All of the Other Business Units 
experienced sales increases except for Bossert, which had a slight sales 
decrease. Assuming the acquisition was included in both periods, the Other 
Business Units' pro forma sales would have increased by 7.9%.

Net earnings

Net earnings for 1994 were $127,874,000, net of the after tax effect of a 
restructuring charge of $49,779,000. Excluding the effect of the restructuring 
charge of $49,779,000 and the 1993 restructuring charge of $482,000, net 
earnings increased 19.3% year over year. This increase was greater than the 
sales increase primarily due to operating expenses increasing at a slower rate 
than sales, partially offset by lower gross margins. The lower than sales 
increase for operating expenses was primarily the result of leveraging payroll 
and related benefit costs, lower amortization of goodwill and other 
acquisition related costs, and lower advertising expenses, partially offset by 
increased data processing expenses related to the ongoing significant upgrade 
of the Grainger branch computer systems. Excluding restructuring charges, 
operating expenses increased 9.0% on a year over year basis. The Company's 
1994 gross margin was negatively affected by a restructuring charge of 
$16,308,000 associated with inventory write-downs.

Excluding the effect of the restructuring charge, the Company's gross margins 
decreased by 1.1 percentage points in 1994 compared with 1993. The gross 
margin decrease primarily resulted from a change in the selling price category 
mix and the level of cost increases exceeding the level of selling price 
increases. The change in the selling price category mix was primarily the 
result of increased sales to Grainger National Accounts, and by a strategic 
repricing applicable to the contractor customer segment.

The 1993 percentage increase of 8.2% was less than the increase in net sales 
primarily due to operating expenses increasing faster than sales and an 
increase in the effective income tax rate, partially offset by improved gross 
margins. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to 
increased costs at the Other Business Units and increased expenses at the 
Grainger Division. The increased costs at the Other Business Units reflect 
increased amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related costs 
principally due to the Lab Safety acquisition, increased advertising costs, 
and the Company's continuing investment in these units. The increase in 
expense at the Grainger Division was caused primarily by handling costs 
increasing due to the elimination of a transaction handling charge to 
customers on certain shipped sales and higher data processing expenses 
primarily related to new system development, partially offset by lower bad 
debt expense. The increase in the effective income tax rate was due to the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which increased the maximum 
corporate federal tax rate from 34% to 35% retroactive to January 1, 1993. The 
Company's gross margin increase was attributable to improvements at both the 
Grainger Division and at the Other Business Units. The improvement at the 
Grainger Division was due to a favorable selling price category mix and a 
favorable product mix partially offset by an unfavorable margin impact due to 
the level of cost increases exceeding the level of price increases. The 
improvement at the Other Business Units was primarily related to Lab Safety, 
which had a higher gross margin than the average for the rest of the Other 
Business Units and was included for all of 1993 versus eight months of 1992.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Working capital was $504,595,000 at December 31, 1994 compared to $442,525,000 
at December 31, 1993 and $478,784,000 at December 31, 1992. The ratio of 
current assets to current liabilities was 2.1, 2.2, and 2.5 at such dates.

Net cash flows from operations of $191,382,000 in 1994, $162,498,000 in 1993, 
and $196,368,000 in 1992 have continued to improve the Company's financial 
position and serve as the primary source of funding for capital requirements.

In each of the past three years, a portion of working capital has been used 
for additions to property, buildings, and equipment as summarized in the 
following table.

                                                1994       1993         1992

                                              --------   -------      -------
Total                                         $120,357   $98,405      $49,920
                                              ========   =======      =======

The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock during 1994. The 
Company did repurchase 1,777,000 shares in 1993, and 733,000 shares in 1992. 
Approximately 3,600,000 shares of common stock remain available for repurchase 
under the existing authorization. The Company may resume share repurchases at 
any time.

Dividends paid to shareholders were $39,570,000 in 1994, $36,272,000 in 1993, 
and $34,295,000 in 1992.

Long-term cash requirements, other than normal operating expenses, are 
anticipated for the branch optimization program, construction of Zone 
Distribution Centers, upgrading branch computer systems, and office space 
expansion. The Company's ongoing profitability continues to support these 
requirements. Internally generated funds are the primary source for working 
capital and expansion needs, supplemented by debt as the need arises. The 
Company had no material commitments outstanding at December 31, 1994.

The Company continues to maintain a low debt ratio and strong liquidity 
position, which provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and 
long-term cash requirements. Total debt as a percent of shareholders' equity 
was 4%, 7%, and 3%, at December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. 

In May 1992, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets of Lab Safety 
for $161,343,000. The acquisition was funded by short-term borrowings of 
$72,727,000, including bank borrowings aggregating $36,727,000, internal funds 
of the Company, and the assumption of $8,227,000 of long-term debt. Also 
during 1992, the Company completed its acquisition of Rice Safety Equipment 
Company for $5,906,000.

INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Inflation during the last three years has not been a significant factor to 
operations. The use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for 
inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and 
income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of 
inflation in the primary financial statements.

The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap 
between historic cost and replacement cost continues to be significant for 
these long lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with 
these assets increases significantly when adjusting for the cumulative effect 
of inflation.

The Company believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance 
the interests of investors lies in continued application of basic business 
principles, which include improving productivity, increasing working capital 
turnover, and offering products and services which can command proper price 
levels in the marketplace.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of
W.W. Grainger, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of W.W. Grainger, 
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, and the related 
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for 
the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of W.W. Grainger, 
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, and the 
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for 
the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.

We have also audited schedule II of W. W. Grainger, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992. In our opinion, this 
schedule presents fairly, in all material respects, the information required 
to be set forth therein.

                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Industry Information
The Company is a nationwide distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating 
supplies and related information to commercial, industrial, contractor, and 
institutional customers. The Company operates within a single industry segment.

Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated
from the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Changes
Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (see Note 
15) and SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other 
Than Pensions" (see Note 10). In the fourth quarter of 1993, retroactive to 
January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postemployment Benefits" (see Note 10).

Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by 
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

Property, Buildings, and Equipment
Property, buildings, and equipment are valued at cost.For financial statement 
purposes, depreciation and amortization are provided in amounts sufficient to 
relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated 
service lives, principally on the declining-balance and sum-of-the-years-
digits methods. For income tax purposes, the Company uses the maximum 
allowable accelerated methods.Improvements to leased property are being 
amortized over the initial terms of the respective leases or the estimated 
service lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.The Company 
capitalized interest costs of $1,929,000, $1,258,000, and $1,110,000 in 1994, 
1993, and 1992, respectively.

Purchased Tax Benefits 
The Company has purchased tax benefits through leases as provided by the 
Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Realized tax benefits, net of repayments, 
are included in Deferred Income Taxes.

Income Taxes
The Company uses the maximum allowable accelerated depreciation methods.
Deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the temporary differences 
between financial and tax reporting.

Purchase of Company Common Stock
Through December 31, 1993, the Company was required by its state of 
incorporation to retire any Common Stock it purchased. The excess of cost over 
par value was charged proportionately to Additional contributed capital 
and Retained earnings. Effective January 1, 1994, the Company is no longer 
required by its state of incorporation to retire Common Stock repurchases.

Earnings Per Common and Common Equivalent Share
Earnings per common and common equivalent share are computed based upon the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year which includes 
outstanding options for Common Stock, when dilutive.

Note 2 - Restructuring Charges

In December 1993, the Company announced its decision to integrate its sanitary 
supply business with the core business. Based on the results of that program, 
the Company announced in July 1994 its intention to similarly integrate its 
Allied Safety (safety products) and Bossert Industrial Supply (production 
consumable products) units. In conjunction with the integration of these 
business units, the Company also began the process of consolidating financial, 
information services, and human resource functions. In the fourth quarter, the 
Company recorded a $67,097,000 pretax charge ($48,398,000 or 94 cents per 
share on an after tax basis) to recognize the expected costs associated with 
the above efforts. Total restructuring charges for 1994 and 1993 were:

NOTE 3-BUSINESS ACQUISITION

Effective May 1, 1992, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets and 
business of Lab Safety Supply, Inc., a leading direct marketer and distributor 
of safety products. The acquisition included cash payments of $161,343,000 and 
the assumption of certain liabilities of Lab Safety Supply, Inc. including 
$8,227,000 of long-term debt. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. 
Included in the purchase price was $121,367,000 which was allocated to 
intangibles including customer list and goodwill, to be amortized over useful 
lives of five to forty years. The acquisition was funded from internal sources 
and the issuance of $72,727,000 of short-term debt.The following unaudited pro 
forma summary combines the consolidated results of operations of the Company 
and Lab Safety Supply, Inc. as if the acquisition had occurred at the 
beginning of 1992. The pro forma amounts give effect to certain adjustments, 
including the amortization of intangibles, the amortization of non-competition 
agreements, certain executive compensation, increased interest expense, lost 
interest income, and income tax effects. This pro forma summary does not

NOTE 5 CASH

Checks outstanding of $37,088,000, $16,521,000, and $23,713,000 are included 
in Trade accounts payable at December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

NOTE 6-CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company places temporary cash investments with institutions of high credit 
quality and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one 
institution.The Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse 
industries doing business in all regions of the United States. Consequently, 
in management's opinion, no significant concentration of credit risk exists 
for the Company.

NOTE 7-INVENTORIES

Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale.Inventories 
would have been $184,364,000, $179,450,000, and $168,363,000 higher than 
reported at December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively, if the first-in, 
first-out (FIFO) method of inventory accounting had been used.

NOTE 8-OTHER ASSETS
Included in other assets are intangibles such as customer lists and goodwill. 
Customer lists are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of five to 
sixteen years. Goodwill represents the cost in excess of net assets of 
acquired companies and is amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years. 
The carrying value of intangible assets is periodically reviewed by the 
Company and impairments are recognized when the present value of projected 
future cash flows is less than their carrying value. Other assets at December 
31, 1994, 1993, and 1992 were:

Other assets decreased in 1994 primarily due to the revaluation of goodwill 
and other intangibles that occurred in conjunction with the fourth quarter 
restructuring charge as described in Note 2.

NOTE 9-SHORT-TERM DEBT

During 1994 and 1993, the Company borrowed funds to finance working capital 
needs. In 1992, the Company borrowed funds to partially finance the

The Company had available lines of credit of $54,000,000 at December 31, 1994, 
$28,500,000 at December 31, 1993, and $75,000,000 at December 31, 1992. Of the 
total available at December 31, 1994, $50,000,000 were in place to support 
commercial paper outstanding, and carried commitment fees of 1/8%. There were 
no borrowings under these credit lines. The remaining $4,000,000 credit line 
available at December 31, 1994 was used to support working capital needs. This 
line carried a commitment fee of 1/4% and an additional fee of 1/8% on the 
unused portion.

NOTE 10-EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

RETIREMENT PLANS. A majority of the Company's employees are covered by a 
noncontributory profit sharing plan. This plan provides for annual employer 
contributions based upon a formula related primarily to earnings before 
federal income taxes, limited to 15% of the total compensation paid to all 
eligible employees. The Company also sponsors additional profit sharing and 
defined contribution plans which cover most other employees. Provisions under 
all plans were $46,117,000, $42,056,000, and $37,289,000 for the years ended 
December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. The Company has a health care benefits plan covering 
most of its retired employees and their dependents. A majority of the 
Company's employees become eligible for these benefits when they qualify 
for retirement while working for the Company. On January 1, 1993, the Company 
adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other 
Than Pensions". The statement requires the Company to accrue the estimated 
cost of providing postretirement benefits during the working careers of those 
employees who could become eligible for such benefits when they retire. 
Because the Company had previously accrued postretirement benefits, the effect 
of adoption of SFAS No. 106 was not material.The amount charged to operating 
expense for postretirement benefits was $3,153,000, $2,600,000, and $2,000,000 
for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. 
Components of the 1994 and 1993 expense were:

                                                 1994              1993

Participation in the plan is voluntary at retirement and requires participants 
to make contributions, as determined by the Company, toward the cost of the 
plan. The accounting for the health plan anticipates future cost-sharing 
changes to retiree contributions that will maintain the current cost-sharing 
ratio between the Company and the retirees. A Group Benefit Trust has been 
established as the vehicle to process benefit payments. The assets of the 
trust are invested in a Standard & Poors 500 index fund. The assumed weighted 
average long-term rate of return is 5.9%, which is net of a 42.3% tax rate.The 
funding of the trust includes an estimated amount which is intended to allow 
the maximum deductible contribution under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
as amended, and was $737,000, $211,000, and $1,579,000 for the years ended 
December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

A reconciliation of funded status as of December 31, 1994 and 1993 is as

In determining the APBO as of December 31, 1994, the assumed weighted average 
discount rate used was 8.5%. To determine the APBO as of December 31, 1993, 
the assumed weighted average discount rate was 7.3%. The assumed health care 
cost trend rate for 1994 through 1998 was 10.0%. Beginning in 1999, the 
assumed health care cost trend rate declines on a straight-line basis until 
2008, when the ultimate trend rate of 5.6% will be achieved.If the assumed 
health care cost trend rate was increased by one percentage point for each 
year, the APBO as of December 31, 1994 would increase by $4,637,000. The 
aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the 1994 net 
periodic postretirement benefits expense would increase by $921,000.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. In the fourth quarter of 1993, retroactive to January 
1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employer's Accounting for 
Postemployment Benefits". This statement requires the accrual of certain 
benefits provided to former or inactive employees, after employment but before 
retirement, if attributable to an employee's service already rendered.The 
Company benefits accrued under SFAS No. 112 included long-term disability 
health care benefits, short-term disability salary continuation benefits, and 
COBRA benefits in excess of participant contributions. The cumulative effect 
at January 1, 1993 of adopting SFAS No. 112 reduced Net earnings by $4,033,000 
or eight cents per share. The effect of this change on 1993 Net earnings 
before the cumulative effect of accounting changes was not material.

NOTE 11-LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31:

The industrial development revenue bonds include various issues that bear 
interest at a variable rate up to 15%, or variable rates up to 78.2% of the 
prime rate, and come due in various amounts from 2001 through 2011. Interest 
rates on some of the issues are subject to change at certain dates in the 
future. The bondholders may require the Company to redeem certain bonds 
concurrent with a change in interest rates and certain other bonds annually. 
At December 31, 1994, all of the bonds were subject to these redemption 
options. In addition, $12,045,000 of these bonds had an unsecured liquidity 
facility available at December 31, 1994 for which the Company compensated a 
bank through a commitment fee of 1/8%. There were no borrowings related to 
these facilities at December 31, 1994. The Company classified $26,150,000, 
$21,255,000, and $20,555,000 of bonds currently subject to redemption 
options in current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 1994, 1993, 
and 1992, respectively.The aggregate amounts of long-term debt maturing in 
each of the five years subsequent to December 31, 1994

NOTE 13-STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

The Company's Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan ("The Plan"), allows the Company 
to grant a variety of incentive awards to key employees of the Company. These 
awards involve the use of a maximum of 4,028,414 shares of common stock, in 
connection with awards of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation 
rights, restricted stock, phantom stock rights, and other stock based 
awards.The Plan authorizes the granting of restricted stock which is held by 
the Company until certain terms and conditions as specified by the Company are 
satisfied. Except for the right of disposal, holders of restricted stock have 
full shareholders' rights during the period of restriction, including voting 
rights and the right to receive dividends. Compensation expense related to 
restricted stock awards is based upon market price at date of grant and is 
charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the period of restriction.
The Plan authorizes the granting of options to purchase shares at a price of 
not less than 85% of the closing market price on the last trading day 
preceding the date of grant. The options expire within ten years after the 
date of grant. The Plan also permits the granting of stock appreciation 
rights, either alone or in tandem with options already granted and to be 
granted in the future. The stock appreciation rights permit the holder to 
receive stock, cash, or a combination thereof, equal to the amount by which 
the fair market value on the date of exercise exceeds the option price. 
Exercise of a stock option or a stock appreciation right automatically cancels 
any respective tandem stock appreciation right or stock option. Shares covered 
by terminated, surrendered or cancelled options or stock appreciation rights 
that are unexercised, by forfeited restricted stock, or by the forfeiture of 
other awards that do not result in shares being issued, are again available 
for awards under the Plan.

In 1994, 1993, and 1992, 4,615 shares of restricted stock were released each 
year. There were no shares of restricted stock issued in 1994 or 1992. There 
were 2,650 shares of restricted stock issued in 1993.

There was no activity relating to stock appreciation rights in 1994, 1993, or 
1992, and at December 31, 1994, there were no stock appreciation rights 
outstanding.
Transactions involving stock options are summarized as follows:

NOTE 14-ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

The Company has adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which there is 
outstanding one preferred share purchase right (Right) for each outstanding 
share of the Company's Common Stock. Each Right, under certain circumstances, 
may be exercised to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior 
Participating Preferred Stock (intended to be the economic equivalent of one 
share of the Company's Common Stock) at a price of $125, subject to 
adjustment. The Rights become exercisable only after a person or a group, 
other than a person or group exempt under the plan, acquires or announces a 
tender offer for 20% or more of the Company's Common Stock.If a person or 
group, other than a person or group exempt under the plan, acquires 20% or 
more of the Company's Common Stock or if the Company is acquired in a merger 
or other business combination transaction, each Right generally entitles the 
holder, other than such person or group, to purchase, at the then-current 
exercise price, stock and/or other securities or assets of the Company or the 
acquiring company having a market value of twice the exercise price.The Rights 
expire on May 15, 1999 unless earlier redeemed. They generally are 
redeemable at $.01 per Right until thirty days following announcement that a 
person or group, other than a person or group exempt under the plan, has 
acquired 20% or more of the Company's Common Stock. They are also 
automatically redeemable, at the redemption price, upon consummation of 
certain transactions approved by shareholders in accordance with procedures 
provided in the plan.The Rights do not have voting or dividend rights and, 
until they become exercisable, have no dilutive effect on the earnings of the 
Company.

NOTE 15-INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for 
Income Taxes". The cumulative effect of this accounting change increased net 
earnings by $3,213,000 or six cents per share in 1993. The adoption of SFAS 
No. 109 changed the Company's method of accounting for income taxes from the 
deferred method to an asset and liability approach. Previously the Company 
deferred the tax effects of timing differences between financial reporting 
income and taxable income. The asset and liability approach requires the 
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax 
consequences of temporary differences between the financial bases and the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities.Income tax expense consisted of the following:

In 1993, the Company elected early adoption of SFAS No. 112, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", which resulted in an after tax charge 
of eight cents per share. The Company also adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
