                                     PART I
Item 1: Business

The Company
The registrant,  W.W. Grainger,  Inc., was incorporated in the State of Illinois
in 1928. It is the leading North American provider of maintenance,  repair,  and
operating (MRO) supplies,  services,  and related  information to businesses and
institutions.  W.W.  Grainger,  Inc.  regards  itself  as being  in the  service
business.  As used  herein,  "Company"  means W.W.  Grainger,  Inc.,  and/or its
subsidiaries  as the context may  require.  In late 1997,  the Company  began an
organizational  restructuring with the formation of several business operations.
Several of these  operations were  originally part of the Grainger  branch-based
business.  In addition,  Grainger  Integrated Supply began refocusing on serving
customers through materials  management  service  contracts.  These changes were
made to create greater focus and  accountability in serving the diverse needs of
the  Company's  customers.  1998  was a  transition  year  in  establishing  the
refocused  organization.  Further  refinements  in  1999  were  in  response  to
significant  initiatives designed to take advantage of the opportunities created
by  Internet   commerce,   including  two  new  businesses,   OrderZone.com  and
FindMRO.com.

The Company offers a breadth of MRO solutions by combining  products,  services,
and information.  It tailors its capabilities  toward the objective of providing
the lowest total cost MRO solution to select customer  groups.  The Branch-based
Distribution Businesses serve primarily North American businesses with immediate
and/or planned purchase MRO needs. The Digital Businesses offer a broad array of
indirect  materials  and  related  information  to meet the needs of  businesses
looking to reduce process costs through  Internet-enabled  solutions.  The Other
Businesses of the Company serve  customers who seek to outsource  their indirect
procurement  and management  process or customers who choose to purchase  safety
and other industrial  products through a direct marketing  company.

The Company also has business support  functions which provide  coordination and
guidance in the areas of Accounting, Administrative Services, Aviation, Business
Development,  Communications,  Compensation and Benefits,  Employee Development,
Finance, Government Regulations, Human Resources, Industrial Relations, Investor
Relations,   Insurance  and  Risk  Management,   Internal  Audit,  International
Operations, Legal, Planning, Real Estate and Construction Services, Security and
Safety,  Taxes,  and Treasury  services.  These services are provided in varying
degrees to all of the business units.

A number of  Company-wide  capabilities  assist  business units in serving their
respective  markets.  These  capabilities  include  technology  and  information
management,  supplier  partnerships,  supply chain  integration  skills,  and an
understanding of the customers' MRO environments.

The Company's efforts are guided by two major strategic  objectives  designed to
drive sales growth and provide value:

o    Develop and embrace Internet-enabled  solutions to strengthen the Company's
     current capabilities and help fashion the future of the MRO marketplace.
o    Create  focused  businesses  to serve  customer  needs and find new  growth
     opportunities within existing businesses.

The  Company  does not  engage  in basic or  substantive  product  research  and
development  activities.  New items are added regularly to the Company's product
lines on the  basis of market  information,  recommendations  of its  employees,
customers,  and  suppliers,  and  other  factors.  The  Company's  research  and
development effort is focused on new methods of serving customers.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

The  Company's  Branch-based  Distribution  Businesses  provide  customers  with
solutions to their immediate  and/or planned purchase MRO needs throughout North
America.  Logistics  networks are  configured  for rapid  availability.  A broad
selection of MRO  products is offered at local  branches  through  user-friendly
catalogs and via the Internet. The Branch-based  Distribution Businesses consist
of Grainger Industrial Supply,  Grainger.com,  Acklands-Grainger  Inc., Grainger
Custom  Solutions,  Grainger Export,  Grainger Global Sourcing,  Grainger Parts,
Grainger,  S.A. de C.V. (Mexico),  and Puerto Rico. Described below are the more
significant of these businesses.

Grainger Industrial Supply
- ---------------------------
The focus of Grainger  Industrial  Supply is to provide the best  combination of
product  selection,  local  availability,  speed of delivery,  and simplicity of
ordering at a competitive price to North American businesses and institutions of
all sizes. Its primary customers are small and medium-sized  companies.  It also
addresses large-sized organizations' MRO needs.

Grainger  Industrial  Supply  operates  371  branches  in all 50  states.  These
branches are located within minutes of the majority of U.S. businesses and carry
inventory  to support  their local market  needs.  Products  are  available  for
immediate pick up, same-day shipment, or delivery.


An average branch has 15 employees and handles about 260  transactions  per day.
During  1999,  an  average  of  approximately  96,700  sales  transactions  were
completed daily.  Each branch tailors its inventory to local product demand.  In
1999,  Grainger Industrial Supply invested more than $6,800,000 in new branches,
relocations,  and  additions to branches.  During the year 22 new branches  were
opened,  three  were  relocated,  and  a  number  of  remodeling  projects  were
completed.

Grainger  Industrial  Supply  has  six  Zone  Distribution   Centers  (ZDCs)  in
operation.  ZDCs ship orders  directly to customers for all branches  located in
their zone, including Internet orders. The ZDC logistics network also provides a
break-bulk function for faster branch stock replenishment.

Two Regional  Distribution  Centers (RDCs) located in Greenville  County,  South
Carolina,  and Kansas City,  Missouri,  provide the  branches  with  product.  A
National  Distribution  Center  (NDC)  is a  centralized  storage  and  shipping
facility  serving  customers and the entire network with slower moving inventory
items.  The  Company  plans to  remodel  its  distribution  network  to  improve
warehouse productivity, and provide additional capacity for efficient support of
future growth.

During 1998,  Grainger  Industrial  Supply began its conversion  from its legacy
systems to a new business  enterprise  system.  Conversion at all branch and ZDC
locations was completed in 1999.

Grainger  Industrial  Supply sells  principally to  contractors,  service shops,
industrial  and  commercial  maintenance  departments,   manufacturers,  hotels,
government,  and health  care and  educational  facilities.  Sales  transactions
during 1999 were made to more than  1,400,000  customers.  It is estimated  that
approximately  24% of 1999  sales  consisted  of  items  bearing  the  Company's
registered trademarks, including DAYTON(R) (principally electric motors, heating
and  ventilation   equipment),   TEEL(R)  (liquid  pumps),   SPEEDAIRE(R)   (air
compressors),  AIRHANDLER(R)  (air  filtration  equipment),  DEM-KOTE(R)  (spray
paints),  WESTWARD(R) (hand and power tools),  and LUMAPRO(TM) (task and outdoor
lighting),  as well as other trademarks.  The Company has taken steps to protect
these  trademarks  against  infringement  and  believes  that they  will  remain
available for future use in its  business.  Sales of remaining  items  generally
consisted of products carrying the names of other well recognized brands.

The Grainger Industrial Supply catalog offers more than 85,000 MRO products from
more than  1,000  suppliers,  most of whom are  manufacturers.  Approximately  2
million copies of the catalog were distributed in 1999. The most current edition
was  issued in  January  2000.  The  largest  supplier  in 1999,  a  diversified
manufacturer through 20 of its divisions,  accounted for about 10% of purchases.
No  significant  difficulty  has been  encountered  with  respect  to sources of
supply.

The Grainger Industrial Supply CD ROM catalog is designed to bring,  directly to
the customer's place of business,  a fast, easy way to select products.  Through
the CD ROM catalog,  the customer can use a variety of ways to describe a needed
product,  and then review Grainger Industrial Supply's offerings,  complete with
specifications,  prices, and pictures. Another CD ROM catalog feature includes a
cross-reference  function that allows customers to retrieve product  information
using their own stock  numbers.  More than 350,000  copies of the CD ROM catalog
version were produced for  distribution in 1999. The CD ROM catalog is also used
at the  branches as a training  tool and resource  for  identifying  appropriate
products for customers' applications.

Grainger.com
- ------------
The  Grainger.com  site was one of the first MRO Web sites.  This Web site is an
"e-store  front"  or "point  of  access"  into the  Grainger  Industrial  Supply
business.  Grainger.com,  however,  offers more products,  automated search, and
customer  personalization.  It is  available  24 hours a day,  seven days a week
providing real-time availability, customer specific pricing, search engines, and
a number of other enhancements.

Customers  have  access  to a much  larger  selection  of MRO  products  through
Grainger.com,  which has more than 220,000 products available. The average order
size is approaching  twice the average order size in the physical  world.  About
20% of orders are placed  after hours.  Orders  processed  through  Grainger.com
resulted in sales of approximately $100,000,000 in 1999 and $13,500,000 in 1998.
Based on year end  volumes,  the Company  estimated that the annualized run rate
for orders processed through  Grainger.com was more than  $200,000,000.  For the
third year in a row,  Grainger.com was named among the top  business-to-business
Internet sites in the world by Advertising Age's Business Marketing Magazine.

Acklands-Grainger Inc. (AGI)
- ----------------------------
AGI, acquired in December 1996, is Canada's leading  branch-based broad line MRO
distributor. It serves customers through 188 branches and 6 distribution centers
across  Canada.  AGI  distributes  tools,   lighting,   HVAC,  safety  supplies,
pneumatics,  instruments,  welding  equipment  and  supplies,  motors,  and shop
equipment,  as well as many  other  items.  A  comprehensive  catalog is used to
showcase the product line and to help customers select  products.  This catalog,
with  over  70,000   products   listed,   supports  the  efforts  of  275  sales
representatives  throughout  Canada and is printed in both  English  and French.
During 1999, an average of 17,900 sales transactions were completed daily.




Grainger Custom Solutions
- --------------------------

Grainger  Custom  Solutions was formed in 1998. Its business is to provide large
organizations  with  planned MRO products  across  multiple  indirect  materials
categories.  These services are marketed primarily to companies that are looking
for some of the  benefits of  integrated  supply,  but are not ready for a total
outsourcing solution or on-site management services.

Grainger  Custom  Solutions  offers to provide cost savings through supply chain
optimization  and  enhanced  information   technology,   as  well  as  products,
logistics, and services specific to a customer's situation.

In 1998,  the business  began  operating two call centers and four  distribution
centers. A fifth distribution center was opened during 1999.

The business focuses on planned  delivery of seven core commodity  product lines
with access to other broad product lines from Grainger  Industrial  Supply.  The
business employed 161 sales representatives at December 31, 1999.

Grainger Global Sourcing
- ------------------------
Grainger  Global  Sourcing's  business  is  to  procure   competitively  priced,
high-quality  products  sourced outside the United States.  These items are sold
primarily  under private label by Grainger  Industrial  Supply and the Company's
other  businesses.  Products  obtained  through Grainger Global Sourcing in 1999
include WESTWARD(R) tools and LUMAPRO(TM) lighting products.

Grainger Parts
- --------------

Grainger Parts provides access to over 285,000 parts and accessories through its
centralized warehouse located in Northbrook,  Illinois.  More than 180,000 pages
of parts diagrams are maintained on-line. Grainger Parts handled about 1,700,000
customer  calls in 1999 through its call centers in  Northbrook,  Illinois,  and
Waterloo, Iowa.

Grainger  Parts has been ISO 9002  certified  since 1995.  Grainger  Parts' 100%
compliance  with  ISO  9002  standards  ranked  it  among  the  top  10%  of all
ISO-certified companies.

Grainger, S.A. de C.V.
- ----------------------
Grainger,  S.A. de C.V. serves the traditional MRO product needs of customers in
Mexico.  The business  employed 95 sales  representatives  at December 31, 1999.
From its 80,000 square foot facility outside  Monterrey,  the business  provides
delivery of over 72,000 products  throughout Mexico. A new branch in Guadalajara
is  scheduled  to  open in  2000.


Digital  Businesses

designed to meet a number of the needs of customers  including  product  search,
product sourcing,  supplier  management,  order processing,  order  fulfillment,
technical support facilitation, and logistics management.

Grainger Auction
- ----------------
Launched in November  1999,  Grainger  Auction  provided an outlet for  Grainger
Industrial Supply to move discontinued  inventory,  which is undamaged  products
that are not the  latest  versions,  or excess  inventory.  Initially,  the site
handled  discontinued  inventory  from  Grainger  Industrial  Supply.   Customer
response was such that Grainger  Auction was established as a separate  business
in early 2000. The site will be opened to Company suppliers,  additional Company
businesses, and others.

Industry  Segments

Segment reporting was modified in 1999 to recognize the emphasis being placed on
the Company's  digital  strategy and to reflect the role of Grainger.com  within
the Branch-based  Distribution  segment.  The new segment reporting reflects how
management is evaluating business operations.  For 1999 the Company is reporting
two  industry  segments:  Branch-based  Distribution  and  Digital.  For segment
information and the Company's  consolidated  revenue and operating  earnings see
"Item 7:  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and the
Results of  Operations,"  and "Item 8: Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary
Data."  The total  assets of the  Company  for the last five years  were:  1999,
$2,564,826,000;  1998, $2,103,966,000;  1997, $2,000,116,000;  1996,
$2,119,021,000; and 1995, $1,669,243,000.

Competition

The Company faces competition in all the markets it serves,  from  manufacturers
(including  some of the Company's own  suppliers)  that sell directly to certain
segments of the market, from wholesale  distributors,  from catalog houses, from
certain Internet-based  businesses and product fulfillment mechanisms,  and from
certain retail enterprises.

The principal means by which the Company competes with  manufacturers  and other
distributors  is  by  local  stock  availability,   efficient  service,  account
managers,  competitive  pricing,  its several  catalogs,  which include  product
descriptions  and in certain cases,  extensive  technical and application  data,
procurement  process  consulting  services,  electronic  and  Internet  commerce
technology,  and other efforts to assist  customers in lowering  their total MRO
costs.  The Company  believes that it can  effectively  compete on a price basis
with its manufacturing  competitors on small orders, but that such manufacturers
may enjoy a cost advantage in filling large orders.

The Company  serves a number of diverse  markets and is able in some  markets to
reasonably  estimate  the  Company's  competitive  position  within that market.
However,  taken as a whole, the Company is unable to determine its market shares
relative to others engaged in whole or in part in similar activities.

Employees

As of December 31, 1999, the Company had 16,730  employees,  14,030 of whom were
full-time  and 2,700 were  part-time or  temporary.  The Company has never had a
major work stoppage and considers its employee relations generally to be good.


Item 2: Properties

As of December 31,  1999,  the  Company's  owned and leased  facilities  totaled
17,707,000  square  feet,  an  increase of 5.4% over 1998.  Grainger  Industrial
Supply and Acklands-Grainger  Inc. (AGI) accounted for the majority of the total
square footage. Grainger Industrial Supply facilities are located throughout the
United States. AGI facilities are located throughout Canada.

Grainger  Industrial  Supply branches range in size from 1,000 to 109,000 square
feet  and  average  21,000  square  feet.  Most  are  located  in or near  major
metropolitan areas, many in industrial parks.  Typically,  an owned branch is on
one floor, is of masonry  construction,  consists  primarily of warehouse space,
contains  an  air-conditioned  office  and sales  area,  and has  off-the-street
parking for customers and employees.  The Company  considers that its properties
are  generally  in good  condition  and well  maintained  and are  suitable  and
adequate to carry on the Company's business.

The significant  facilities of the Company are briefly described below:

(1)  These  facilities are either owned or leased with leases  expiring  between
     2000 and 2004. The owned  facilities  are not subject to any mortgages.  In
     1999, the Company  completed the  construction  of an office  facility,  on
     owned property,  to house a large portion of the  Chicago-area  work force.
     Certain  Chicago-area  owned and leased office facilities were vacated when
     the new Lake Forest, Illinois facility became operational.

(2)  Grainger  Industrial  Supply  branches  consist  of 302 owned and 69 leased
     properties. The owned facilities are not subject to any mortgages.

(3)  Other  facilities  represent  owned  and  leased  general  branch  offices,
     distribution centers, and branches. Two branches are located in Puerto Rico
     and one  branch/distribution  center is located in Monterrey,  Mexico.  The
     owned facilities are not subject to any mortgages.

(4)  AGI  facilities  consist  of general  offices,  distribution  centers,  and
     branches  that are either  owned or leased.  The owned  facilities  are not
     subject to any mortgages.


Item 3: Legal Proceedings

There are pending  various legal and  administrative  proceedings  involving the
Company that are incidental to the business. It is not expected that the outcome
of any such  proceeding  will have a material  adverse effect upon the Company's
consolidated financial position or its results of operations.


Item 4: Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security  Holders

No  matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders  during the fourth
quarter of 1999.

Executive  Officers of the Company

Following is information about the Executive Officers of the Company as of March
1, 2000. Executive Officers of the Company generally serve until the next annual
election of officers, or until earlier resignation or removal.

Item 6: Selected Financial Data


Item 7:  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and the
         Results of Operations

                              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company  continues  to tailor its  capabilities  to provide the lowest total
cost MRO solution to each customer group. In this connection,  segment reporting
was modified in 1999 to recognize  the  emphasis  being placed on the  Company's
digital strategy and to reflect the role of Grainger.com within the Branch-based
Distribution  segment.  The new segment  reporting  reflects how  management  is
evaluating  business  operations.  While 1999 and 1998 data are  reported on the
basis of the new segments,  1997 data are not because of the impracticability of
restatement. (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The  following  table is  included  as an aid to  understanding  changes  in the
Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings.



Company Net Sales - 1999 Compared to 1998
- -----------------------------------------

The Company's net sales of $4,533,853,000 for 1999 increased 4.4% from net sales
of  $4,341,269,000  for 1998. This increase resulted from a 3.3% increase in the
Branch-based  Distribution  Businesses segment, a 498.6% increase in the Digital
Businesses  segment,  and a 17.2%  increase in the Other  Business  Units of the
Company.  Since 1999 had one fewer sales day than did 1998 (254 versus 255), the
Company's net sales increased 4.8% on a daily basis.

Despite a soft  industrial  economy  in the  United  States,  sales  growth  was
positive  in 1999  versus  1998.  Sales  growth for the year 1999 was  primarily
volume-driven,   reflecting   the   favorable   effects   from   the   Company's
customer-focused  business unit  strategy,  new marketing  initiatives,  and the
continuing acceleration in Internet transactions.  Sales growth was constrained,
however,  by customer service issues at Grainger  Industrial Supply and Grainger
Parts related to the field rollout of the new enterprise resource planning (ERP)
system.  A total of  $20,000,000  of sales are  estimated to have been lost as a
result of these service issues.

Segment Net Sales

The following  comments at the segment level include  external and  intersegment
net sales; those comments at the business unit level include external and inter-
and intrasegment net sales.

Branch-based Distribution Businesses

Sales at the Branch-based  Distribution Businesses amounted to $4,132,591,000 in
1999, a 3.3%  increase  over 1998 sales of  $4,002,051,000.  Average daily sales
increased by 3.7%.


Grainger  Industrial  Supply  -  Average  daily  sales  increased  2% in 1999 as
compared with 1998.  Contributing  to the 1999 sales growth were the addition of
22 new branches  during the year and increased sales to large  customers.  Sales
were  negatively  affected  by  approximately  $18,000,000  as a  result  of the
customer  service issues  discussed  above.  Sales prices decreased 0.7% in 1999
versus 1998.

This business also realized  incremental  sales of  $15,000,000  during the 1999
fourth  quarter,  including  $7,000,000  in December  1999,  related to customer
concerns about Y2K.  Products  affected included  generators,  flashlights,  and
batteries.

Sales were favorably  affected by continued  momentum in the Company's  Internet
strategy.   Orders  for  sales  processed  through  Grainger.com  in  1999  were
approximately  $100,000,000.  Based on year-end volumes, the annualized run rate
for  orders   processed   through   Grainger.com  was  estimated  at  more  than
$200,000,000.

Acklands-Grainger  Inc.  (Canada) - Average daily sales  increased 6% in 1999 as
compared  with 1998.  This  increase  was driven by growth in both  Eastern  and
Western Canada.  The growth in Eastern Canada was primarily  attributable to the
addition of 14 new branches  during 1999 and 1998.  The growth in Western Canada
was  driven  by an  improvement  in the oil and gas,  forestry,  and  industrial
sectors of the economy, along with gains in sales to large customers,  including
government agencies. In Canadian dollars, average daily sales increased 7%.

Grainger,  S.A. de C.V.  (Mexico) - Average daily sales increased 16% in 1999 as
compared  with  1998.  This  sales  growth   reflects  the  continuing   planned
development of this new business.  A key driver was increased sales to customers
located in  Mexico's  interior,  who are  served by the  Company's  facility  in
Monterrey.

Grainger Custom Solutions - Average daily sales decreased 2% in 1999 as compared
with 1998.  The focus of this business is the  transitioning  of large,  complex
customers  to the new  business  platform,  while  pursuing  rationalization  of
facilities and other synergies with Grainger Industrial Supply.

Digital Businesses

Sales at the  Digital  Businesses  amounted  to  $2,977,000  in  1999,  a 498.6%
increase  over 1998 sales of $497,000.  These sales  include  product  sales and
service fee revenues for FindMRO.com and service fee revenues for OrderZone.com.
Both  businesses  were  officially  launched in 1999.  Revenue  recorded in 1998
represents intracompany sales for FindMRO.com.

Other Business Units

Sales at the Other Businesses amounted to $415,152,000 in 1999, a 17.2% increase
over 1998 sales of $354,360,000. This equates to an average daily sales increase
of 17.6%.

Grainger  Integrated  Supply - Average  daily  sales  increased  48% for 1999 as
compared with 1998. Sales for this business unit include product  throughput and
management fees. Growth was driven by new engagements,  contract  renewals,  and
scope expansions,  reflecting  increasing demand for this outsourcing  business,
which provides  fee-based,  on-site indirect  materials  management  services to
large businesses.

Lab Safety  Supply - Average  daily sales  increased 8% in 1999 as compared with
1998. This sales growth is largely  attributable to Lab Safety Supply's  product
line expansion program.

Company Net Sales - 1998 Compared to 1997
- -----------------------------------------
As used  within  this  section,  the  term  "Grainger  branch-based  businesses"
reflects the  operations of the Company  excluding  Acklands-Grainger  Inc., Lab
Safety Supply, Inc., and Grainger Parts.

The 1998  Company  net sales  increase  of 4.9%,  as  compared  with  1997,  was
principally volume related.  This increase primarily  represented the effects of
the Company's marketing initiatives,  which included new product additions,  and
the  National  Accounts,  Integrated  Supply,  and  direct  marketing  programs.
Partially offsetting the growth from these initiatives was a decline in sales at
Acklands-Grainger  Inc. (AGI), the Company's Canadian  subsidiary.  This decline
resulted from an unfavorable  change in the Canadian  exchange rate. In Canadian
dollars,  AGI's sales rate was  relatively  flat when  comparing 1998 with 1997.
Weak demand in the mining,  forestry, oil, exploration,  and agriculture sectors
was the primary  cause for AGI's flat sales  performance.  The  Company's  sales
growth rate was 6.1% after excluding AGI from both 1998 and 1997.

The Company's Grainger branch-based business experienced selling price increases
of about 0.7% when comparing 1998 with 1997. Sales to National Account customers
within  the  Grainger   branch-based   businesses   increased  to  approximately
$1,120,000,000.  Sales to National  Account  customers  increased about 8%, on a
comparable basis, over 1997.


Company Net Earnings - 1999 Compared to 1998
- --------------------------------------------
The Company's net earnings of  $180,731,000  for 1999  decreased  24.2% compared
with 1998 net  earnings  of  $238,504,000.  This  decline  resulted  from  lower
operating  earnings and higher other deductions.  Operating earnings declined at
the Branch-based  Distribution Businesses and the loss at the Digital Businesses
increased.  Operating  earnings improved at the Other Businesses.

The  Company's  Branch-based  Distribution  Businesses  were  affected by system
related customer service issues.  It is estimated that these service issues cost
the Company $32,000,000 in operating earnings in 1999, comprised of gross profit
on lost sales and incremental  operating  expenses.  Also affecting  performance
were the  continuing  investments  incurred to launch,  enhance,  and market the
Company's Internet related businesses.

Segment Operating Earnings

The following  comments at the segment level include  external and  intersegment
operating  earnings;  those comments at the business unit level include external
and inter- and intrasegment operating earnings.

Branch-based  Distribution Businesses

Operating  earnings  of  $357,925,000  declined  18% in  1999 as  compared  with
$435,891,000 for 1998. Operating earnings performance was affected by lower than
expected sales growth,  largely due to weakness in the North American industrial
economy and to system related  customer  service  issues at Grainger  Industrial
Supply and Grainger Parts,  as previously  described.  Also  contributing to the
decline were a slightly lower gross profit margin and higher operating expenses.
Of note are the following factors affecting the gross profit margin:

1.   Grainger Industrial Supply's gross profit margin declined slightly.
2.   Acklands-Grainger  Inc. had a lower gross profit margin primarily due to an
     unfavorable  change in selling price  category mix as a result of increased
     sales to large customers.
3.   The gross profit margin at Grainger Custom Solutions improved.
4.   Sales at Grainger Custom Solutions declined, which had a positive effect on
     the Company's  gross profit margin since Grainger Custom  Solutions'  gross
     profit margin is lower than the Company's average gross profit margin.

Operating  expenses increased about 11% in 1999 versus 1998. This rate of growth
exceeded the rate of growth in net sales due to:

1.   Increased expenses relating to the development of the business in Mexico;
2.   Increased occupancy expenses;
3.   Increased data processing  expense relating to the installation of Grainger
     Industrial Supply's new ERP system;
4.   Increased  expenses incurred to maintain customer service levels during the
     installation of the new ERP system;
5.   Higher  freight  out  expenses  primarily  driven  by  increased  shipments
     qualifying  for  prepaid  freight  and the use of  premium  freight to meet
     service objectives;
6.   Continued  spending  to  develop  and  market  Grainger.com   (Grainger.com
     spending in 1999 was $20,900,000 compared with $6,700,000 in 1998);
7.   Increased  expenses  related to the opening of eight new branches in Canada
     and 22 new branches in the United States; and
8.   Increased  infrastructure  expenses  relating to  developing  the  Grainger
     Custom Solutions business.

The above factors were  partially  offset by decreased  advertising  expenses at
Grainger  Industrial  Supply  resulting  from  increased  cooperative  programs.

Digital  Businesses

The Digital Businesses incurred operating losses of $20,560,000 in 1999 compared
with operating losses of $8,091,000 in 1998.  During 1999 the Company  continued
to  invest  in the  development  of these  businesses.  The  Digital  Businesses
incurred operating expenses of $23,500,000 in 1999 versus $8,600,000 in 1998 for
developing, enhancing, and marketing OrderZone.com and FindMRO.com.

Other Business Units

Operating  earnings of  $26,572,000  increased  43.6% in 1999 as  compared  with
$18,508,000  for 1998.  This  increase was  primarily  attributable  to improved
operating  results at Grainger  Integrated Supply and Lab Safety Supply. Of note
were the following:

1.   The gross profit  margin  decreased  at Grainger  Integrated  Supply.  This
     decrease related to product sales  throughput,  which grew at a faster rate
     than the related management fee income.

2.   Operating expenses at Grainger Integrated Supply decreased from 1998 levels
     while average daily sales increased 48%.

3.   The growth in operating  earnings at Lab Safety Supply was in line with the
     growth in net sales.


Other Income Statement Data

Interest  expense  increased by $8,944,000  in 1999 as compared with 1998.  This
increase  resulted from higher average  borrowings  and higher average  interest
rates  paid on all  outstanding  debt,  partially  offset by higher  capitalized
interest.

Unclassified-net  had a  positive  effect on  earnings  before  income  taxes of
$2,555,000 in 1999 as compared with 1998. In 1999,  the Company  recorded a gain
related to the disposal of facilities in the  Chicagoland  area. The expenses in
1998 were primarily the result of foreign currency  translation  losses relating
to the  Company's  operations  in Mexico and a write-off  of  abandoned  capital
projects.

The Company's effective income tax rate was 40.5% in both 1999 and 1998.

Company Net Earnings - 1998 Compared to 1997
- --------------------------------------------
As used  within  this  section,  the  term  "Grainger  branch-based  businesses"
reflects the  operations of the Company  excluding  Acklands-Grainger  Inc., Lab
Safety Supply,  Inc., and Grainger  Parts.

Net earnings for 1998  increased 2.9% over 1997. The increase for 1998 was lower
than the  increase in net sales due to losses  incurred in  developing  business
ventures, operating expenses increasing at a rate faster than the growth rate in
net  sales,  lower  interest  income,   higher  interest  expense,   and  higher
unclassified-net  expenses,  partially offset by higher gross profit margins.  A
number of factors  contributed to 1998 net earnings  increasing at a slower rate
than 1998 net sales.

1.   The Company continues to invest in developing its business operations.  The
     following operations experienced pretax operating losses for the year 1998:


                                                                    Operating

      Grainger Integrated Supply.......          $80,577            $(17,685)
      Mexico business..................           49,325              (3,399)

     Grainger  Integrated  Supply's  average  daily sales grew about 56% for the
     year  1998  as  compared  with  1997.  Grainger  Integrated  Supply  serves
     customers through materials management services contracts.  These contracts
     are  characterized  by a complete  outsourcing  of the  indirect  materials
     process. Customers not meeting the above definition were transferred to the
     Company's   Grainger  Custom  Solutions  and  Grainger   Industrial  Supply
     businesses  during 1998.

     Average  daily sales in Mexico grew about 21% for the year 1998 as compared
     with 1997.

     Grainger  Integrated Supply and the Mexico business continue to grow sales,
     improve processes, develop systems, and expand marketing programs.

2.   The Company's business-to-business Web site, Grainger.com, allows customers
     to do  business  using the  Internet.  The  Company  developed  an Internet
     marketplace  where  customers will be able to buy products from a number of
     different  suppliers  using a single  site.  This  marketplace  concept  is
     currently  being  tested  with  customers.  In  developing  these  Internet
     initiatives,  the Company  incurred  operating  expenses  of  approximately
     $14,000,000 in 1998 and $6,000,000 in 1997.

3.   Operating  expenses  related to data processing were higher by an estimated
     $15,000,000  as compared with 1997, as adjusted for 1998 volume  increases.
     This  was  primarily  due  to  incurring  expenses  related  to  Year  2000
     compliance  and the ongoing  installation  of the new  business  enterprise
     system.

4.   Operating  expenses were also higher in 1998 versus 1997 as a result of the
     following investments:

     a.   Development of the Grainger Custom Solutions business; and

     b.   Expanded marketing programs at Lab Safety Supply.

The decrease in interest  income  resulted  from lower  average  daily  invested
balances and from lower average interest rates earned.  The increase in interest
expense  resulted from higher  average  interest  rates paid on all  outstanding
debt,  partially  offset by lower average  borrowings and by higher  capitalized
interest.  The higher  unclassified-net  expense primarily resulted from foreign
currency  translation losses relating to the Company's  operations in Mexico and
to a write-off of abandoned capital projects.


The  Company's  gross  profit  margin  increased by 0.67  percentage  point when
comparing the years 1998 and 1997. Of note are the following  factors  affecting
the Company's gross profit margin:

1.   Ongoing programs to reduce product costs improved the gross profit margin.

2.   Selling  price  increases  of 0.7% on Grainger  Industrial  Supply  Catalog
     products improved the gross profit margin.

3.   The change in product mix improved the gross  profit  margin.  The sales of
     Lab Safety  Supply  (generally  higher than average  gross profit  margins)
     increased as a percent of total sales.  The sales of AGI  (generally  lower
     than average gross profit margins) decreased as a percent of total sales.


                                    YEAR 2000

The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer  programs  using two digits rather
than  four to define  the  applicable  year.  Computer  programs  that have date
sensitive  software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than
the year 2000.  This  could  result in  systems  failure  or in  miscalculations
causing disruptions to operations.

The Company's  efforts in response to the Year 2000 issue included the review of
information technology and non-information  technology products and systems, the
remediation or  replacement,  and testing,  of affected  information  technology
systems and  facilities,  the  surveying of key suppliers of goods and services,
and the creation of reasonable  contingency plans to address potentially serious
Year 2000 problems. Expenses associated with the Year 2000 project included both
a reallocation of existing  internal  resources and the use of outside services.
Year 2000 expenses  from the inception of the project  through 1999 year end are
estimated to be  $62,000,000,  of which  $23,000,000  was  attributable to 1999.
Remaining Year 2000 expenses are estimated to be nominal.

The Company did not experience any material systems, product supply, or customer
service  disruptions  as a  result  of  Year  2000  problems.  There  can  be no
assurance,  however, that such disruptions will not occur by reason of Year 2000
or other date-related problems yet to become manifest.


                               FINANCIAL CONDITION

Working  capital  was   $600,611,000   at  December  31,  1999,   compared  with
$541,872,000  at December 31, 1998, and  $649,107,000  at December 31, 1997. The
ratio of current  assets to current  liabilities  was 1.7,  1.8, and 2.2 at such
dates.

Net cash flows from operations of $29,747,000 in 1999, $332,360,000 in 1998, and
$432,910,000 in 1997, have continued to improve the Company's financial position
and serve as the  primary  source  of  funding  for  capital  requirements.  For
information  as to the Company's cash flows,  see "Item 8: Financial  Statements
and Supplementary Data."

In each of the past three years, a portion of working  capital has been used for
additions  to  property,  buildings,  equipment,  and  capitalized  software  as
summarized in the following table.


The  Company  repurchased  355,300  shares  of its  common  stock  during  1999,
4,483,100  shares of its common stock during 1998,  and 8,435,972  shares of its
common  stock during 1997.  As of December  31,  1999,  approximately  5,300,000
shares of common stock remained  available under this repurchase  authorization.

Dividends paid to shareholders  were  $58,817,000 in 1999,  $56,683,000 in 1998,
and $53,934,000 in 1997.

Internally  generated  funds have been the primary source of working capital and
funds needed for expanding the business,  supplemented by debt as  circumstances
dictated.  In addition to continuing facilities  optimization efforts,  business
development, and systems and other infrastructure enhancements,  funds are being
expended to develop and enhance the Company's Internet initiatives.

The  Company  maintains  a debt  ratio  and  liquidity  position  that  provides
reasonable  flexibility  in funding  working  capital needs and  long-term  cash
requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, the Company has various
sources  of  financing  available,  including  commercial  paper  sales and bank
borrowings  under  lines of credit  and  otherwise.  Total  debt as a percent of
Shareholders'  Equity was 30%,  18%, and 12%, at December 31,  1999,  1998,  and
1997, respectively.


                          INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Inflation  during  the last  three  years has not been a  significant  factor to
operations.  The  predominant  use of the last-in,  first-out  (LIFO)  method of
accounting for inventories and  accelerated  depreciation  methods for financial
reporting  and income tax purposes  result in a substantial  recognition  of the
effects of inflation in the primary financial statements.

The major impact of inflation is on buildings  and  improvements,  where the gap
between historic cost and replacement cost continues to be significant for these
long-lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets
increases significantly when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation.

The Company believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the
interests  of  investors  lies  in  continued   application  of  basic  business
principles,  which include improving  productivity,  increasing  working capital
turnover,  and offering  products and  services  which can command  proper price
levels in the marketplace.

                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Throughout  this Form 10-K are  forward-looking  statements  about the Company's
expected  future  financial   results  and  business  plans,   strategies,   and
objectives.  These forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers
such as: "expects," "plans,"  "anticipates,"  "intends," or similar expressions.
There are risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could cause the Company's
results to differ materially from what is projected.

Factors that may affect the  forward-looking  statements  include the following:
higher  product costs or other  expenses;  a major loss of customers;  increased
competitive  pricing pressure on the Company's  businesses;  failure to develop,
implement, or  commercialize  successfully  new Internet  technologies  or other
business   strategies;   the  outcome  of  pending  and  future  litigation  and
governmental   proceedings;   changes  in  laws  and   regulations;   facilities
disruptions or shutdowns due to accidents,  natural acts or governmental action;
unanticipated weather conditions; and other difficulties in improving margins or
financial performance.

Trends and  projections  could also be affected by general  industry  and market
conditions and growth rates,  general economic  conditions,  including  currency
rate fluctuations and other factors.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of
W.W. Grainger, Inc.

   We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  W.W.
Grainger,  Inc., and  Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999,  1998, and 1997, and
the  related  consolidated  statements  of  earnings,   comprehensive  earnings,
shareholders'  equity,  and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

   We  conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of W.W. Grainger,
Inc.,  and  Subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  1999,  1998,  and 1997,  and the
consolidated  results of their operations and their  consolidated cash flows for
the  years  then  ended,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted   accounting
principles.

   We have also audited Schedule II of W.W. Grainger, Inc., and Subsidiaries for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997. In our opinion, this Schedule
presents fairly, in all material  respects,  the information  required to be set
forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997


NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INDUSTRY INFORMATION
The Company is engaged in the distribution of maintenance, repair, and operating
(MRO) supplies, services, and related information to businesses and institutions
in  North  America.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from
the consolidated financial statements.

RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain  amounts  in the 1998  and  1997  financial  statements,  as  previously
reported, have been reclassified to conform to the 1999 presentation.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
In  preparing  financial   statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles,  management is required to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities,  the disclosure of
contingent  assets and liabilities,  and the estimates of revenues and expenses.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial  statements of the Company's  foreign  subsidiaries  are generally
measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Net exchange gains
or losses  resulting  from the  translation  of financial  statements of foreign
operations,   and  related   long-term  debt,   except  for  those  from  highly
inflationary  economies,  are recorded as a separate  component of shareholders'
equity.

INVENTORIES
Inventories  are  valued  at the  lower of cost or  market.  Cost is  determined
primarily by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

PROPERTY, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT
Property, buildings, and equipment are valued at cost.

For financial statement purposes,  depreciation and amortization are provided in
amounts  sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable  assets to operations over
their  estimated  service  lives,   principally  on  the  declining-balance  and
sum-of-the-years-digits  methods.  The principal  estimated useful lives used in
determining depreciation are as follows:

Buildings, structures, and improvements..............             10 to 45 years
Furniture, fixtures, machinery, and equipment........              3 to 10 years

Improvements  to leased  property are  amortized  over the initial  terms of the
respective leases or the estimated service lives of the improvements,  whichever
is shorter.

The  Company  capitalized   interest  costs  of  $3,238,000,   $2,323,000,   and
$1,810,000, in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE
Effective January 1, 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1,
"Accounting  for the  Costs of  Computer  Software  Developed  or  Obtained  for
Internal Use." This statement requires  capitalization of certain costs incurred
in the development of internal-use  software,  including  purchased software and
services and employee payroll and  payroll-related  costs.  Prior to adoption of
SOP 98-1,  the  Company  expensed  portions of these  costs.  The effect of this
change in accounting  principle on earnings for 1999 was immaterial.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived  assets are reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events or changes in
circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  If the
fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying  amount of the
asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues recognized include product sales and fees earned for services provided.
The Company  recognizes  product  sales at the date products are shipped and fee
revenue at the date services are completed.


INCOME  TAXES
Income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the
determination of financial  statement income, with deferred taxes being provided
for temporary  differences  between  financial and tax reporting.

PURCHASED TAX BENEFITS
The Company  purchased tax benefits  through  leases as provided by the Economic
Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Realized tax benefits, net of repayments, are included
in Deferred Income Taxes.

COMPREHENSIVE EARNINGS
The Company's  comprehensive  earnings include  unrealized gains on investments,
net of tax, and foreign currency translation  adjustments with no related income
tax effects.  The cumulative amount of other  comprehensive  earnings (loss) was
$68,791,000,  ($19,564,000),  and  ($9,210,000) at December 31, 1999,  1998, and
1997, respectively.

PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No.  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments and Hedging  Activities."  SFAS No.133 is effective for fiscal years
beginning  after  June 15,  1999  (fiscal  2000 for the  Company).  SFAS No. 133
requires  that all  derivative  instruments  be recorded on the balance sheet at
their fair  value.  Changes in the fair value of  derivatives  are  recorded  in
current-period earnings or other comprehensive earnings,  depending on whether a
derivative is designated as part of a hedge  transaction and, if it is, the type
of hedge transaction.  The ineffective  portion of all hedges will be recognized
in  current-period  earnings.  The Company has determined that SFAS No. 133 will
not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position.

NOTE 2--CASH FLOWS

The Company considers  investments in highly liquid debt instruments,  purchased
with an original  maturity of ninety days or less, to be cash  equivalents.  For
cash  equivalents the carrying amount  approximates  fair value due to the short
maturity of these instruments.

NOTE 3--CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company places temporary cash  investments with  institutions of high credit
quality  and,  by  policy,  limits  the  amount  of credit  exposure  to any one
institution.

The Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries doing
business  in all  regions of the United  States as well as other  areas of North
America. Consequently, no significant concentration of credit risk is considered
to exist.

NOTE 4--INVENTORIES

Inventories primarily consist of merchandise  purchased for resale.

Inventories would have been $211,490,000,  $217,455,000, and $215,707,000 higher
than  reported  at December  31,  1999,  1998,  and 1997,  respectively,  if the
first-in,  first-out (FIFO) method of inventory accounting had been used for all
Company inventories. Inventories under FIFO approximate replacement cost.

NOTE 5--INTANGIBLES

Goodwill  represents the cost in excess of net assets of acquired  companies and
is amortized on a straight-line  basis over periods of five to forty years.  The
Company's  goodwill  is  predominately   denominated  in  Canadian  dollars  and
accordingly,  the changes in the asset balance are due to foreign  exchange rate
fluctuations.

Customer lists and other intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods of eight to seventeen years.

Note 6--Investments

The Company classifies all of its investments as available-for-sale  securities.
These  investments  consist of marketable  securities,  and non-publicly  traded
equity  securities  for  which  a  market  value  is not  readily  determinable.
Marketable  securities  are  reported at fair value,  with  unrealized  gains or
losses on such securities  reflected,  net of taxes, as a separate  component of
shareholders'  equity.  Non-publicly  traded equity  securities  are reported at
cost. There have been no dividends earned on these investments.




At  the  time  of  sale,  any  gains  or  losses,  calculated  on  the  specific
identification method, will be reported in Unclassified-net.


The  Company  had  investments  in  non-publicly  traded  equity  securities  of
$5,000,000  at December 31, 1998 and no such  investments  at December 31, 1997.

NOTE 7--CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

Amortization of capitalized  software is predominately on a straight-line  basis
over five years.  During 1998,  the Company  acquired a new business  enterprise
software system. Amortization expense was $9,840,000, $4,645,000, and $1,556,000
for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

NOTE 8--SHORT-TERM DEBT

The following summarizes information concerning short-term debt:


The  Company  and its  subsidiaries  had  committed  lines  of  credit  totaling
$568,848,000,  $318,069,000,  and  $168,983,000 at December 31, 1999,  1998, and
1997,  respectively,   including  $13,848,000,   $13,069,000,   and  $13,983,000
denominated in Canadian  dollars.  A Company  subsidiary also has a $17,311,000,
$32,673,000,  and $34,958,000 uncommitted line of credit denominated in Canadian
dollars as of December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997,  respectively.  At December 31,
1999,  1998, and 1997,  borrowings  under the  subsidiaries'  committed lines of
credit were $4,598,000,  $3,704,000, and $2,960,000,  respectively.  The Company
has guaranteed these borrowings.

NOTE  9--EMPLOYEE  BENEFITS

RETIREMENT  PLANS.  A  majority  of the  Company's  employees  are  covered by a
noncontributory  profit  sharing plan.  This plan  provides for annual  employer
contributions  based upon a formula related primarily to earnings before federal
income  taxes,  limited to 15% of the total  compensation  paid to all  eligible
employees.  The Company  also  sponsors  additional  profit  sharing and defined
benefit plans,  which cover most of the other  employees.  Provisions  under all
plans  were  $55,007,000,  $65,576,000,  and  $55,052,000  for the  years  ended
December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT  BENEFITS.  The  Company  has a health  care  benefits  plan that
provides  coverage to its retired  employees  and their  dependents  should they
elect to maintain such coverage.  A majority of the Company's  employees  become
eligible for  participation  when they qualify for retirement  while working for
the Company.





The amount charged to operating expense for postretirement  health care benefits
was  $4,523,000,  $4,256,000,  and  $3,653,000  for the years ended December 31,
1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. Components of the expense were:



Participation  in the plan is voluntary at retirement and requires  participants
to make  contributions,  as  determined  by the Company,  toward the cost of the
plan. The accounting for the health plan anticipates future cost-sharing changes
to retiree  contributions  that will  maintain  the current  cost-sharing  ratio
between the Company and the retirees.

A Group Benefit  Trust has been  established  as the vehicle to process  benefit
payments.  The assets of the trust are  invested in a Standard & Poors 500 index
fund. The assumed  weighted  average  long-term rate of return is 7.7%, which is
net of a 33.0% tax rate.  The funding of the trust is an estimated  amount which
is intended  to allow the maximum  deductible  contribution  under the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and was $1,686,000,  $2,444,000, and $859,000,
for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

A  reconciliation  of the  beginning  and  ending  balances  of the  accumulated
postretirement  benefit  obligation  (APBO),  the fair value of assets,  and the
funded status of the benefit  obligation as of December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997
is as follows:


To  determine  the APBO as of December  31, 1999,  1998,  and 1997,  the assumed
weighted average discount rate used was 7.8%, 6.8%, and 7.0%, respectively.  The
assumed  health care cost trend rate for 2000 is 8.0%.  Beginning  in 2001,  the
assumed  health  care cost trend rate  declines on a  straight-line  basis until
2010,  when the ultimate  trend rate of 5.0% is achieved.



If the assumed health care cost trend rate was increased by one percentage point
for each year,  the APBO as of December 31, 1999 would  increase by  $8,254,000.
The aggregate of the service cost and interest  cost  components of the 1999 net
periodic postretirement benefits expense would increase by $1,619,000.

If the assumed health care cost trend rate was decreased by one percentage point
for each year,  the APBO as of December 31, 1999 would  decrease by  $6,537,000.
The aggregate of the service cost and interest  cost  components of the 1999 net
periodic postretirement benefits expense would decrease by $1,235,000.

                                                ========    ========    ========

As part of the  permanent  financing  for a  Canadian  Subsidiary,  the  Company
maintained a $138,485,000 uncommitted revolving credit facility,  denominated in
Canadian dollars. The Company has $124,914,000  outstanding at December 31, 1999
relating to this facility  with a weighted  average  interest rate of 5.8%.  The
Company  has the  intent  and the  ability  to  refinance  the  obligation  on a
long-term  basis  through its credit lines and,  therefore,  the  obligation  is
included in long-term  debt.

The  industrial  development  revenue  bonds  include  various  issues that bear
interest at variable rates up to 15%, or variable rates up to 78.2% of the prime
rate, and come due in various amounts from 2001 through 2021.  Interest rates on
some of the issues are  subject to change at certain  dates in the  future.  The
bondholders  may require the Company to redeem certain bonds  concurrent  with a
change  in  interest  rates and  certain  other  bonds  annually.  In  addition,
$13,545,000  of these bonds had an  unsecured  liquidity  facility  available at
December 31, 1999, for which the Company compensated a bank through a commitment
fee of 0.07%.  There were no borrowings related to this facility at December 31,
1999.  The  Company  classified   $27,650,000  of  bonds  currently  subject  to
redemption options in current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 1999.
The Company  classified  $22,755,000  of bonds subject to redemption  options in
current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 1998 and 1997.

The  aggregate  amounts of  long-term  debt  maturing  in each of the five years
subsequent to December 31, 1999 are as follows:

NOTE 11--LEASES

The  Company  leases  certain  land,  buildings,   and  equipment.  The  Company
capitalizes all significant leases which qualify as capital leases.

At December 31, 1999, the approximate  future minimum aggregate payments for all
leases were as follows:

Total rent  expense,  including  both items  under  lease and items  rented on a
month-to-month  basis, was $19,383,000,  $16,336,000,  and $21,396,000 for 1999,
1998, and 1997, respectively.

NOTE  12--STOCK  INCENTIVE  PLANS

The Company's  Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan ("The Plan") allows the Company to
grant a variety of incentive  awards to key employees of the Company.  A maximum
of 8,056,828  shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the Plan,
in connection with awards of  non-qualified  stock options,  stock  appreciation
rights, restricted stock, phantom stock rights, and other stock-based awards.

The Plan  authorizes  the  granting  of  restricted  stock  which is held by the
Company  until terms and  conditions  specified  by the  Company are  satisfied.
Except  for the  right of  disposal,  holders  of  restricted  stock  have  full
shareholders'  rights during the period of restriction,  including voting rights
and the right to receive dividends.

The Plan authorizes the granting of options to purchase shares at a price of not
less than 100% of the closing market price on the last trading day preceding the
date of grant.  The  options  expire no later  than ten years  after the date of
grant.

Shares  covered  by  terminated,  surrendered  or  canceled  options  and  stock
appreciation  rights,  by forfeited  restricted  stock,  or by the forfeiture of
other awards that do not result in shares being issued,  are again available for
awards under the Plan.

There were  42,000  shares of  restricted  stock  issued in 1999 with a weighted
average  fair  market  value of $45.26 per share.  There were  52,500  shares of
restricted  stock  issued in 1998 with a weighted  average  fair market value of
$52.04 per share.  There were 20,000 shares of  restricted  stock issued in 1997
with a fair market value of $40.125 per share. The shares vest over periods from
three to ten years from issuance,  although  accelerated  vesting is provided in
certain  instances.  Restricted  stock released  totaled 400 and 1,000 shares in
1998 and 1997,  respectively.  There was no restricted  stock  released in 1999.
Compensation  expense  related to  restricted  stock awards is based upon market
price at date of grant and is charged to earnings on a straight-line  basis over
the period of  restriction.  Total  compensation  expense  related to restricted
stock was  $2,178,000,  $2,022,000,  and  $1,872,000  in 1999,  1998,  and 1997,
respectively.

During 1997,  the Company  adopted a Director  Stock Plan in which  non-employee
directors  participate.  A total of 500,000 shares of common stock were reserved
for issuance in connection  with awards of stock,  stock units,  stock  options,
restricted stock, and other stock-based awards under the new plan.

The Company awarded Stock Units under the Director Stock Plan in connection with
the  termination  of  previous  director  compensation  plans.  A Stock  Unit is
essentially  the economic  equivalent  of a share of Company  stock.  Additional
deferred  fees and  dividends  are  converted to Stock Units based on the market
value of the stock at the relevant time.



Payment of the value of Stock Units generally will be made after the termination
of service as a director.  As of December 31, 1999,  nine  directors  held Stock
Units. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997,  eight directors held Stock Units.  The
Company recognized expense of $300,000, $286,000, and $1,850,000 for 1999, 1998,
and 1997, respectively.

Transactions involving stock options are summarized as follows:


All  options  were  issued at market  price on the date of grant.  Options  were
issued with initial vesting periods ranging from immediate to five years.

Information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 1999, is as follows:

December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

In accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,"  the Company has elected to continue
to account for stock compensation under Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No.

The weighted  average fair value of the stock options granted during 1999, 1998,
and 1997 was $17.26,  $16.12, and $12.95,  respectively.  The fair value of each
option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on
the date of the grant and the following weighted average assumptions:

NOTE 13--INCOME TAXES

The Company uses the asset and liability  method of accounting for income taxes.
This method  requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the  expected  future tax  consequences  of  temporary  differences  between the
financial bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

Income tax expense consisted of the following:


                                            1999         1998         1997

                                              (In thousands of dollars)
Current provision:
  Federal (including foreign) ........   $ 106,993    $ 141,462    $ 128,470
  State ..............................      21,336       28,791       27,180
                                         ---------    ---------    ---------
    Total current ....................     128,329      170,253      155,650
Deferred tax (benefits) expenses .....      (5,310)      (7,910)       2,153
                                         ---------    ---------    ---------
Total provision ......................   $ 123,019    $ 162,343    $ 157,803
                                         =========    =========    =========

The deferred tax (benefits)  expenses represent the net effect of the changes in
the amounts of temporary differences.

The  income  tax  effects  of  temporary  differences  that gave rise to the net
deferred tax asset as of December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 were:



The purchased tax benefits  represent lease  agreements  acquired in prior years
under the provisions of the Economic Recovery Act of 1981.

A valuation  allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if realization of the
future  benefit is  uncertain.  Since  1997,  the Company  has  experienced  net
operating losses (NOLs) for a foreign start-up operation. The full amount of the
deferred tax asset is offset by a valuation  allowance due to the uncertainty of
utilizing these NOLs.

A  reconciliation  of income tax expense with U.S.  federal  income taxes at the
statutory rate follows:

NOTE 14--EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic  earnings  per  share is based on the  weighted  average  number of shares
outstanding  during  the  year.  Diluted  earnings  per  share  is  based on the
combination  of  weighted  average  number of shares  outstanding  and  dilutive
potential shares.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
share for the years ended December 31:

NOTE 15--ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

The Company adopted a Shareholder  Rights Plan, under which there is outstanding
one preferred  share  purchase right (Right) for each  outstanding  share of the
Company's  common  stock.  Each  Right,  under  certain  circumstances,  may  be
exercised  to purchase  one  one-hundredth  of a share of Series  A-1999  Junior
Participating  Preferred  Stock  (intended to be the economic  equivalent of one
share  of the  Company's  common  stock)  at a  price  of  $250.00,  subject  to
adjustment.  The Rights become exercisable only after a person or a group, other
than a person or group  exempt  under the plan,  acquires or  announces a tender
offer for 15% or more of the Company's common stock. If a person or group, other
than a person  or group  exempt  under  the  plan,  acquires  15% or more of the
Company's  common  stock or if the  Company  is  acquired  in a merger  or other
business  combination  transaction,  each Right  generally  entitles the holder,
other than such  person or group,  to  purchase,  at the  then-current  exercise
price,  stock and/or other  securities or assets of the Company or the acquiring
company having a market value of twice the exercise price.

The Rights expire on May 15, 2009, unless earlier  redeemed.  They generally are
redeemable at $.001 per Right until thirty days  following  announcement  that a
person  or  group,  other  than a person or group  exempt  under  the plan,  has
acquired  15% or more of the  Company's  common  stock.  The  Rights do not have
voting or dividend rights and, until they become  exercisable,  have no dilutive
effect on the earnings of the Company.


NOTE  16--SEGMENT  INFORMATION

The Company has two reported  segments:  Branch-based  Distribution and Digital.
The Branch-based Distribution segment provides customers with solutions to their
immediate  MRO  needs.  Branch-based  Distribution  is  an  aggregation  of  the
following  business   segments:   Grainger   Industrial  Supply,   Grainger.com,
Acklands-Grainger  Inc.,  Grainger Custom Solutions,  Grainger Export,  Grainger
Global  Sourcing,  Grainger Parts,  Grainger,  S.A. de C.V. and Puerto Rico. The
Digital  Business segment  provides  e-commerce  solutions to customers' MRO and
other  needs.  The Digital  segment is an  aggregation  of the  FindMRO.com  and
OrderZone.com  business segments.  The Grainger  Consulting  Services,  Grainger
Integrated Supply, and Lab Safety Supply, Inc. segments are included in Other.

The Company's  segments offer  differing  ranges of services and/or products and
require different  resources and marketing  strategies.  The Company's  segments
were initially formed in late 1997 as the Company  refocused its organization to
meet the diverse needs of its customers.  In late 1999, the Company modified its
segment  reporting to better reflect the current state of the business.  In 1997
the Company had one segment and the restatement of 1997 into comparable  segment
information is not practicable.

The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as those  described in the
summary of significant  accounting policies.  Intersegment  transfer prices were
established  at  external  selling  prices  less costs not  incurred  due to the
related party sale.




Following are  reconciliations of the segment  information with the consolidated
totals per the financial statements (in thousands of dollars).
