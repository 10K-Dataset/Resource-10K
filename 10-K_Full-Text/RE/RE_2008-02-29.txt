        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
        (“GAAP”). As used in this document, “Group” means Everest Re Group,
        Ltd. (formerly Everest Reinsurance Group, Ltd.); “Holdings” means Everest
        Reinsurance Holdings, Inc.; “Everest Re” means Everest Reinsurance Company and
        its subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise requires); and the “Company”

ITEM 1.
        BUSINESS

The
        Company.

Group, a
        Bermuda company, was established in 1999 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. On
        February 24, 2000, a corporate restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent
        holding company of Holdings. Holdings continues to be the holding company for the
        Company’s U.S. based operations. Holders of shares of common stock of Holdings
        automatically became holders of the same number of common shares of Group. Prior to the
        restructuring, Group had no significant assets or capitalization and had not engaged in any
        business or prior activities other than in connection with the restructuring.

In
        connection with the restructuring, Group established a Bermuda-based reinsurance
        subsidiary, Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda), Ltd. (“Bermuda Re”), which commenced
        business in the second half of 2000. Group also formed Everest Global Services, Inc., a
        Delaware subsidiary, to perform administrative and back-office functions for Group and its
        U.S. based and non-U.S. based subsidiaries.

Holdings, a Delaware corporation, was established in 1993 to serve as the
        parent holding company of Everest Re, a Delaware property and casualty reinsurer formed in
        1973. Until October 6, 1995, Holdings was an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The
        Prudential Insurance Company of America (“The Prudential”). On October 6, 1995,
        The Prudential sold its entire interest in the shares of common stock of Holdings in an
        initial public offering (the “IPO”).

The
        Company’s principal business, conducted through its operating segments, is the
        underwriting of reinsurance and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and international markets.
        The Company had gross written premiums in 2007 of $4.1 billion with approximately 78.3%
        representing reinsurance and 21.7% representing U.S. insurance. Shareholders’ equity
        at December 31, 2007 was $5.7 billion. The Company underwrites reinsurance both through
        brokers and directly with ceding companies, giving us the flexibility to pursue business
        based on the ceding company’s preferred reinsurance purchasing method. The Company
        underwrites insurance principally through general agent relationships and surplus lines
        brokers. Group’s active operating subsidiaries, excluding Mt. McKinley Insurance
        Company (“Mt. McKinley”), which is in run-off, are each rated A+
        (“Superior”) by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), a leading provider
        of insurer ratings that assigns financial strength ratings to insurance companies based on
        their ability to meet their obligations to policyholders.

Following is a summary of the Company’s principal operating
        subsidiaries:

                        Everest Re. Bermuda Re’s UK branch provides property and casualty
                        reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets. At December 31,

                        Re.

•

Everest Indemnity Insurance Company (“Everest

                        on a non-admitted basis. Excess and surplus lines insurance is specialty

                        insurance in a particular jurisdiction is permitted to provide to insureds
                        when the specific specialty coverage is unavailable from admitted insurers.
                        Everest Indemnity is licensed in Delaware and is eligible to write business
                        on a non-admitted basis in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto

                        Georgia and Alabama. The majority of Everest Security’s business is
                        reinsured by its parent, Everest Re.

•

Mt. McKinley, a Delaware insurance company and a direct
                        subsidiary of Holdings, was acquired by Holdings in September 2000 from The
                        Prudential. In 1985, Mt. McKinley ceased writing new and renewal insurance
                        and commenced a run-off operation to service claims arising from its
                        previously written business. Effective September 19, 2000, Mt. McKinley and
                        Bermuda Re entered into a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement,
                        whereby Mt. McKinley transferred, for arm’s-length consideration, all
                        of its net insurance exposures and reserves to Bermuda Re.

Reinsurance Industry Overview.

Reinsurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company, the reinsurer,
        agrees to indemnify another insurance company, the ceding company, against all or a portion
        of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more insurance
        contracts. Reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits, including a
        reduction in net liability on individual risks or classes of risks, catastrophe protection
        from large or multiple losses and assistance in maintaining acceptable financial ratios.
        Reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by
        permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be possible without
        a concomitant increase in capital and surplus. Reinsurance, however, does not discharge the
        ceding company from its liability to policyholders.

There
        are two basic types of reinsurance arrangements: treaty and facultative reinsurance. In
        treaty reinsurance, the ceding company is obligated to cede and the reinsurer is obligated
        to assume a specified portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company.
        Treaty reinsurers do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under
        their treaties: instead, the reinsurer relies upon the pricing and underwriting decisions
        made by the ceding company. In facultative reinsurance, the ceding company cedes and the
        reinsurer


assumes all or part of the risk under a single insurance
        contract. Facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each insurance contract that
        is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance, when purchased by ceding companies, usually is
        intended to cover individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties because of the
        dollar limits involved or because the risk is unusual.

Both
        treaty and facultative reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess
        of loss basis. Under pro rata reinsurance, the ceding company and the reinsurer share the
        premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion. Under excess of loss
        reinsurance, the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified
        portion of losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount, known as the ceding
        company's retention or reinsurer's attachment point, generally subject to a negotiated
        reinsurance contract limit.

In pro
        rata reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission. The
        ceding commission generally is based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the
        business being reinsured (commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous
        administrative expense). Premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of
        loss reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company
        receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk. There is usually no
        ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance.

Reinsurers may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure.
        Reinsurance of a reinsurer's business is called a retrocession. Reinsurance companies cede
        risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers, known as retrocessionaires, for
        reasons similar to those that cause insurers to purchase reinsurance: to reduce net
        liability on individual or classes of risks, protect against catastrophic losses, stabilize
        financial ratios and obtain additional underwriting capacity.

Reinsurance can be written through intermediaries, generally professional
        reinsurance brokers, or directly with ceding companies. From a ceding company's
        perspective, both the broker and the direct distribution channels have advantages and
        disadvantages. A ceding company's decision to select one distribution channel over the
        other will be influenced by its perception of such advantages and disadvantages relative to
        the reinsurance coverage being placed.

Business Strategy.

The
        Company’s business strategy is to sustain its leadership position within its target
        reinsurance and insurance markets, provide effective management throughout the property and
        casualty underwriting cycle and achieve an attractive return for its shareholders. The
        Company’s underwriting strategies seek to capitalize on its i) financial strength and
        capacity, ii) global franchise, iii) stable and experienced management team, iv)
        diversified product and distribution offering, v) underwriting expertise and disciplined
        approach, vi) efficient and low-cost operating structure and vii) prudent enterprise risk
        management practices.

The
        Company offers treaty and facultative reinsurance and admitted and non-admitted insurance.
        The Company’s products include the full range of property and casualty reinsurance
        and insurance coverages, including marine, aviation, surety, errors and omissions liability
        (“E&O”), directors’ and officers’ liability
        (“D&O”), medical malpractice, other specialty lines, accident and health
        (“A&H”) and workers’ compensation. The Company distributes its
        products through direct and broker reinsurance channels in U.S., Bermuda and international
        markets.

The
        Company’s underwriting strategy emphasizes underwriting profitability over premium
        volume. Key elements of this strategy include careful risk selection, appropriate pricing
        through strict underwriting discipline and adjustment of the Company’s business mix
        to respond to changing market conditions. The Company focuses on reinsuring companies that
        effectively manage the underwriting cycle through proper analysis and


pricing
        of underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and performance are compatible with
        its objectives.

The
        Company’s underwriting strategy emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to changing
        market conditions, such as increased demand or favorable pricing trends. The Company
        believes that its existing strengths, including its broad underwriting expertise, global
        presence, strong financial ratings and substantial capital, facilitate adjustments to its
        mix of business geographically, by line of business and by type of coverage, allowing it to
        participate in those market opportunities that provide the greatest potential for
        underwriting profitability. The Company’s insurance operations complement these
        strategies by providing access to business that is not available on a reinsurance basis.
        The Company carefully monitors its mix of business across all operations to avoid
        unacceptable geographic or other risk concentrations.

Marketing.

The
        Company writes business on a worldwide basis for many different customers and lines of
        business, thereby obtaining a broad spread of risk. The Company is not substantially
        dependent on any single customer, small group of customers, line of business or geographic
        area. For the 2007 calendar year, no single customer (ceding company or insured) generated
        more than 8.2% of the Company’s gross written premiums. The Company does not believe
        that a reduction of business from any one customer would have a material adverse effect on
        its future financial condition or results of operations.

Approximately 67%, 10% and 23% of the Company’s 2007 gross written
        premiums were written in the broker reinsurance, direct reinsurance and insurance markets,
        respectively. The Company’s ability to write reinsurance both through brokers and
        directly with ceding companies gives it the flexibility to write business based on the
        ceding company’s preferred reinsurance purchasing method.

The
        broker reinsurance market consists of several substantial national and international
        brokers and a number of smaller specialized brokers. Brokers do not have the authority to
        bind the Company with respect to reinsurance agreements, nor does the Company commit in
        advance to accept any portion of a broker’s submitted business. Reinsurance business
        from any ceding company, whether new or renewal, is subject to acceptance by the Company.
        Brokerage fees are generally paid by reinsurers. The Company’s ten largest brokers
        accounted for an aggregate of approximately 58% of gross written premiums in 2007, with the
        two largest brokers accounting for approximately 15% (Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.)
        and 14% (Willis Group, Ltd.) of gross written premiums. The Company does not believe that a
        reduction of business assumed from any one broker would have a materially adverse effect on
        the Company.

The
        direct reinsurance market remains an important distribution channel for reinsurance
        business written by the Company. Direct placement of reinsurance enables the Company to
        access clients who prefer to place their reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon
        the reinsurer’s in-depth understanding of the ceding company’s
        needs.

The
        Company’s insurance business is written principally through general agents and
        surplus lines brokers. In 2007, C.V. Starr accounted for approximately 6% of the
        Company’s gross written premium. No other single general agent generated more than 5%
        of the Company’s gross written premiums.

The
        Company continually evaluates each business relationship, including the underwriting
        expertise and experience brought to bear through the involved distribution channel,
        performs analyses to evaluate financial security, monitors performance and adjusts
        underwriting decisions accordingly.


Segment Results.

The
        Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S.
        Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance
        operation writes property and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis,
        through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The
        U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general
        agents and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation
        writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through
        brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation writes non-U.S.
        property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re’s branches in Canada and
        Singapore and offices in Miami and New Jersey. The Bermuda operation provides insurance and
        reinsurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to the United
        Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch.

These
        segments are managed in a coordinated fashion with respect to pricing, risk management,
        control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations.
        Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating
        segments based upon their underwriting results.

Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and loss adjustment
        expenses (“LAE”) incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other
        underwriting expenses. Underwriting results are measured using ratios, in particular loss,
        commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which respectively, divide
        incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by earned
        premium. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance, although such reinsurance does
        not materially impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment
        in which the business was first produced. For selected financial information regarding
        these segments, see Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Segment
        Results in ITEM 7.


Underwriting Operations.

The
        following five year table presents the distribution of the Company’s gross written
        premiums by its segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting,
        International and Bermuda. The premiums for each segment are further split between property
        and casualty business and, for reinsurance business, between pro rata or excess of loss
        business:


U.S.
        Reinsurance Segment.

The Company’s U.S. Reinsurance segment
        writes property and casualty reinsurance, both treaty and facultative, through reinsurance
        brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The Company targets
        certain brokers and, through the broker market, specialty companies and small to medium
        sized standard lines companies. The Company also targets companies that place their
        business predominantly in the direct market, including small to medium sized regional
        ceding companies, and seeks to develop long-term relationships with those companies. In
        addition, the U.S. Reinsurance segment writes portions of reinsurance programs for large,
        national insurance companies.

In 2007,
        $714.2 million of gross written premiums were attributable to U.S. treaty property
        business, of which 63.8% was written on a pro rata basis and 36.2% was written on an excess
        of loss basis. The Company’s property underwriters utilize sophisticated underwriting
        methods to analyze and price property business. The Company manages its exposures to
        catastrophe and other large losses by limiting exposures on individual contracts and
        limiting aggregate exposures to catastrophes in any particular zone and across contiguous
        zones.

U.S.
        treaty casualty business accounted for $334.0 million of gross written premiums in 2007, of
        which 64.8% was written on a pro rata basis and 35.2% was written on an excess of loss
        basis. The treaty casualty business consists of professional liability, D&O liability,
        workers’ compensation, excess and surplus lines and other liability coverages. As a
        result of the complex technical nature of most of these risks, the Company’s casualty
        underwriters tend to specialize by line of business and work closely with the
        Company’s pricing actuaries.

The
        Company’s facultative unit conducts business both through brokers and directly with
        ceding companies, and consists of four underwriting units representing property, casualty,
        specialty and national brokerage lines of business. Business is written from a facultative
        headquarters office in New York and satellite offices in Chicago and Oakland. In 2007,
        $55.7 million, $65.2 million, $6.2 million and $18.2 million of gross written premiums were
        attributable to the property, casualty, specialty and national brokerage lines of business,
        respectively.

In 2007,
        89.4%, 7.4% and 3.2% of the U.S. Reinsurance segment’s gross written premiums were
        written in the broker reinsurance, direct reinsurance and insurance markets,
        respectively.

U.S.
        Insurance Segment.

In 2007, the Company’s U.S. Insurance
        segment wrote $885.6 million of gross written premiums, of which 90.3% was casualty and
        9.7% was property. Of the total business written, Everest National wrote $571.1 million and
        Everest Re wrote $98.6 million, principally targeting commercial property and casualty
        business written through general agents with program administrators. Workers’
        compensation business accounted for $224.9 million, or 25.4% of the total business written,
        including $133.1 million, or 59.2%, of workers’ compensation business written in
        California. Non-workers’ compensation business represented $660.7 million, or 74.6%
        of the total business written. Everest Indemnity wrote $192.4 million, principally excess
        and surplus lines insurance business written through surplus lines brokers. Everest
        Security wrote $23.5 million, principally non-standard auto insurance written through
        retail agents. With respect to insurance written through general agents and surplus lines
        brokers, the Company supplements the initial underwriting process with periodic claims,
        underwriting and operational reviews and ongoing monitoring.

Specialty Underwriting Segment.

The
        Company’s Specialty Underwriting segment writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety
        reinsurance. The A&H unit primarily focuses on health reinsurance of traditional
        indemnity plans, self-insured health plans, accident coverages and specialty medical plans.
        The marine and aviation unit focuses on ceding companies with a particular expertise in
        marine and aviation business. The marine and aviation business is written primarily through
        brokers and contains a significant international component written primarily through the
        London market. Surety business underwritten by the Company consists mainly of reinsurance
        of contract surety bonds.

In 2007,
        gross written premiums of the A&H unit totaled $95.5 million, primarily written through
        brokers.


The
        marine and aviation unit’s 2007 gross written premiums totaled $128.6 million,
        substantially all of which was written on a treaty basis and sourced through reinsurance
        brokers. Marine treaties represented 77.7% of marine and aviation gross written premiums in
        2007 and consisted mainly of hull and energy coverage. Approximately 57.6% of the marine
        unit’s premiums in 2007 were written on a pro rata basis and 42.4% on an excess of
        loss basis. Aviation premiums accounted for 22.3% of marine and aviation gross written
        premiums in 2007 and included reinsurance for airlines and general aviation. Approximately
        82.2% of the aviation unit's premiums in 2007 was written on a pro rata basis and 17.8% on
        an excess of loss basis.

In 2007,
        gross written premiums of the surety unit totaled $45.9 million, 94.4% of which was written
        on a pro rata basis. Most of the portfolio is reinsurance of contract surety bonds written
        directly with ceding companies, with the remainder being trade credit reinsurance, mostly
        in international markets.

International Segment.

The Company’s
        International segment focuses on opportunities in the international reinsurance markets.
        The Company targets several international markets, including: Canada, with a branch in
        Toronto; Asia, with a branch in Singapore; and Latin America, Africa and the Middle East,
        which business is serviced from Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices. The
        Company also writes from New Jersey “home-foreign” business, which provides
        reinsurance on the international portfolios of U.S. insurers. Approximately 82.5% of the
        Company’s 2007 international gross written premiums represented property business,
        while 17.5% represented casualty business. As with its U.S. operations, the Company’s
        International segment focuses on financially sound companies that have strong management
        and underwriting discipline and expertise. Approximately 73.8% of the Company’s
        international business was written through brokers, with 26.2% written directly with ceding
        companies.

Gross
        written premiums of the Company’s Canadian branch totaled $169.9 million in 2007 and
        consisted of 29.7% of pro rata property business, 24.8% of excess property business, 13.9%
        of pro rata casualty business and 31.6% of excess casualty business. Approximately 76.6% of
        the Canadian premiums consisted of treaty reinsurance, while 23.4% was facultative
        reinsurance.

The
        Company’s Singapore branch covers the Asian markets and accounted for $165.3 million
        of gross written premiums in 2007 and consisted of 60.7% of pro rata property business,
        33.5% of excess property business, 3.5% of pro rata casualty business and 2.3% of excess
        casualty business.

International business written out of Everest Re’s Miami and New
        Jersey offices accounted for $470.7 million of gross written premiums in 2007 and consisted
        of 63.9% of pro rata treaty property business, 8.3% of pro rata treaty casualty business,
        18.0% of excess treaty property business, 3.1% of excess treaty casualty business and 6.7%
        of facultative property and casualty business. Of this international business, 59.1% was
        sourced from Latin America, 23.8% was sourced from the Middle East, 8.2% was
        “home-foreign” business, 7.7% was sourced from Africa, 1.1% was sourced from
        Asia and 0.1% was sourced from Europe.

Bermuda Segment.

The Company’s Bermuda
        segment writes property and casualty insurance and reinsurance through Bermuda Re and
        property and casualty reinsurance through its UK branch. In 2007, Bermuda Re had gross
        property and casualty written premiums of $327.8 million accounting for virtually all of
        its business, of which $305.9 million, or 93.4%, was treaty reinsurance; $21.3 million, or
        6.5%, was facultative reinsurance or individual risk insurance and $0.6 million was sourced
        from Belgium.

In 2007,
        the UK branch of Bermuda Re wrote $594.7 million of gross treaty reinsurance premium
        consisting of 37.8% of pro rata property business, 20.7% of excess property business, 25.4%
        of pro rata casualty business and 16.1% of excess casualty business.

Geographic Areas.

The Company conducts its
        business in Bermuda, the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. For select financial
        information about geographic areas, see Note 20 of Notes to the Consolidated
        Financial


Statements. Risks attendant to the foreign operations of the Company
        parallel those attendant to the U.S. operations of the Company, with the primary exception
        of foreign exchange risks. For more information about the risks, see ITEM 7,
        “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations – Safe Harbor Disclosure”.

Underwriting.

The
        Company’s ability to write both property and casualty risks allows it to underwrite
        entire contracts or major portions thereof that might otherwise need to be syndicated among
        several reinsurers. The Company’s strategy is to "lead" in as many of the reinsurance
        treaties it underwrites as possible. The lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one
        of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to
        negotiate price, terms and conditions. Management believes this strategy enables it to
        obtain more favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates. When
        the Company does not lead the treaty, it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the
        treaty. The Company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all
        relevant factors.

The
        Company’s treaty underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among the
        Company’s underwriters, actuaries and claim staff. Treaties are reviewed for
        compliance with the Company’s general underwriting standards and certain larger
        treaties are evaluated, in part, based upon actuarial analyses by the Company. The
        actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the subject exposures
        and loss experience. The Company does not separately evaluate each of the individual risks
        assumed under its treaties. The Company does, however, evaluate the underwriting guidelines
        of its ceding companies to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty. The
        Company, when appropriate, also conducts underwriting, operational and claim audits at the
        offices of ceding companies to monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines. Underwriting
        audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff, pricing and risk selection and rate
        monitoring over time. Claim audits, when appropriate, are performed in order to evaluate
        the client’s claims handling abilities and practices.

The
        Company’s facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable
        types of risks, limits and maximum risk exposures. Specified classes of large premium U.S.
        risks are referred to Everest Re’s New York facultative headquarters for specific
        review before premium quotations are given to clients. In addition, the Company’s
        guidelines require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their
        aggregate limits, complexity or volatility, regardless of premium amount on the underlying
        contract. Non-U.S. risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers
        within the involved operations.

The
        Company’s insurance operations principally write casualty coverages for homogeneous
        risks through select program managers. These programs are evaluated based upon actuarial
        analysis and the program manager’s capabilities. The Company’s rates, forms and
        underwriting guidelines are tailored to specific risk types. The Company’s
        underwriting, actuarial, claim and financial functions work closely with its program
        managers to establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as
        appropriate performance monitoring mechanisms.

Risk
        Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements

Underwriting Risk and Accumulation
        Controls.

Each segment and business unit manages its underwriting
        risk in accordance with established guidelines. These guidelines place dollar limits on the
        amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors, including ceding
        company profile, line of business, geographic location and risk hazards. In each case, the
        guidelines permit limited exceptions, which must be authorized by the Company’s
        senior management. Management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to
        changes in business unit market conditions, risk versus reward analyses and the
        Company’s underwriting risk management processes.


The
        operating results and financial condition of the Company can be adversely affected by
        catastrophe and other large losses. The Company manages its exposure to catastrophes and
        other large losses by:

•

selective underwriting practices;

•

diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by
                        types and classes of business;

•

limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any
                        particular geographic zone and contiguous zones;

•

purchasing retrocessional protection to the extent that such
                        coverage can be secured cost-effectively. See “Retrocession
                        Arrangements”.

Like
        other insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured
        losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or
        an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. A large
        catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance
        treaties, facultative certificates and across lines of business.

The
        Company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event or series of
        events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic
        events. Accordingly, the Company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss
        it could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These
        techniques range from non-modeled deterministic approaches, such as tracking aggregate
        limits exposed in catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic damage factors, to modeled
        approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated Monte Carlo
        simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a
        probabilistic basis.

No
        single universal model is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of
        loss in all global geographic regions in which the Company conducts business. In addition,
        the form, quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding
        companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the Company’s
        licensed models, which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections.
        Further, the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and
        interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units. The combination of
        techniques potentially adds to the imprecision of the Company’s estimates. Also,
        while most models have been updated to better incorporate factors that contributed to
        unprecedented industry storm losses in 2004 and 2005, such as flood, storm surge and demand
        surge, catastrophe model projections are inherently imprecise. In addition, uncertainties
        with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant
        uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity
        data.

Nevertheless, when combined with traditional risk management techniques and
        sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price
        catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with
        which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for
        individual and multiple events.

Projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the
        probable maximum loss (“PML”). The Company defines PML as its anticipated loss,
        taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a
        broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake. The PML
        will vary depending upon the severity of modeled simulated losses and the make-up of the in
        force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of
        “return periods”, such as “100-year events” and “250-year
        events”. For example, a 100-year PML corresponds to the estimated loss from a single
        event which has a 1% probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period. Conversely, it
        corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the
        indicated PML. It is important to note that PMLs are estimates. Modeled events are
        hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model. As a result, there can be


no
        assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses
        from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event
        PML.

From an
        enterprise risk management perspective, management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe
        loss exposure the Company may underwrite. The limits are revised periodically based on a
        variety of factors, including but not limited to the Company’s financial resources
        and expected earnings and risk/reward analyses of the business being
        underwritten.

As of
        January 1, 2008, management estimated that the projected economic loss from its largest
        100-year event does not exceed $600 million or about 10% of shareholders’ equity.
        Economic loss is the gross PML reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew
        coverage and income taxes. The impact of income taxes on the PML depends on the
        distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate
        reinsurance. Management also monitors and controls its largest PMLs at multiple points
        along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and
        1,000 year return periods. This process enables management to identify and control exposure
        accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk, underwriting and
        capital management decisions.

The
        Company’s catastrophe loss projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated
        quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process. The table below
        reflects the Company’s pre-tax PMLs at various return times for its top three
        zones/perils (as ranked by the largest 1 in 100 year events) based on loss projection data
        as of January 1, 2008:

The
        Company purchases limited amounts of retrocessional coverage. While the Company considers
        purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection by evaluating the underlying exposures
        in comparison to the availability of cost-effective protection, there was no such
        retrocessional coverage in place at January 1, 2008. The Company continues to evaluate the
        availability and cost of various retrocessional products and loss mitigation approaches in
        the marketplace.

The
        projected economic losses for the three highest 1 in 100 PML losses in the above table are
        as follows: for the Southeast U.S. wind storm, $564 million; for the European wind storm,
        $399 million and for the Northeast U.S. wind storm, $318 million. The projection for the
        Southeast wind storm does not consider potential impacts from the Florida insurance reform
        that increases insurers’ access to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, thus
        potentially reducing the amount of reinsurance purchased from the private reinsurance
        markets. The Company is unable to predict if this will reduce future reinsurance coverage
        in Florida and correspondingly reduce the PML for a Southeast wind storm.

The
        Company believes that its methods of monitoring, analyzing and managing catastrophe
        exposures provide a credible risk management framework, which can be integrated with its
        underwriting business and capital management activities. However, there is much uncertainty
        and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation
        process generally. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company will not
        experience losses from individual events that exceed the PML or other return period
        projections, perhaps by a material amount. Nor can there be assurance that the Company will
        not experience events


impacting multiple zones, or multiple severe events that could, in the
        aggregate, exceed the Company’s PML expectations by a significant amount.

Terrorism Risk.

The Company does not have
        significant exposure to losses from terrorism risk. While the Company writes some
        reinsurance contracts covering events of terrorism, the Company’s risk management
        philosophy is to limit the amount of coverage provided and specifically not provide
        terrorism coverage for properties or in areas that may be considered a target for
        terrorists. Although providing terrorism coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable,
        most insurance policies mandate inclusion of terrorism coverage. As a result, the Company
        is exposed to losses from terrorism on its U.S. insurance book of business, particularly
        its workers’ compensation policies; however, the Company generally does not insure
        large corporations or corporate locations that represent large concentrations of
        risk.

As a
        result of its limited exposure, the Company does not believe the U.S. Terrorism Risk
        Insurance Act of 2002 that was signed into law November 2002 and amended in December 2005
        and December 2007 has had or will have a significant impact on its operations.

Retrocession Arrangements.

The Company
        considers retrocessional agreements to reduce its exposure on specific business written and
        potential accumulations of exposures across some or all of the Company’s operations.
        Where reinsurance is purchased, the agreements provide for recovery of a portion of losses
        and LAE from retrocessionaires. The level of retrocessional coverage varies over time,
        reflecting the underwriter’s and/or Company’s view of the changing dynamics of
        both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets. All retrocessional purchasing
        decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the
        pricing, terms, conditions and availability of such coverage, with the aim of securing
        cost-effective protection. No assurance can be given that the Company will seek or be able
        to obtain retrocessional coverage in the future similar to that in place currently or in
        the past.

The
        Company does not typically purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific
        reinsurance business written, but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent
        and/or cost-effective to reinsure a portion of the specific risks being assumed. The
        Company also participates in “common account” retrocessional arrangements for
        certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit
        of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties. Common account
        retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all
        participating companies, including the ceding company, with respect to the involved
        treaties.

The
        Company typically considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program
        exposures written by the U.S. Insurance segment. The type of reinsurance coverage
        considered is dependent upon individual risk exposures, individual program exposures,
        aggregate exposures by line of business, overall segment exposures and the cost
        effectiveness of available reinsurance. Facultative reinsurance will typically be
        considered for large individual exposures and quota share reinsurance will generally be
        considered for entire programs of business.

The
        Company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the
        potential accumulation of exposures. Such consideration includes balancing the underlying
        exposures against the availability of cost-effective retrocessional protection. For years
        ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate
        excess of loss retrocession coverage that provided up to $175 million of coverage for each
        year. These excess of loss policies provided coverage if Everest Re’s consolidated
        statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a specified attachment point for each
        year of coverage. The attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included
        adjustable premium provisions that effectively caused the Company to offset, on a pre-tax
        income basis, up to approximately 57% of such ceded losses. The maximum recovery for each
        year was $175 million before giving effect to the adjustable premium and the Company had
        ceded the maximum limits under all three contracts. The Company has not purchased similar
        corporate level coverage subsequent to December 31, 2001.


All of
        the Company’s retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and
        therefore, are accounted for as reinsurance under Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards (“FAS”) No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of
        Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts”.

In
        connection with the Company’s acquisition of Mt. McKinley in September 2000, the
        Company obtained coverage under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided
        by Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company of Indiana (“Prupac”), a
        wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential. On October 31, 2003, LM Property & Casualty
        Insurance Company (“LM”) completed its purchase of Prupac and its obligations
        from The Prudential. The Prudential continues to guarantee LM’s obligation under this
        agreement. This agreement covers 80%, or $160 million, of the first $200 million of any
        adverse loss reserve development on the carried reserves of Mt. McKinley at the date of
        acquisition and reimburses the Company as such losses are paid by the Company. Cessions
        under this reinsurance agreement had exhausted the limit available under the contract as of
        December 31, 2003.

At
        December 31, 2007, the Company carried as an asset $666.2 million in reinsurance
        receivables with respect to losses ceded. Of this amount, $176.1 million, or 26.4%, was
        receivable from Transatlantic Reinsurance Company (“Transatlantic”); $152.1
        million, or 22.8%, was receivable from Founders Insurance Company Limited
        (“Founders”), for which the Company has established $151.4 million provision
        for uncollectible reinsurance; $100.0 million, or 15.0%, was receivable from Continental
        Insurance Company ("Continental"); $54.6 million, or 8.2%, was receivable from Munich
        Reinsurance Company (“Munich Re”); $45.4 million, or 6.8%, was receivable from
        LM; $38.5 million, or 5.8%, was receivable from ACE Property and Casualty Insurance Company
        (“Ace”) and $37.7 million, or 5.7%, was receivable from Berkley Insurance
        Company (“Berkley”). No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of
        the Company’s receivables. Although management carefully selects its reinsurers, the
        Company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of
        risk to reinsurers does not relieve the Company of its liability to insureds or ceding
        companies. See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
        Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition”.

The
        Company’s arrangements with Continental are managed on a funds held basis, which
        means that the Company has retained the premiums earned by the retrocessionaire to secure
        obligations of the retrocessionaire, recorded them as a liability, credited interest on the
        balances at a stated contractual rate and reduced the liability account as payments become
        due. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, such funds had reduced the Company’s net
        exposure to Continental to $27.1 million and $33.2 million, respectively.

Claims.

Reinsurance claims are managed by the Company’s professional claims
        staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues,
        monitoring claims handling activities of ceding companies, establishing and adjusting
        proper case reserves and approving payment of claims. In addition to claims assessment,
        processing and payment, the claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of
        both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding
        companies. Insurance claims, except those relating to Mt. McKinley’s business, are
        generally handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and
        are subject to oversight by the Company’s professional claims staff.

The
        Company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental (“A&E”)
        exposures through dedicated, centrally managed claim staffs for Mt. McKinley and Everest
        Re. Both are staffed with experienced claim and legal professionals who specialize in the
        handling of such exposures. These units actively manage each individual insured and
        reinsured account, responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved
        exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate. Specific or general claim developments
        that may have material implications for the Company are regularly communicated to senior
        management, actuarial, legal and financial areas. Senior management and claim management
        personnel meet at least quarterly to review the Company’s overall reserve positions
        and make changes, if appropriate. The Company continually reviews its


internal
        processing, communications and analytics, seeking to enhance the management of its A&E
        exposures, in particular in regard to changes in asbestos claims and litigation.

Reserves for Unpaid Property and Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment
        Expenses.

Significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured
        loss, the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment of that
        loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer. To recognize
        liabilities for unpaid losses and LAE, insurers and reinsurers establish reserves, which
        are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay
        reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred.
        Actual losses and LAE paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves. To the
        extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and LAE after taking into
        account available reinsurance coverage, the Company would have to recognize such reserve
        shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings, which could be material in the period such
        recognition takes place. See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
        Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Loss and LAE
        Reserves”.

As part
        of the reserving process, insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and
        make judgments as to the impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial
        developments that may affect future claim amounts, changes in social and political
        attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends.
        While the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies, the
        inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer, due
        primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any
        attendant claims to the reinsurer, the diversity of development patterns among different
        types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts, the necessary reliance on the
        ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving
        practices among ceding companies. In addition, trends that have affected development of
        liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the
        same manner or to the same degree in the future. As a result, actual losses and LAE may
        deviate, perhaps substantially, from estimates of reserves reflected in the Company's
        consolidated financial statements.

Like
        many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company has
        experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years, which has led to increases
        in losses and LAE reserves and corresponding charges to income in the periods in which the
        adjustments were made. There can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years
        will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material
        adverse effect on net income.

Changes in Historical Reserves.

The
        following table shows changes in historical loss reserves for the Company for 1997 and
        subsequent years. The table is presented on a GAAP basis except that the Company’s
        loss reserves for its Canadian branch operations are presented in Canadian dollars, the
        impact of which is not material. The top line of the table shows the estimated initial
        reserves for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at each year end date. The upper (paid) portion
        of the table presents the related cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year end.
        The lower (liability re-estimated) portion shows the re-estimated amount of the previously
        recorded reserves as of the end of each succeeding year. The reserve estimates are revised
        as more information becomes known about the actual claims for which the initial reserves
        were carried. The cumulative deficiency line represents the cumulative change in estimates
        since the initial reserve was established. It is equal to the initial reserve less the
        latest estimate of the ultimate liability.

Since
        the Company has international operations, some of its loss reserves are established in
        foreign currencies and converted to U.S. dollars for financial reporting. Changes in
        conversion rates from period to period impact the U.S. dollar value of carried reserves and
        correspondingly, the cumulative deficiency line of the table. However, unlike other reserve
        development that affects net income, the impact of currency translation is a component of
        other comprehensive income. To differentiate these two reserve development components,
        the


translation impacts for each calendar year are reflected in the table of
        Effects on Pre-tax Income Resulting from Reserve Re-estimates.

Each
        amount other than the original reserves in the top half of the table below includes the
        effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. For example, if a loss settled in 2000
        for $100,000, was first reserved in 1997 at $60,000 and remained unchanged until
        settlement, the $40,000 deficiency (actual loss minus original estimate) would affect the
        cumulative deficiency for each of the years in the period 1997 through 1999. Conditions and
        trends that have affected development of the ultimate liability in the past are not
        indicative of future developments. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future
        redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.


Every
        year in the above table reflects a cumulative deficiency, also referred to as adverse
        development, with the largest indicated cumulative deficiency in 2001. Three classes of
        business were the principal contributors to those deficiencies: 1) the run-off of asbestos
        claims for both direct and reinsurance business has significantly contributed to the
        cumulative deficiencies for all years presented; 2) professional liability reinsurance,
        general casualty reinsurance and workers’ compensation insurance contributed to the
        deficiencies for years 1999 through 2003; and 3) property catastrophe adverse development
        contributed to the deficiency for 2005.

In
        response to its recent asbestos experience, and in view of industry asbestos experience,
        the Company completed a detailed study of its experience and its cedants’ exposures
        and also considered recent industry trends. The Company’s Claims Department undertook
        a contract by contract analysis of its direct business and projected those findings to its
        assumed reinsurance business. The Company’s actuaries utilized nine methodologies to
        project its potential ultimate liabilities including projections based on internal data and
        assessments, extrapolations of non-public and publicly available data for the
        Company’s cedants and benchmarking against industry data and experience. As a result
        of this study, the Company increased its gross reinsurance asbestos reserves by $250.0
        million and increased its gross direct asbestos reserves by $75.0 million in the fourth
        quarter of 2007. These reserve increases, as well as adverse development on asbestos in
        prior years, have a significant impact on the cumulative deficiencies. Absent the asbestos
        development, only years 2000 through 2003 would reflect cumulative deficiencies on net
        reserves, with the remaining years reflecting cumulative redundancies.

In the
        professional liability reinsurance class, the late 1990s and early 2000s saw a
        proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other corporate, financial and/or
        management improprieties. This resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of
        claims under the professional liability policies reinsured by the Company. In the general
        casualty area, the Company has experienced claim frequency and severity greater than
        expected in the Company’s pricing and reserving assumptions, particularly for
        accident years 1999 and 2000.

In the
        workers’ compensation insurance class, the majority of which was written in
        California, the Company has experienced adverse development primarily for accident years
        2001 and 2002 due to higher than expected claim frequency and severity. As a result of
        significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment, the
        Company’s writings in this class were subject to more relative variability than in
        some of its established and/or stable lines of business. Although cumulative results
        through 2007 continue to be quite profitable for this book of business, there has been some
        deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years 2001 and
        2002.

Management believes that adequate provision has been made for the
        Company’s loss and LAE reserves. While there can be no assurance that these reserves
        will not need to be increased in the future, management believes that the Company’s
        existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases
        would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of
        operations or cash flows. These statements regarding the Company’s loss reserves are
        forward looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws and are
        intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein. See ITEM 7,
        “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations – Safe Harbor Disclosure”.


The
        following table is derived from the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table above and
        summarizes the effect of reserve re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year
        operations by accident year for the same ten year period ended December 31, 2007. Each
        column represents the amount of net reserve re-estimates made in the indicated calendar
        year and shows the accident years to which the re-estimates are applicable. The amounts in
        the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve
        re-estimates for the indicated accident years.

Since
        the Company has operations in many countries, part of the Company’s loss and LAE
        reserves are in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for each reporting
        period. Fluctuations in the exchange rates for the currencies, period over period, affect
        the U.S. dollar amount of outstanding reserves. The translation adjustment line at the
        bottom of the table eliminates the impact of the exchange fluctuations from the reserve
        re-estimates.

Some totals may not reconcile due to rounding.

This adjustment converts Canadian dollars to U.S.
                        dollars.

The
        reserve development by accident year reflected in the above table was generally the result
        of the same factors described above that caused the deficiencies shown in the Ten Year GAAP
        Loss Development Table. The unfavorable development experienced in the 1997 and prior and
        2000 accident years relates principally to the previously discussed asbestos development.
        Other business areas contributing to adverse development were casualty reinsurance,
        including professional liability classes and workers’ compensation insurance, where,
        in retrospect, the Company’s initial estimates of losses were underestimated
        principally as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures. The
        favorable development for accident years 2002 through 2004 relates primarily to favorable
        experience with respect to property reinsurance business. In addition, casualty reinsurance
        has reflected favorable development for accident years 2003 to 2006. The unfavorable
        development experienced in the 2006 accident year was principally due to reserve increases
        for one credit insurance program.


The
        Company’s loss reserving methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and
        loss development trends, seeking, on a timely basis, to both adjust reserves for the impact
        of trend shifts and to factor the impact of such shifts into the Company’s
        underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis.

The
        following table presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve balances for the
        periods indicated on a GAAP basis:

Development of prior year incurred losses was $206.5 million unfavorable in
        2007, $135.6 million unfavorable in 2006 and $26.4 million favorable in 2005. Such losses
        were the result of the reserve development discussed above, as well as inherent uncertainty
        in establishing loss and LAE reserves.

Reserves for Asbestos and Environmental Losses and Loss Adjustment
        Expenses.

At
        December 31, 2007, 10.2% of the Company’s gross reserves reflected an estimate of the
        Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims for which ultimate value cannot be
        estimated using traditional reserving techniques. The Company’s A&E liabilities
        stem from Mt. McKinley’s direct insurance business and Everest Re’s assumed
        reinsurance business. There are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the
        Company’s potential losses from A&E claims. See ITEM 7, “Management’s
        Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Asbestos
        and Environmental Exposures” and Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements.

Mt.
        McKinley’s book of direct A&E exposed insurance is relatively small and
        homogenous. It also arises from a limited period, effective 1978 to 1984. The book is based
        principally on excess liability policies, thereby limiting exposure analysis to a limited
        number of policies and forms. As a result of this focused structure, the Company believes
        that it is able to comprehensively analyze its exposures, allowing it to identify, analyze
        and actively monitor those claims which have unusual exposure, including policies in which
        it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non-products asbestos
        claims.

The
        Company endeavors to be actively engaged with every insured account posing significant
        potential asbestos exposure to Mt. McKinley. Such engagement can take the form of pursuing
        a final settlement, negotiation, litigation, or the monitoring of claim activity under
        Settlement in Place (“SIP”) agreements. SIP agreements generally condition an
        insurer’s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual
        payment caps or other measures to control the insurer’s payments. The Company’s
        Mt. McKinley operation is currently managing eight SIP agreements, three of which were
        executed prior to the acquisition of Mt.


McKinley
        in 2000. The Company’s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute
        settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments, because such settlements eliminate
        future uncertainty.

The
        Company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure
        characteristics over time, as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be
        more exposed or active. Those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are
        subject to less rigorous, but still active management, with an emphasis on monitoring those
        characteristics, which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity. The
        Company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes
        used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders, including those that may not have
        reported significant A&E losses.

Everest
        Re’s book of assumed reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of
        A&E exposed relationships. It also arises from a limited period, effectively 1977 to
        1984. Because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the Company has been
        managing the A&E exposures for many years, its claim staff is familiar with the ceding
        companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore
        most likely to generate future liabilities. The Company’s claim staff has developed
        familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the
        claims handling and reserving practices of those companies. This level of familiarity
        enhances the quality of the Company’s analysis of its exposure through those
        companies. As a result, the Company believes that it can identify those claims on which it
        has unusual exposure, such as non-products asbestos claims, for concentrated attention.
        However, in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities, the Company relies on claims
        data supplied, both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers. This
        furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and
        timeliness of the Company’s ultimate loss projections.

The
        following table summarizes the composition of the Company’s total reserves for
        A&E losses, gross and net of reinsurance, for the periods indicated:

(1)

Additional reserves are case specific reserves determined by
                        the Company to be needed over and above those reported by the ceding
                        company.

Additional losses, including those relating to latent injuries and other
        exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen
        by either the Company or the industry, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence
        could have material adverse effects on the Company’s future financial condition,
        results of operations and cash flows.


Future Policy Benefit Reserves.

The
        Company writes a limited amount of life and annuity reinsurance in its Bermuda segment.
        Future policy benefit liabilities for annuities are reported at the accumulated fund
        balance of these contracts. Reserves for those liabilities include both mortality and
        morbidity provisions with respect to life and annuity claims, both reported and unreported.
        Actual experience in a particular period may be worse than assumedexperience and,
        consequently, may adversely affect the Company’s operating results for that period.
        See Note 1F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Activity
        in the reserve for future policy benefits is summarized for the periods
        indicated:

Investments.

The
        board of directors of each of the Company’s operating subsidiaries is responsible for
        establishing investment policy and guidelines and, together with senior management, for
        overseeing their execution.

The
        Company’s principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet
        its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while
        maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives,
        the Company views its investment portfolio as having two components; 1) the investments
        needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by the Company’s
        shareholders’ equity.

For
        outstanding liabilities, the Company invests in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income
        securities with an average credit quality of Aa, as rated by Moody’s Investors
        Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”). The Company’s mix of taxable and
        tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company’s
        current and projected operating results, market conditions and the Company’s tax
        position. This fixed maturity portfolio is externally managed by an independent,
        professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by the
        Company.

Over the
        past few years, the Company has reallocated its equity investment portfolio to include 1)
        publicly traded equity securities and 2) private equity limited partnership investments.
        The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total
        return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to
        higher return asset classes. The Company has limited its allocation to these asset classes
        because of 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these
        investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. At December 31, 2007,
        the market or fair value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities
        approximated 38% of shareholders’ equity.

The
        Company’s fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline of
        five to six years. The duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security
        but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments. This
        investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management, which
        considers economic and business factors, as well as the Company’s average duration of
        potential liabilities, which, at December 31, 2007, is estimated at approximately 3.8 years
        based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration
        calculations.


The
        duration of the fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2007 was 3.9 years, down from 4.1
        years at prior year end. This shortened duration mainly reflects the Company’s
        elevated short-term investment holdings in response to relatively low interest rates
        combined with a flat to negative yield curve during 2007.

For each
        currency in which the Company has established substantial reserves, the Company seeks to
        maintain invested assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately comparable
        to the estimated liabilities. Approximately 23% of the Company’s consolidated
        reserves for losses and LAE and unearned premiums represent estimated amounts payable in
        foreign currencies.

The
        Company’s overall financial strength and results of operations are, in part,
        dependent on the quality and performance of its investment portfolio. Net investment income
        and net realized capital gains (losses) on the Company’s invested assets constituted
        16.1%, 14.7% and 13.4% of the Company’s revenues for the years ended December 31,
        2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The
        increase in 2007 is primarily attributable to the Company’s adoption of fair value
        accounting for its actively managed equity security investment portfolio. Basically, fair
        value accounting reports changes in the value as realized capital gains or losses on the
        statement of operations rather than other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. The
        Company had $76.6 million, or 1.6% of the Company’s revenues, of fair value
        re-measurements included in net realized capital gains in 2007. The Company’s cash
        and invested assets totaled $14.9 billion at December 31, 2007, which consisted of 85.2%
        fixed maturities and cash of which 98.3% were investment grade, 10.4% equity securities and
        4.4% other invested assets. The average maturity of fixed maturities was 7.2 years at
        December 31, 2007, and their overall duration was 3.9 years.

At
        December 31, 2007, the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio included $25.9 million in
        book value of asset backed securities with sub-prime mortgage loan exposure. Sub-prime
        mortgage loans generally represent loans made to borrowers with limited or blemished credit
        records. At December 31, 2007 almost 100% of the Company’s asset backed securities
        with sub-prime exposure were investment grade and the market value of these
        investments was $25.4 million.

As of
        December 31, 2007, the Company did not have any direct investments in commercial real
        estate or direct commercial mortgages or any material holdings of derivative investments
        (other than equity index put options as discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated
        Financial Statements) or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash flow difficulty
        to an extent that the Company’s management believes could threaten the issuer’s
        ability to meet debt service payments, except where other than temporary impairments have
        been recognized.

As of
        December 31, 2007, the Company’s common stock portfolio, which is primarily comprised
        of actively managed equity securities, had a market value of $1,560.0 million, comprising
        10.4% of total investments and cash. As discussed above, in 2007, the Company adopted fair
        value accounting for its actively managed equity security portfolio.

        following table reflects investment results for the Company for the periods
        indicated:

The
        following tables summarize fixed maturities for the periods indicated:


The
        following table represents the credit quality distribution of the Company’s fixed
        maturities for the periods indicated:

The
        following table summarizes fixed maturities by contractual maturity for the period
        indicated:

(1)

Mortgage-backed securities generally are more likely to be
                        prepaid than other fixed maturities. Therefore, contractual maturities are
                        excluded from this table since they may not be indicative of actual
                        maturities.

Financial Strength Ratings.

The
        following table shows the current financial strength ratings of the Company’s
        operating subsidiaries as reported by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s Rating
        Services (“Standard & Poor’s”) and Moody’s. These ratings are
        based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be considered an indication
        of the degree or lack of risk involved in a direct or indirect equity investment in an
        insurance or reinsurance company.


All of
        the below-mentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised, if necessary, by each of
        the rating agencies.

The
        Company believes that its ratings, in general, have become increasingly important to its
        operations because they provide the Company’s customers and investors with an
        independent assessment of the Company’s underlying financial strength using a scale
        that provides for relative comparisons. Strong financial ratings are particularly important
        for reinsurance companies. Ceding companies must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered
        losses well into the future. As a result, a highly rated reinsurer is generally
        preferred.

A.M.
        Best states that the “A+” (“Superior”) rating is assigned to those
        companies which, in its opinion, have a superior ability to meet their ongoing obligations
        to policyholders based on A.M. Best’s comprehensive quantitative and qualitative
        evaluation of a company’s balance sheet strength, operating performance and business
        profile. Standard & Poor’s states that the “AA-” rating is assigned
        to those insurance companies which, in its opinion, have very strong financial security
        characteristics with respect to their ability to pay under its insurance policies and
        contracts in accordance with their terms. Moody’s states that insurance companies
        rated “Aa” offer excellent financial security. Together with the Aaa rated
        companies, Aa rated companies constitute what are generally known as high-grade companies,
        with Aa rated companies generally having somewhat larger long-term risks.

Subsidiaries other than Everest Re and Bermuda Re may not be rated by some
        or any rating agencies because such ratings are not considered essential by the individual
        subsidiary’s customers or because of the limited nature of the subsidiary’s
        operations. In particular, Mt. McKinley is not rated because it is in run-off
        status.

Debt
        Ratings.

The
        following table shows the debt ratings by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and
        Moody’s of the Holdings’ senior notes due March 15, 2010 and October 15, 2014
        and long term notes due May 1, 2067 and Everest Re Capital Trust II’s (“Capital
        Trust II”) trust preferred securities due March 29, 2034, all of which are considered
        investment grade. Debt ratings are a current assessment of the credit worthiness of an
        obligor with respect to a specific obligation.

A debt
        rating of “a” or “a-” is assigned by A.M. Best where the issuer, in
        A.M. Best’s opinion, has a strong ability to meet the terms of the obligation. A debt
        rating of “A-“ is assigned by Standard & Poor’s where the obligor has
        a strong capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation, although it is
        somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic
        conditions than obligations in higher rated categories. Standard & Poor’s assigns
        a debt rating of “BBB” to issues that exhibit adequate protection parameters
        although adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to
        lead


to a
        weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.
        According to Moody’s, a debt rating of “A3” is assigned to issues that
        are considered upper-medium-grade obligations and subject to low credit risk. Obligations
        rated “Baa1” are subject to moderate credit risk and are considered
        medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.

Competition.

The
        worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical
        by product and market. As a result, financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of
        constrained availability, high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant
        capacity, low rates and constrained profitability. Competition in the types of reinsurance
        and insurance business that the Company underwrites is based on many factors, including the
        perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer
        or insurer by A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor’s, underwriting expertise, the
        jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity
        and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and
        insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and
        experience in lines written. Furthermore, the market impact from these competitive factors
        related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business,
        domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels.

The
        Company competes in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets
        with numerous global competitors. The Company’s competitors include independent
        reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide
        insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic
        and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at
        Lloyd’s. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the Company
        and have established long term and continuing business relationships, which can be a
        significant competitive advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into
        the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance
        risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and
        insurance capacity and competition.

In 2007,
        the Company observed increased competition with slightly reduced rates, higher commissions
        and demands by cedants for improved terms and conditions. The extent of the increased
        competition and its effect on rates, terms and conditions varied widely by market and
        coverage types. One of the lesser impacted markets was property catastrophe retrocessional
        coverage in regions that were most affected by the catastrophe events of 2005, principally
        Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Reinsurance capacity in areas including southeastern
        U.S. exposures and energy lines continued to be constrained. In January 2007, the state of
        Florida passed legislation that increased coverage provided by the Florida Hurricane
        Catastrophe Fund, thus potentially reducing the amount of reinsurance that Florida
        companies will purchase from the private reinsurance market. In addition, the legislature
        broadened the mandate of the state sponsored homeowners’ insurance company to render
        it a fully competitive market participant. Although the Company is unable to predict the
        impact on future market conditions from the increased competition and legislative
        developments, the Company believes that its clients continue to write profitable business
        in Florida and will continue to purchase both quota share and catastrophe coverage,
        although at likely lower volumes. The balance of the U.S. and international property lines
        experienced mostly modest price declines but the Company believes they are still adequately
        priced.

The
        Company’s U.S. and international casualty lines experienced weaker market conditions,
        led by the medical stop loss and D&O reinsurance classes, as well as the California
        workers’ compensation insurance line. The Company believes that U.S. casualty
        reinsurance generally remains adequately priced. The Company also believes that increased
        primary price competition and cedants’ increased appetite for retaining more
        profitable business net, following several highly profitable years, have resulted in
        modestly softer, but still profitable,

reinsurance
        pricing. The Company’s U.S. insurance operation was also affected by these primary
        casualty insurance market conditions; however, given the specialty nature of the
        Company’s business, it believes the impact on the Company to be less severe than on
        the market generally.


The Company
        is unable to predict the impact on future market conditions from increased competition and
        legislative initiatives. In addition to these market forces, reinsurers continue to
        reassess their risk appetites and rebalance their property portfolios to obtain a greater
        spread of risk against the backdrop of: (i) recent revisions to the industry’s
        catastrophe loss projection models, which are indicating significantly higher loss
        potentials and consequently higher pricing requirements, and (ii) elevated rating agency
        scrutiny and capital requirements for many catastrophe exposed companies.

In light
        of the Company’s 2005 catastrophe experience, it has re-examined its risk management
        practices and concluded that the control framework operated generally as intended. The
        Company rebalanced its property portfolio, particularly within peak catastrophe zones,
        including the Southeast U.S., Mexico and Gulf of Mexico. This effort has enabled the
        Company to benefit from market dislocations by carefully shifting the mix of its writings
        toward the most profitable classes, lines, customers and territories and by enhancing its
        portfolio balance and diversification.

Overall,
        the Company believes that current marketplace conditions offer solid opportunities for it,
        given its strong ratings, distribution system, reputation and expertise. The Company
        continues to employ its strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit
        potential, while maintaining balance and diversification on its overall
        portfolio.

Employees.

As of
        February 1, 2008, the Company employed 779 persons. Management believes that employee
        relations are good. None of the Company’s employees are subject to collective
        bargaining agreements, and the Company is not aware of any current efforts to implement
        such agreements.

Regulatory Matters.

The
        Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance
        statutes of the various jurisdictions in which they conduct business, including essentially
        all states of the U.S., Canada, Singapore, the United Kingdom and Bermuda. These
        regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect
        ceding insurance companies and policyholders by regulating the Company’s conduct of
        business, financial integrity and ability to meet its obligations. Many of these
        regulations require reporting of information designed to allow insurance regulators to
        closely monitor the Company’s performance.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation.

Under
        applicable U.S. laws and regulations, no person, corporation or other entity may acquire a
        controlling interest in the Company, unless such person, corporation or entity has obtained
        the prior approval for such acquisition from the insurance commissioners of Delaware and
        the other states in which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or
        deemed domiciled, currently California and Georgia. Under these laws, “control”
        is presumed when any person acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting
        securities of an insurance company. To obtain the approval of any change in control, the
        proposed acquirer must file an application with the relevant insurance commissioner
        disclosing, among other things, the background of the acquirer and that of its directors
        and officers, the acquirer’s financial condition and its proposed changes in the
        management and operations of the insurance company. U.S. state regulators also require
        prior notice or regulatory approval of material inter-affiliate transactions within the
        holding company structure.

The
        Insurance Companies Act of Canada requires prior approval by the Minister of Finance of
        anyone acquiring a significant interest in an insurance company authorized to do business
        in Canada. In addition, the Company is subject to regulation by the insurance regulators of
        other states and foreign jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business. Certain of
        these states and foreign jurisdictions impose regulations regulating the ability of any
        person to acquire control of an insurance company authorized to do business in that
        jurisdiction without appropriate regulatory approval similar to those described
        above.


Dividends.

Under Bermuda law, Group is
        prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would reduce the realizable
        value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its
        issued share capital and share premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts. Group’s
        ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends
        from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries is limited under
        Bermuda law as well as the laws of the various U.S. states in which Group’s insurance
        and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled. The limitations are
        generally based upon net income and compliance with applicable policyholders’ surplus
        or minimum solvency and liquidity requirements as determined in accordance with the
        relevant statutory accounting practices. As Holdings has outstanding debt obligations, it
        is dependent upon dividends and other permissible payments from its operating subsidiaries
        to enable it to meet its debt and operating expense obligations and to pay dividends to
        Group.

Under
        Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is unable to declare or make payment of a dividend if it fails to
        meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a long-term insurer,
        Bermuda Re is also unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder
        unless, after payment of the dividend, the value of the assets in its long term business
        fund, as certified by its approved actuary, exceeds its liabilities for long term business
        by at least the $250,000 minimum solvency margin. Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary
        Authority is required if Bermuda Re’s dividend payments would reduce its prior year
        end total statutory capital by 15.0% or more. At December 31, 2007, Bermuda Re and Everest
        International exceeded their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant
        margin.

The
        payment of dividends to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to limitations imposed by
        Delaware law. Generally, Everest Re may only pay dividends out of its statutory earned
        surplus, which was $2,886.6 million at December 31, 2007, and only after it has given 10
        days prior notice to the Delaware Insurance Commissioner. During this 10-day period, the
        Commissioner may, by order, limit or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the
        Commissioner finds the insurer to be presently or potentially in financial distress.
        Further, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid without the prior approval of the
        Delaware Insurance Commissioner in any twelve month period is the greater of (1) 10% of the
        insurer’s statutory surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year or (2) the
        insurer’s statutory net income, not including realized capital gains, for the prior
        calendar year. Accordingly, the maximum amount that will be available for the payment of
        dividends by Everest Re in 2008 without triggering the requirement for prior approval of
        regulatory authorities in connection with a dividend is $309.6 million.

Insurance Regulation.

NeitherBermuda Re nor
        Everest International is admitted to do business in any jurisdiction in the U.S. Both
        conduct their insurance business from their offices in Bermuda, and in the case of Bermuda
        Re, its branch in the UK. In Bermuda, Bermuda Re and Everest International are regulated by
        the Insurance Act 1978 (as amended) and related regulations (the “Act”). The
        Act establishes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements
        and subjects Bermuda Re and Everest International to the supervision, investigation and
        intervention powers of the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Under the Act, Bermuda Re and
        Everest International, as Class 4 insurers, are each required to maintain a principal
        office in Bermuda, to maintain a minimum of $100 million in statutory capital and surplus,
        to have an independent auditor approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority conduct an annual
        audit and report on their respective statutory financial statements and filings and to have
        an appointed loss reserve specialist (also approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority)
        review and report on their respective loss reserves annually.

Bermuda
        Re is also registered under the Act as a long-term insurer and is thereby authorized to
        write life and annuity business. As a long term insurer, Bermuda Re is required to maintain
        $250,000 in statutory capital separate from its Class 4 minimum statutory capital and
        surplus, to maintain a long term business fund, to separately account for this business and
        to have an approved actuary prepare a certificate concerning its long term business assets
        and liabilities to be filed annually. Bermuda Re’s operations in the United Kingdom
        and worldwide are subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority (the
        “FSA”). The FSA imposes


solvency, capital adequacy, audit, financial reporting and other regulatory
        requirements on insurers transacting business in the United Kingdom. Bermuda Re presently
        meets or exceeds all of the FSA’s solvency and capital requirements.

U.S.
        domestic property and casualty insurers, including reinsurers, are subject to regulation by
        their state of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed. The regulation of
        reinsurers is typically focused on financial condition, investments, management and
        operation. The rates and policy terms of reinsurance agreements are generally not subject
        to direct regulation by any governmental authority.

The
        operations of Everest Re’s foreign branch offices in Canada and Singapore are subject
        to regulation by the insurance regulatory officials of those jurisdictions. Management
        believes that the Company is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations pertaining
        to its business and operations.

Everest
        Indemnity, Everest National, Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to regulations
        similar to the U.S. regulations applicable to Everest Re. In addition, Everest National and
        Everest Security must comply with substantial regulatory requirements in each state where
        they conduct business. These additional requirements include, but are not limited to, rate
        and policy form requirements, requirements with regard to licensing, agent appointments,
        participation in residual markets and claim handling procedures. These regulations are
        primarily designed for the protection of policyholders.

Licenses.

Everest Re is a licensed property and
        casualty insurer and/or reinsurer in all states (except Nevada and Wyoming), the District
        of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In New Hampshire and Puerto Rico, Everest Re is licensed for
        reinsurance only. Such licensing enables U.S. domestic ceding company clients to take
        credit for uncollateralized reinsurance receivables from Everest Re in their statutory
        financial statements.

Everest
        Re is licensed as a property and casualty reinsurer in Canada. It is also authorized to
        conduct reinsurance business in Singapore. Everest Re can also write reinsurance in other
        foreign countries. Because some jurisdictions require a reinsurer to register in order to
        be an acceptable market for local insurers, Everest Re is registered as a foreign insurer
        and/or reinsurer in the following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,
        El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and the Philippines. Everest
        National is licensed in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Everest Indemnity is
        licensed in Delaware and is eligible to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in 49
        states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Everest Security is licensed in Georgia
        and Alabama. Mt. McKinley is licensed in Delaware and California. Bermuda Re and Everest
        International are registered as Class 4 insurers in Bermuda. Bermuda Re is also registered
        as a long term insurer in Bermuda and an authorized reinsurer in the U.K.

Periodic Examinations.

Everest Re, Everest
        National, Everest Indemnity, Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to periodic
        financial examination (usually every three years) of their affairs by the insurance
        departments of the states in which they are licensed, authorized or accredited. Everest
        Re’s, Everest Security’s, Everest Indemnity’s and Mt. McKinley’s
        last examination reports were as of December 31, 2003, while Everest National’s last
        examination was as of December 31, 2001. None of these reports contained any material
        findings or recommendations. Currently, all five companies are under state financial
        examination for the period ending December 31, 2006. In addition, U.S. insurance companies
        are subject to examinations by the various state insurance departments where they are
        licensed concerning compliance with applicable conduct of business regulations.

NAIC
        Risk-Based Capital Requirements.

The U.S. National Association of
        Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has developed a formula to measure the amount
        of capital appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall
        business operations in light of its size and risk profile. The major categories of a
        company’s risk profile are its asset risk, credit risk, and underwriting risk. The
        standards are an


effort
        by the NAIC to prevent insolvencies, to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance
        companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance
        departments.

Under
        the approved formula, a company’s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based
        capital (“RBC”). If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no action is
        necessary. Below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurer’s
        domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an
        insurer as the ratio of surplus to RBC decreases. The mildest intervention requires an
        insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions. The most severe action requires
        an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated.

Based on
        their financial positions at December 31, 2007, Everest Re, Everest National, Everest
        Indemnity and Everest Security significantly exceed the minimum thresholds. Since Mt.
        McKinley ceased writing new and renewal insurance in 1985, its domiciliary regulator, the
        Delaware Insurance Commissioner, has exempted Mt. McKinley from complying with RBC
        requirements.

Various
        proposals to change the RBC formula arise from time to time. The Company is unable to
        predict whether any such proposal will be adopted, the form in which any such proposals
        would be adopted or the effect, if any, the adoption of any such proposal or change in the
        RBC calculations would have on the Company.

Tax
        Matters.

The
        following summary of the taxation of the Company is based on current law. There can be no
        assurance that legislative, judicial, or administrative changes will not be enacted that
        materially affect this summary.

Bermuda.

Under Bermuda law, no income,
        withholding or capital gains taxes are imposed upon Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries.
        Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries have received an undertaking from the Minister of
        Finance in Bermuda that, in the event of any taxes being imposed, Group and its Bermuda
        subsidiaries will be exempt from taxation in Bermuda until March 2016. Non-Bermuda branches
        of Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the jurisdictions in which they
        operate.

United States.

Group’s U.S. subsidiaries
        conduct business in and are subject to taxation in the U.S. Non-U.S. branches of U.S.
        subsidiaries are subject to local taxation in the jurisdictions in which they operate.
        Should the U.S. subsidiaries distribute current or accumulated earnings and profits in the
        form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to withholding taxes. Group
        and its Bermuda subsidiaries believe that they have operated and will continue to operate
        their businesses in a manner that will not cause them to generate income treated as
        effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. On this
        basis, Group does not expect that it and its Bermuda subsidiaries will be required to pay
        U.S. corporate income taxes other than withholding taxes on certain investment income and
        premium excise taxes. If Group or its Bermuda subsidiaries were to become subject to U.S.
        income tax, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
        condition, results of operations and cash flows.

United Kingdom.

Bermuda Re’s UK branch
        conducts business in the UK and is subject to taxation in the UK. Bermuda Re believes that
        it has operated and will continue to operate its Bermuda operation in a manner which will
        not cause them to be subject to UK taxation. If Bermuda Re’s Bermuda operations were
        to become subject to UK income tax there could be a material adverse impact on the
        Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

ITEM
        1A. RISK FACTORS

In
        addition to the other information provided in this report, the following risk factors
        should be considered when evaluating an investment in our securities. If the circumstances
        contemplated by the individual risk factors materialize, our business, financial condition
        and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price
        of our common shares could decline significantly.

RISKS
        RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS

Our
        results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events.

We are
        exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events, including weather-related and other natural
        catastrophes, as well as acts of terrorism. Any material reduction in our operating results
        caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay
        dividends or to meet our interest and principal payment obligations. We define a
        catastrophe as an event that causes a pre-tax loss on property exposures before reinsurance
        of at least $5.0 million, before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. By way of
        illustration, during the past five calendar years, pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of
        contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs,
        were as follows:

Our
        losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections.

We use
        projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and
        magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool. We use these loss projections to estimate our
        potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the purchase of
        retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given
        geographic area. These loss projections are approximations, reliant on a mix of
        quantitative and qualitative processes, and actual losses may exceed the projections by a
        material amount, resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
        results of operations.


If
        our loss reserves are inadequate to meet our actual losses, net income would be reduced or
        we could incur a loss.

We are
        required to maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability of losses and LAE
        for both reported and unreported claims incurred. These reserves are only estimates of what
        we believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and
        circumstances known to us. In setting reserves for our reinsurance liabilities, we rely on
        claim data supplied by our ceding companies and brokers and we employ actuarial and
        statistical projections. The information received from our ceding companies is not always
        timely or accurate, which can contribute to inaccuracies in our loss projections. Because
        of the uncertainties that surround our estimates of loss and LAE reserves, we cannot be
        certain that ultimate loss and LAE payments will not exceed our estimates. If our reserves
        are deficient, we would be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which such
        deficiencies are identified which would cause a charge to our earnings and a reduction of
        capital. By way of illustration, during the past five calendar years, the reserve
        re-estimation process resulted in a decrease to our pre-tax net income in four of the
        years:

See ITEM
        1, “Business - Changes in Historical Reserves,” which provides a more detailed
        chart showing the effect of reserve re-estimates on calendar year operating results for the
        past ten years.

The
        difficulty in estimating our reserves is significantly more challenging as it relates to
        reserving for potential A&E liabilities. At year-end 2007, roughly 10.2% of our gross
        reserves were comprised of A&E reserves. A&E liabilities are especially hard to
        estimate for many reasons, including the long delays between exposure and manifestation of
        any bodily injury or property damage, difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos
        or environmental contamination, long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating
        liability for the asbestos or environmental damage. Legal tactics and judicial and
        legislative developments affecting the scope of insurers’ liability, which can be
        difficult to predict, also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for A&E
        liabilities.

The
        failure to accurately assess underwriting risk and establish adequate premium rates could
        reduce our net income or result in a net loss.

Our
        success depends on our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the
        businesses on which the risk is retained. If we fail to accurately assess the risks we
        retain, we may fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover our losses and LAE. This
        could reduce our net income and even result in a net loss.

In
        addition, losses may arise from events or exposures that are not anticipated when the
        coverage is priced. An example of an unanticipated event is the terrorist attacks on
        September 11, 2001. Neither the magnitude of loss on a single line of business nor the
        combined impact on several lines of business from an act of terrorism on such a large scale
        was contemplated when we priced our coverages. In addition to unanticipated events, we
        also

face the unanticipated expansion of our exposures, particularly
        in long-tail liability lines. An example of this is the expansion over time of the scope of
        insurers’ legal liability within the mass tort arena, particularly for A&E
        exposures discussed above.


Decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance
        could reduce our net income.

The
        worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical
        by product and market. These cycles, as well as other factors that influence aggregate
        supply and demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products, are outside
        of our control. The supply of (re)insurance is driven by prevailing prices and levels of
        capacity that may fluctuate in response to a number of factors including large catastrophic
        losses and investment returns being realized in the insurance industry. Demand for
        (re)insurance is influenced by underwriting results of insurers and insureds, including
        catastrophe losses, and prevailing general economic conditions. If any of these factors
        were to result in a decline in the demand for (re)insurance or an overall increase in
        (re)insurance capacity, our net income could decrease.

If
        rating agencies downgrade the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, future prospects for
        growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected.

Our
        active insurance company subsidiaries currently hold financial strength ratings assigned by
        third-party rating agencies which assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial
        strength of insurers and reinsurers. Our active subsidiaries carry an “A+”
        (“Superior”) rating from A.M. Best. Everest Re, Bermuda Re and Everest National
        hold an “AA–” (“Very Strong”) rating from Standard &
        Poor’s. Everest Re and Bermuda Re hold an “Aa3” (“Excellent”)
        rating from Moody’s. Financial strength ratings are used by client companies and
        agents and brokers that place the business as an important means of assessing the financial
        strength and quality of reinsurers. A downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might
        adversely affect our ability to market our insurance products and could have a material and
        adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability.

During
        the last five years, no active subsidiary of ours has experienced a financial strength
        rating downgrade. However, we cannot assure that a downgrade will not occur in the future
        if we do not continue to meet the evolving criteria expected of our current rating. In that
        regard, several of the rating agencies are in the process of modifying their approaches to
        evaluating catastrophic risk relative to their capital and risk management requirements.
        Therefore, we cannot predict the outcome of this reassessment or its potential impact upon
        our ratings.

Consistent with market practice, much of our treaty reinsurance business
        allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of our
        obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold. The termination
        provision would generally be triggered if a rating fell below A.M. Best’s A- rating
        level, which is three levels below Everest Re’s current rating of A+. To a lesser
        extent, Everest Re also has modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain
        provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating
        agency downgrade. That provision would also generally be triggered if Everest Re’s
        rating fell below A.M. Best’s A- rating level.

The
        failure of our insureds, intermediaries and reinsurers to satisfy their obligations to us
        could reduce our net income.

In
        accordance with industry practice, we have uncollateralized receivables from insureds,
        agents and brokers and/or rely on agents and brokers to process our payments. We may not be
        able to collect amounts due from insureds, agents and brokers, resulting in a reduction to
        net income.

We are
        also subject to the credit risk of reinsurers in connection with retrocessional
        arrangements because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our
        liability to the insured. In addition, reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though
        they are able to do so. The failure of one or more of our reinsurers to honor their
        obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income
        and could cause us to incur a significant loss.


If we
        are unable or choose not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers, our net
        income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss
        experience.

We are
        generally less reliant on the purchase of reinsurance than many of our competitors, in part
        because of our strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles
        inherent in our business. We try to separate our risk taking process from our risk
        mitigation process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance.
        Because we generally purchase reinsurance only when we expect a net benefit, the percentage
        of business that we reinsure, as indicated below, varies from year to year, depending on
        our view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract
        period.

Changes
        in the availability and cost of reinsurance, which are subject to market conditions that
        are outside of our control, have thus reduced to some extent our ability to use reinsurance
        to tailor the risks we assume on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance
        exposures across our reinsurance operations. Because we have reduced our level of
        reinsurance purchases in recent years, our net income could be reduced following a large
        unreinsured event or adverse overall claims experience.

Our
        industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully in the
        future.

Our
        industry is highly competitive and subject to pricing cycles that can be pronounced. We
        compete globally in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets
        with numerous competitors. Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance
        companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies,
        reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international
        underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s.

According to Standard & Poor’s, we rank among the top ten global
        reinsurance groups, in which 60% of the market share is concentrated. The worldwide premium
        available to the reinsurance market, for both life and non-life business, was estimated to
        be $170 billion in 2006 according to data compiled by the International Association of
        Insurance Supervisors. The top twenty groups in our industry represent approximately 70% of
        these revenues. The leaders in this market are Munich Re, Swiss Re, Berkshire Hathaway,
        Hannover Re and syndicates at Lloyd’s. Some of these competitors have greater
        financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business
        relationships throughout the industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In
        addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the
        potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets
        provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition.
        We may not be able to compete successfully in the future should there be a significant
        change to the competitive landscape of our market.

We
        are dependent on our key personnel.

Our
        success has been, and will continue to be, dependent on the ability to retain the services
        of existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel
        in the future. The loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to
        hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our
        ability to conduct business. Generally, we consider key executive officers to be those
        individuals who have the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling
        operations: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph V. Taranto (age 58), President and
        Chief Operating Officer, Thomas J. Gallagher (age 59), and Executive Vice President and
        Chief Financial Officer, Craig Eisenacher (age 60). Of those three officers, we have
        employment contracts with Mr. Taranto and Mr. Eisenacher. Mr. Taranto’s contract had
        been previously filed with the SEC and was most recently amended on April 5, 2005 to extend
        Mr. Taranto’s term of employment from March 31, 2008 until December 31, 2009. Mr.
        Eisenacher’s contract had


been
        previously filed with the SEC on December 5, 2006 for a term of employment from December
        18, 2006 until December 19, 2008. We are not aware that any of the above three officers are
        planning to leave Group or retire in the near future. We do not maintain any key employee
        insurance on any of our employees.

Special
        considerations apply to our Bermuda operations. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians, other
        than spouses of Bermudians and individuals holding permanent resident certificates, are not
        permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without a work permit issued by
        the Bermuda government. A work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show
        that, after a proper public advertisement, no Bermudian, spouse of a Bermudian or
        individual holding a permanent resident certificate is available who meets the minimum
        standards for the position. The Bermuda government places a six-year term limit on
        individuals with work permits, subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key
        employees of businesses with a significant physical presence in Bermuda. Currently, all six
        of our Bermuda-based professional employees who require work permits have been granted
        permits by the Bermuda government that expire at various times between September 2008 and
        December 2011. This includes Mark de Saram, the chief executive officer of our Bermuda
        reinsurance operation. In the event his work permit were not renewed, we could lose his
        services, thereby adversely affecting our ability to conduct our business in Bermuda until
        we were able to replace him with an individual in Bermuda who did not require a work permit
        or who was granted the permit. The Company has an employment contract with Mr. de Saram,
        which was previously filed with the SEC and was most recently amended on October 31, 2006
        to extend Mr. de Saram’s term of employment from November 1, 2006 until November 1,
        2008.

Our
        investment values and investment income could decline because they are exposed to interest
        rate, credit, and market risks.

A
        significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and
        smaller portions consist of equity securities and other investments. Both the fair market
        value of our invested assets and associated investment income fluctuate depending on
        general economic and market conditions. For example, the fair market value of our
        predominant fixed income portfolio generally increases or decreases inversely to
        fluctuations in interest rates. The market value of our fixed income securities could also
        decrease as a result of a downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of
        such securities to deteriorate. The net investment income that we realize from future
        investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest
        rates.

Interest
        rate fluctuations also can cause net investment income from fixed income investments that
        carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, to differ
        from the income anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase. In addition, if
        issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations, investment income
        will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise.

Because
        all of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale, temporary changes
        in the market value of these investments are reflected as changes to our
        shareholders’ equity. Our actively managed equity security portfolio is fair valued
        and any changes in fair value are reflected as net realized capital gains or losses. As a
        result, a decline in the value of the securities in our portfolio reduces our capital or
        could cause us to incur a loss.

We have
        invested a growing portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities. The value of
        these assets fluctuate with changes in the markets. In times of economic weakness, the fair
        value of these assets may decline, and may negatively impact net income. We also invest in
        non-traditional investments which have different risk characteristics than traditional
        fixed income and equity securities. These alternative investments are comprised primarily
        of private equity limited partnerships. The changes in value and investment income/(loss)
        for these partnerships are more volatile than over-the-counter securities.


The
        following table quantifies the portion of our investment portfolio that consists of fixed
        income securities, equity securities and investments that carry prepayment risk.

We
        may experience foreign currency exchange losses that reduce our net income and capital
        levels.

Through
        our Bermuda and international operations, we conduct business in a variety of foreign
        (non-U.S.) currencies, principally the Euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, and
        the Singapore dollar. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in foreign
        currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates. Our functional currency is
        the U.S. dollar, and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar may materially
        impact our results and financial position. In 2007, we wrote approximately 30.1% of our
        reinsurance coverages in non-U.S. currencies; as of December 31, 2007, we maintained
        approximately 29.1% of our investment portfolio in investments denominated in non-U.S.
        currencies. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the impact on our quarterly pre-tax net income from
        exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of $6.5 million to a gain of $13.0
        million.

RISKS
        RELATING TO REGULATION

Insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to operate and any
        failure to comply with those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on
        our business.

We are
        subject to extensive and increasing regulation under U.S., state and foreign insurance
        laws. These laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our operating
        subsidiaries, impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that we can hold,
        prescribe solvency, accounting and internal control standards that must be met and
        maintained and require us to maintain reserves. These laws also require disclosure of
        material inter-affiliate transactions and require prior approval of
        “extraordinary” transactions. Such “extraordinary” transactions
        include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds.
        These laws also generally require approval of changes of control of insurance companies.
        The application of these laws could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends,
        interest and other payments on securities, as applicable, and could restrict our ability to
        expand business operations through acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries. We may not
        have or maintain all required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety
        of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the
        laws and regulations. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not
        comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could
        preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or
        monetarily penalize us. These types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our
        business. To date, no material fine, penalty or restriction has been imposed on us for
        failure to comply with any insurance law or regulation.


Current
        legal and regulatory activities related to the insurance industry, including investigations
        into contingent commission arrangements and certain finite risk or non-traditional products
        could adversely affect our business and the industry.

The
        insurance industry has experienced uncertainty and negative publicity as a result of
        current litigation, investigations, and regulatory activity by various insurance,
        governmental, and enforcement authorities, including the SEC, with regard to certain
        practices within the insurance industry. These practices include the payment of contingent
        commissions by insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents, the solicitation and
        provision of fictitious or inflated quotes, and the accounting treatment for finite
        reinsurance or other non-traditional, loss mitigation insurance and reinsurance products.
        At this time, it appears the effects of these investigations will have more of an impact on
        specific companies being investigated rather than the industry as a whole, with greater
        transparency and financial reporting disclosures being required for the entire industry in
        these areas; however, the future impact, if any, on our operation, net income or financial
        condition can not be determined at this time.

RISKS
        RELATING TO GROUP'S SECURITIES

Because of our holding company structure, our ability to pay dividends,
        interest and principal is dependent on our receipt of dividends, loan payments and other
        funds from our subsidiaries.

Group
        and Holdings are holding companies, each of whose most significant assets consists of the
        stock of their operating subsidiaries. As a result, each of Group’s and
        Holdings’ ability to pay dividends, interest or other payments on its securities in
        the future will depend on the earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the
        ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it. This
        ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other
        factors beyond our control. Payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of
        the operating subsidiaries are regulated by U.S., state and foreign insurance laws and
        regulatory restrictions, including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. Accordingly,
        the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to us
        and Holdings in the future, which could prevent us from paying dividends, interest or other
        payments on our securities.

Provisions in Group’s bye-laws could have an anti-takeover effect,
        which could diminish the value of its common shares.

Group’s bye-laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and
        make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders
        consider it beneficial to do so. In addition, these provisions could delay or prevent a
        change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. The effect of these
        provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium
        over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover.
        Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt,
        these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if
        they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.

For
        example, Group’s bye-laws contain the following provisions that could have an
        anti-takeover effect:

•

election of directors is staggered, meaning that the members
                        of only one of three classes of directors are selected each
                        year;

•

shareholders have limited ability to remove
                        directors;


•

the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than
                        9.9% of the common shares will be reduced to 9.9% of the total voting power
                        of the common shares;

•

the board of directors may decline to register any transfer
                        of common shares if it has reason to believe that the transfer would result
                        in:

i) any person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more
        than 5.0% of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of Group,

ii) any person holding controlled shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of
        the issued and outstanding share capital of Group, or

iii) any adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to Group, any of its
        subsidiaries or any of its shareholders;

•

Group also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part
                        of a shareholder’s common shares to the extent the board of directors
                        determines it is necessary or advisable to avoid or cure any adverse or
                        potential adverse consequences if:

i) any person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than
        5.0% of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of Group,

ii) any person holds controlled shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the
        issued and outstanding share capital of Group, or

iii) share ownership by any person may result in adverse tax, regulatory or
        legal consequences to Group, any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder.

The
        Board of Directors has indicated that it will apply these bye-law provisions in such manner
        that “passive institutional investors” will be treated similarly to investment
        companies. For this purpose, “passive institutional investors” include all
        persons who are eligible, pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b)(1) under the U.S. Securities Exchange
        Act of 1934, to file a short-form statement on Schedule 13G, other than an insurance
        company or any parent holding company or control person of an insurance company.

Applicable insurance laws may also have an anti-takeover
        effect.

Before a
        person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be
        obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where that insurance company is
        domiciled. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic
        insurance company, a state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the
        financial strength of the applicant, the integrity and competence of the applicant’s
        board of directors and executive officers, the acquiror’s plans for changes to the
        insurance company’s board of directors and executive officers, the acquiror’s
        plans for the future operations of the insurance company and any anti-competitive results
        that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Because any person who
        acquired control of Group would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company
        subsidiaries in the U.S., the insurance change of control laws of Delaware, California and
        Georgia would apply to such a transaction. This could have the effect of delaying or even
        preventing such a change of control.


Investors in Group may have more difficulty in protecting their interests
        than investors in a U.S. corporation.

The
        Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the “Companies Act”), differs in material
        respects from the laws applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. The
        following is a summary of material differences between the Companies Act, as modified in
        some instances by provisions of Group’s bye-laws, and Delaware corporate law that
        could make it more difficult for investors in Group to protect their interests than
        investors in a U.S. corporation. Because the following statements are summaries, they do
        not address all aspects of Bermuda law that may be relevant to Group and its
        shareholders.

Alternate Directors.

Group’s bye-laws
        provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that each director may appoint an alternate director,
        who shall have the power to attend and vote at any meeting of the board of directors or
        committee at which that director is not personally present and to sign written consents in
        place of that director. Delaware law does not provide for alternate directors.

Committees of the Board of Directors.

Group’s bye-laws provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that the board
        of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board appoints, and
        those committees may consist partly or entirely of non-directors. Delaware law allows the
        board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to committees, but those
        committees may consist only of directors.

Interested Directors.

Bermuda law and
        Group’s bye-laws provide that if a director has a personal interest in a transaction
        to which the company is also a party and if the director discloses the nature of this
        personal interest at the first opportunity, either at a meeting of directors or in writing
        to the directors, then the company will not be able to declare the transaction void solely
        due to the existence of that personal interest and the director will not be liable to the
        company for any profit realized from the transaction. In addition, after a director has
        made the declaration of interest referred to above, he or she is allowed to be counted for
        purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which
        he or she has an interest, unless disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the
        relevant board meeting. Under Delaware law, an interested director could be held liable for
        a transaction in which that director derived an improper personal benefit. Additionally,
        under Delaware law, a corporation may be able to declare a transaction with an interested
        director to be void unless one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

•

the material facts as to the interested director’s
                        relationship or interests are disclosed or are known to the board of
                        directors and the board in good faith authorizes the transaction by the
                        affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors,

•

the material facts are disclosed or are known to the
                        shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction and the transaction is
                        specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a majority of the
                        voting shares; or

•

the transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it
                        is authorized, approved or ratified.

Transactions with Significant Shareholders.

As
        a Bermuda company, Group may enter into business transactions with its significant
        shareholders, including asset sales, in which a significant shareholder receives, or could
        receive, a financial benefit that is greater than that received, or to be received, by
        other shareholders with prior approval from Group’s board of directors but
        without obtaining prior approval from the shareholders. In the case of an amalgamation, in
        which two or more companies join together and continue as a single company, a resolution of
        shareholders approved by a majority of at least 75% of the votes cast is required in
        addition to the approval of the board of directors, except in the case of an amalgamation
        with and between wholly-owned subsidiaries. If Group was a Delaware corporation, any
        business combination with an interested shareholder (which, for this purpose, would include
        mergers and asset sales of greater than 10% of Group’s assets that would otherwise be
        considered transactions in the ordinary course of business) within a period of three years
        from the time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval
        from


shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of Group’s outstanding common
        shares not owned by the interested shareholder, unless the transaction qualified for one of
        the exemptions in the relevant Delaware statute or Group opted out of the statute. For
        purposes of the Delaware statute, an “interested shareholder” is generally
        defined as a person who together with that person’s affiliates and associates owns,
        or within the previous three years did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s
        outstanding voting shares.

Takeovers.

Under Bermuda law, if an acquiror
        makes an offer for shares of a company and, within four months of the offer, the holders of
        not less than 90% of the shares that are the subject of the offer tender their shares, the
        acquiror may give the nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their
        shares on the terms of the offer. Within one month of receiving the notice, dissenting
        shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer. The burden is on the
        dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its discretion to enjoin the
        transfer. The court will be unlikely to do this unless there is evidence of fraud or bad
        faith or collusion between the acquiror and the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly
        forcing out minority shareholders. Under another provision of Bermuda law, the holders of
        95% of the shares of a company (the “acquiring shareholders”) may give notice
        to the remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms described in
        the notice. Within one month of receiving the notice, dissenting shareholders may apply to
        the court for an appraisal of their shares. Within one month of the court’s
        appraisal, the acquiring shareholders are entitled either to acquire all shares involved at
        the price fixed by the court or cancel the notice given to the remaining shareholders. If
        shares were acquired under the notice at a price below the court’s appraisal price,
        the acquiring shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and
        return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder, who must then refund the purchase
        price. There are no comparable provisions under Delaware law.

Inspection of Corporate Records.

Members of the
        general public have the right to inspect the public documents of Group available at the
        office of the Registrar of Companies and Group’s registered office, both in Bermuda.
        These documents include the memorandum of association, which describes Group’s
        permitted purposes and powers, any amendments to the memorandum of association and
        documents relating to any increase or reduction in Group’s authorized share capital.
        Shareholders of Group have the additional right to inspect Group’s bye-laws, minutes
        of general meetings of shareholders and audited financial statements that must be presented
        to the annual general meeting of shareholders. The register of shareholders of Group also
        is open to inspection by shareholders without charge, and to members of the public for a
        fee. Group is required to maintain its share register at its registered office in Bermuda.
        Group also maintains a branch register in the offices of its transfer agent in the U.S.,
        which is open for public inspection as required under the Companies Act. Group is required
        to keep at its registered office a register of its directors and officers that is open for
        inspection by members of the public without charge. However, Bermuda law does not provide a
        general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records.
        Under Delaware law, any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporation’s
        shareholder list and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that
        person’s interest as a shareholder.

Shareholder’s Suits.

The rights of
        shareholders under Bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under
        legislation or judicial precedent in many U.S. jurisdictions. Class actions and derivative
        actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of Bermuda. However, the
        Bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow English case law precedent, which
        would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of Group to remedy a wrong done
        to Group where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of Group
        or illegal or would result in the violation of Group’s memorandum of association or
        bye-laws. Furthermore, the court would give consideration to acts that are alleged to
        constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval
        of a greater percentage of Group’s shareholders than actually approved it. The
        winning party in an action of this type generally would be able to recover a portion of
        attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the action. Under Delaware law, class
        actions and derivative actions generally are available to stockholders for breach of
        fiduciary duty, corporate waste and


actions
        not taken in accordance with applicable law. In these types of actions, the court has
        discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys’ fees.

Limitation of Liability of Directors and Officers.

Group’s bye-laws provide that Group and its shareholders waive all
        claims or rights of action that they might have, individually or in the right of the
        Company, against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance
        of that director’s or officer’s duties. However, this waiver does not apply to
        claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud or dishonesty. This waiver may have the
        effect of barring claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws. Under Delaware law, a
        corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation provisions limiting the
        personal liability of its directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary
        damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty. However, these provisions may not limit
        liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or
        that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, the authorization of
        unlawful dividends, stock repurchases or stock redemptions, or any transaction from which a
        director derived an improper personal benefit. Moreover, Delaware provisions would not be
        likely to bar claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

Group’s bye-laws provide that Group shall indemnify its directors or
        officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions, costs, charges,
        liabilities, loss, damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of any act
        done, concurred in or omitted in the conduct of Group’s business or in the discharge
        of their duties. Under Bermuda law, this indemnification may not extend to any matter
        involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to
        the company, as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to appeal. Under
        Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes a party to an
        action, suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer if (1) the
        director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or
        not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and (2) if the action or proceeding
        involves a criminal offense, the director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his
        or her conduct was unlawful.

Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.

Group is
        organized under the laws of Bermuda. Some of our directors and officers may reside outside
        the U.S. A substantial portion of our assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside
        the U.S. A person may not be able to effect service of process within the U.S. on directors
        and officers of Group and those experts who reside outside the U.S. A person also may not
        be able to recover against them or Group on judgments of U.S. courts or to obtain original
        judgments against them or Group in Bermuda courts, including judgments predicated upon
        civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.

Dividends.

Bermuda law does not allow a company
        to declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there
        are reasonable grounds for believing that a company, after the payment is made, would be
        unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or that the realizable value of a
        company’s assets would be less, as a result of the payment, than the aggregate of its
        liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. The share capital
        account represents the aggregate par value of a company’s issued shares, and the
        share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above
        their par value. Under Delaware law, subject to any restrictions contained in a
        company’s certificate of incorporation, a company may pay dividends out of the
        surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the
        dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Surplus is the amount by which the
        net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital. Delaware law also provides that
        dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than
        the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon
        the distribution of assets.


RISKS
        RELATING TO TAXATION

If
        U.S. tax law changes, our net income may be reduced.

In the
        last few years, some members of Congress have expressed concern about U.S. corporations
        that move their place of incorporation to low-tax jurisdictions. Also, some members of
        Congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreign-controlled
        insurers and reinsurers may have over U.S. controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the
        purchase of reinsurance by U.S. insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign
        jurisdictions, including Bermuda. Although the existing legislation that increases the U.S.
        tax burden on so-called “inverting” companies does not apply to us, we do not
        know whether any similar legislation disadvantageous to our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries
        will ever be enacted into law. If it were enacted, the U.S. tax burden on our Bermuda
        operations, or on some business ceded from our licensed U.S. insurance subsidiaries to some
        offshore reinsurers, could be increased. This would reduce our net income.

Group
        and/or Bermuda Re may be subject to U.S. corporate income tax, which would reduce our net
        income.

Bermuda Re.

The income of Bermuda Re is a
        significant portion of our worldwide income from operations. We have established guidelines
        for the conduct of our operations that are designed to ensure that Bermuda Re is not
        engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. Based on its compliance with
        those guidelines, we believe that Bermuda Re should not be required to pay U.S. corporate
        income tax, other than withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income. However, if the
        Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) were to successfully contend that Bermuda Re
        was engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., Bermuda Re would be required to pay U.S.
        corporate income tax on any income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S.,
        and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax. Even if the IRS were to successfully contend that
        Bermuda Re was engaged in a U.S. trade or business, we believe that the U.S.-Bermuda tax
        treaty would preclude the IRS from taxing Bermuda Re’s income except to the extent
        that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that
        subsidiary. We do not believe that Bermuda Re has a permanent establishment in the U.S. If
        the IRS were to successfully contend that Bermuda Re did have income attributable to a
        permanent establishment in the U.S., Bermuda Re would be subject to U.S. tax on that
        income.

Group.

We conduct our operations in a manner
        designed to minimize our U.S. tax exposure.

Based on our compliance
        with guidelines designed to ensure that we generate only immaterial amounts, if any, of
        income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., we believe that we should be
        required to pay only immaterial amounts, if any, of U.S. corporate income tax, other than
        withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income. However, if the IRS successfully contended
        that we had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the
        U.S., we would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on that income, and possibly
        the U.S. branch profits tax and the imposition of such tax would reduce our net
        income.

If
        Bermuda Re became subject to U.S. income tax on its income or if we became subject to U.S.
        income tax, our income could also be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax. In that event,
        Group and Bermuda Re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than
        if they were organized as U.S. corporations. The combined effect of the 35% U.S. corporate
        income tax rate and the 30% branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 54.5%. The
        imposition of these taxes would reduce our net income.

Group
        and/or Bermuda Re may become subject to Bermuda tax, which would reduce our net
        income.

Group
        and Bermuda Re are not subject to income or capital gains taxes in Bermuda. Both companies
        have received an assurance from the Bermuda Minister of Finance under The Exempted
        Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is
        enacted in Bermuda that imposes any tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any
        capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance
        tax, then that tax will not apply to us or to any of our operations or our shares,
        debentures or


other
        obligations until March 28, 2016. This assurance does not prevent the application of any of
        those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda and does not prevent the imposition
        of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land Tax Act 1967 of Bermuda or
        otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to Group or Bermuda Re. There are
        currently no procedures for extending these assurances. As a result, Group and Bermuda Re
        could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which would reduce our net
        income.

Our
        net income will be reduced if U.S. excise and withholding taxes are
        increased.

Bermuda
        Re is subject to an excise tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums it collects with
        respect to risks located in the U.S. In addition, Bermuda Re may be subject to withholding
        tax on dividend income from U.S. sources. These taxes could increase and other taxes could
        be imposed in the future on Bermuda Re’s business, which would reduce our net
        income.

Everest
        Re’s corporate offices are located in approximately 172,500 square feet of leased
        office space in Liberty Corner, New Jersey. Bermuda Re’s corporate offices are
        located in approximately 3,600 total square feet of leased office space in Hamilton,
        Bermuda. The Company’s other fifteen locations occupy a total of approximately 84,200
        square feet, all of which are leased. Management believes that the above-described office
        space is adequate for its current and anticipated needs.

ITEM
        3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the
        ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other
        formal and informal dispute resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the
        Company’s rights and obligations under insurance, reinsurance and other contractual
        agreements. In some disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or
        to collect funds owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others
        to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. These disputes arise from time to time and as
        they arise are addressed, and ultimately resolved, through both informal and formal means,
        including negotiated resolution, arbitration and litigation. In all such matters, the
        Company believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. While the
        final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not
        believe that any of these matters, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse
        effect on the Company’s financial position or liquidity. However, an adverse
        resolution of one or more of these items in any one quarter or fiscal year could have a
        material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in that
        period.

In May
        2005, Holdings received and responded to a subpoena from the SEC seeking information
        regarding certain loss mitigation insurance products. The Company has stated that Holdings
        will fully cooperate with this and any future inquiries and Holdings provided the requested
        information. Holdings does not believe that it has engaged in any improper business
        practices with respect to loss mitigation insurance products.

The
        Company’s insurance subsidiaries have also received and have responded to broadly
        distributed information requests by state regulators including among others, from Delaware
        and Georgia.

        through participants in depositories, such as The Depository Trust Company.

Dividend History and Restrictions.

In 1995,
        the Board of Directors of the Company established a policy of declaring regular quarterly
        cash dividends and has paid a regular quarterly dividend in each quarter since the fourth
        quarter of 1995. The Company declared and paid its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.48
        per share for the four quarters of 2007, $0.12 per share for the first three quarters of
        2006 and $0.24 per share for the fourth quarter of 2006. A committee of the Company’s
        Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.48 per share, payable on or before March 17,
        2008 to shareholders of record on March 3, 2008.


The
        declaration and payment of future dividends, if any, by the Company will be at the
        discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the
        Company’s earnings, financial condition, business needs and growth objectives,
        capital and surplus requirements of its operating subsidiaries, regulatory restrictions,
        rating agency considerations and other factors. As an insurance holding company, the
        Company is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from its
        subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. The payment of dividends to Group
        by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions
        and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance
        regulatory restrictions. See “Regulatory Matters – Dividends” and Note 16

ITEM 6.
        SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The
        following selected consolidated GAAP financial data of the Company as of and for the years
        ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were derived from the consolidated
        financial statements of the Company, which were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The
        following financial data should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
        Statements and accompanying notes.

(1)

Catastrophe losses are presented net of reinsurance and
                        reinstatement premiums. A catastrophe is defined, for purposes of the
                        Selected Consolidated Financial Data, as an event that caused a pre-tax
                        loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least $5.0 million
                        before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. Catastrophe insurance
                        provides coverage for one event.  When limits are exhausted, some
                        contractual arrangements provide for the availability of additional
                        coverage upon the payment of additional premium. This additional premium is
                        referred to as reinstatement premium.

(2)

Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.

(3)

Based on weighted average basic shares outstanding of 63.1
                        million, 64.7 million, 57.6 million, 55.9 million and 54.0 million for
                        2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(4)

Based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 63.6
                        million, 65.3 million, 57.6 million, 56.8 million and 55.0 million for
                        2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(5)

Loss ratio is the GAAP losses and LAE incurred as a
                        percentage of GAAP net premiums earned. Underwriting expense ratio is the
                        GAAP commissions, brokerage, taxes, fees and other underwriting expenses as
                        a percentage of GAAP net premiums earned. Combined ratio is the sum of the
                        loss ratio and underwriting expense ratio.

ITEM
        7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
        OPERATION

The
        following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial
        condition. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
        accompanying notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and
        Supplementary Data”.

Industry Conditions.

The
        worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical
        by product and market. As a result, financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of
        constrained availability, high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant
        capacity, low rates and constrained profitability. Competition in the types of reinsurance
        and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors, including the perceived
        overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer
        by A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor’s, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions
        where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages
        offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance
        business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience
        in lines written. Furthermore, the market impact from these competitive factors related to
        reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business, domestic
        and international geographical areas and distribution channels.

We
        compete in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with
        numerous global competitors. Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance
        companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies,
        reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international
        underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s. Some of these
        competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and
        continuing business relationships, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In
        addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the
        potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets
        provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and
        competition.

In 2007,
        we observed increased competition with generally lower rates, higher commissions and
        demands by cedants for improved terms and conditions. The extent of the increased
        competition and its effect on rates, terms and conditions varied widely by market and
        coverage types. One of the lesser impacted markets was worldwide property catastrophe
        retrocessional coverage. Reinsurance capacity in certain areas including southeastern U.S.
        exposures and energy lines continued to be constrained. In January 2007, the state of
        Florida passed legislation that increased coverage provided by the Florida Hurricane
        Catastrophe Fund, thus potentially reducing the amount of reinsurance that Florida
        companies needed to purchase from the private reinsurance market. In addition, the
        legislature broadened the mandate of the state sponsored homeowners’ insurance
        company to render it a fully competitive market participant. Although we are unable to
        predict the impact on future market conditions from the increased competition and
        legislative developments, we believe that our clients wrote profitable business in Florida
        during 2007 and will continue to purchase both quota share and catastrophe coverage,
        although at likely lower volumes. The balance of the U.S. and international property lines
        experienced mostly modest price declines but we believe they were adequately priced during
        the year.

Our U.S.
        and international casualty lines experienced weaker market conditions, led by medical stop
        loss and D&O reinsurance, as well as the California workers’ compensation
        insurance line. Increased primary price competition and cedants’ increased appetite
        for retaining more profitable business net, following several highly profitable years,
        resulted in modestly softer, but still profitable, reinsurance pricing during the year. Our
        U.S. insurance operation was also affected by these primary casualty insurance market
        conditions; however, given the specialty nature of our business, we believe the impact on
        us to be less severe than on the market generally.


We are
        unable to predict the impact on future market conditions from increased competition and
        legislative initiatives. In addition to these market forces, reinsurers continue to
        reassess their risk appetites and rebalance their property portfolios to obtain a greater
        spread of risk against the backdrop of: (i) recent revisions to the industry’s
        catastrophe loss projection models, which are indicating significantly higher loss
        potentials and consequently higher pricing requirements and (ii) elevated rating agency
        scrutiny and capital requirements for many catastrophe exposed companies.

In light
        of our 2005 catastrophe experience, we have re-examined our risk management practices and
        concluded that our control framework operated generally as intended. We rebalanced our
        property portfolio, particularly within peak catastrophe zones, including the Southeast
        U.S., Mexico and Gulf of Mexico. This effort has enabled us to benefit from market
        dislocations by carefully shifting the mix of our writings toward the most profitable
        classes, lines, customers and territories and by enhancing our portfolio balance and
        diversification.

Overall,
        we believe that current marketplace conditions offer solid opportunities for us given our
        strong ratings, distribution system, reputation and expertise. We continue to employ our
        strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential, while maintaining
        balance and diversification in our overall portfolio.


Financial Summary.

We
        monitor and evaluate our overall performance based upon financial results. The following
        table displays a summary of the consolidated net income (loss), ratios and
        shareholders’ equity for the periods indicated:


Revenues.

Premiums.

Gross written premiums increased by
        $76.7 million, or 1.9%, in 2007 compared to 2006, reflecting growth of $57.4 million in the
        worldwide reinsurance business and a $19.3 million increase in the U.S. Insurance business.
        The increase in worldwide reinsurance is primarily attributable to the strengthening of
        other currencies against the U.S. dollar. Premiums written in strengthening currencies
        convert to more U.S. dollars resulting in comparatively higher reported premiums. Net
        written premiums increased $43.7 million, or 1.1%, in 2007 compared to 2006, slightly less
        than the growth in gross written premiums due to the change in the mix of our program
        business and the resulting change in reinsurance. Net premiums earned increased $144.3
        million, or 3.7%, in 2007 compared to 2006. The greater percentage increase in net premiums
        earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned
        ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are reflected at the initiation
        of the coverage period.

Gross
        written premiums decreased by $107.7 million, or 2.6% in 2006 compared to 2005, as we
        repositioned our U.S. property reinsurance portfolio resulting in improved pricing, but
        lower premium volume; other factors were the run-off of the insurance credit program
        business and a reduction in treaty casualty writings in response to market softening in
        many U.S. casualty reinsurance classes. Net written premiums also decreased by $96.3
        million, or 2.4% in 2006 compared to 2005, in line with the percentage reduction in gross
        written premiums. Net premiums earned declined by $109.9 million, or 2.8% in 2006 compared
        to 2005.

Net
        Investment Income

. Net investment income increased 8.4% in 2007
        compared to 2006, primarily due to the growth in invested assets. The growth in invested
        assets was principally driven by $854.4 million of operating cash flows and appreciation in
        portfolio assets. The average pre-tax investment portfolio yield for 2007 was 4.9% compared
        to the average investment portfolio yield of 4.8% for 2006.

Net
        investment income increased 20.4% in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting continued
        year-over-year growth in invested assets from the $636.3 million cash flow from operations
        and a $43.2 million increase in income from limited partnership investments. The average
        investment portfolio yield for 2006 was 4.8% compared to 2005 average investment portfolio
        yield of 4.4%.

Net
        Realized Capital Gains.

Net realized capital gains were $86.3
        million, $35.1 million and $90.3 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
        increase in 2007 is primarily attributable to our adoption on January 1, 2007, of FAS No.
        159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - including
        an amendment to FASB statement No. 115” (“FAS 159”) for our actively
        managed equity security investment portfolio. In 2007, we recorded $76.6 million of net
        realized capital gains due to fair value re-measurements.

Net
        Derivative Expense.

We sold seven equity index put options, which
        are outstanding. These contracts meet the definition of a derivative under FAS No. 133,
        “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS
        133”). We recognized net derivative expense of $2.1 million, $0.4 million and $2.6
        million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which represent changes in the fair value of
        these contracts year over year.

Other
        Income (Expense)

. For 2007 and 2006, we recorded other income of
        $18.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively, and for 2005 other expense of $11.1 million.
        The fluctuations in net other income (expense) were primarily due to the fluctuations in
        foreign currency exchange rates.


Claims and Expenses.

Incurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.

The following table presents our incurred losses and loss adjustment
        expenses (“LAE”) for the periods indicated.

Incurred
        losses and LAE increased by $113.7 million, or 4.7% in 2007 compared to the same period in
        2006, principally as a result of the $280.9 million increase in A&E loss reserve
        strengthening, which was partially offset by a $127.9 million decrease in catastrophe
        losses and a $39.3 million decrease in attritional losses. The increase in A&E reserves
        was due to an extensive in-house study by our actuarial and claim units. The decrease in
        catastrophe losses reflects the decrease in prior years development.

Incurred
        losses and LAE decreased by $1,289.9 million, or 34.6% in 2006 compared to 2005, due to
        significantly reduced current year catastrophe losses and a reduction in current and prior
        years attritional losses, partially offset by increased prior years reserve development on
        catastrophe and A&E losses. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were
        $1,485.7 million in 2005, related principally to aggregate estimated losses from Hurricanes
        Katrina, Rita and Wilma.

Our
        current year attritional loss ratios for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 54.8%, 59.3% and 60.2%,
        respectively, reflective of generally favorable market conditions and our business
        production and risk selection practices.

We have
        also recorded favorable development on our attritional loss reserves aggregating $658.3
        million over the past three years. The $272.3 million of adverse development on catastrophe
        loss reserves experienced in 2006 largely emanated from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.
        The unprecedented size and widespread damage from these events, particularly Katrina, made
        projecting ultimate losses extremely difficult.

Commission, Brokerage, Taxes and Fees.

Commission, brokerage, and tax expenses increased by $78.5 million, or 8.9%
        in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in net earned premiums, an increase in ceding
        commissions due to market conditions and higher commissions on new insurance programs were
        the principal drivers of the increase in this directly variable expense.

Commission, brokerage, and tax expenses decreased $31.5 million, or 3.5% in
        2006 compared to 2005, generally in line with the decrease in premiums earned of
        2.8%.

Other
        Underwriting Expenses.

Other underwriting expenses for 2007
        increased by $14.6 million, or 10.6%, compared to 2006, primarily due to higher
        compensation and benefits expense and an increased staff count, primarily in the U.S.
        Insurance segment. Included in other underwriting expenses were corporate underwriting
        expenses, which are expenses that are not allocated to segments, of $13.1 million for 2007
        compared to $26.5


million
        for 2006. The decrease was primarily due to the allocation of share-based compensation
        expense in 2007 to segments.

Other
        underwriting expenses for 2006 increased by $8.2 million, or 6.3%, compared to 2005,
        primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense was $91.6
        million and $69.9 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase was due to the new
        long term notes we issued in April, 2007 and the acceleration of the bond amortization
        costs associated with the November 15, 2007 early retirement of the 7.85% junior
        subordinated debt securities.

Interest
        expense was $69.9 million and $74.4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease
        is primarily due to the retirement on March 15, 2005 of the 8.5% senior notes issued on
        March 14, 2000.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit).

Our income tax
        expense was $188.7 million, which represented an 18.4% effective tax rate for 2007 compared
        to $150.9 million, which represented a 15.2% effective tax rate for 2006. The increase in
        the effective tax rate is principally due to the increase and jurisdictional mix in pre-tax
        income, including a significant increase in net realized gains and the $12.3 million
        provision for potential additional tax related to our tax treatment of foreign exchange.
        Absent this provision, the tax rate would have been 17.2%. The Internal Revenue Service has
        challenged our foreign exchange treatment, and although we believe we have a strong chance
        of prevailing on this issue, we have provided for the potential additional tax for all
        years still open for examination. Aside from such discrete items, our income tax expense is
        primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding pre-tax income in the
        jurisdictions where we operate, coupled with the impact from tax-preferenced investment
        income. Variations in our effective tax rate generally result from changes in the relative
        levels of pre-tax income among jurisdictions with different tax rates.

Our
        income tax expense was $150.9 million, which represented a 15.2% effective tax rate for
        2006 compared to an income tax benefit of $62.3 million, which represented a 22.2%
        effective tax rate for 2005. The fluctuation in the effective tax rate is principally due
        to the impact of the large catastrophe losses in 2005.

Net
        Income (Loss).

Net
        income was slightly lower at $839.3 million for 2007 compared to $840.8 million for 2006,
        as a result of the changes in the various statement lines discussed above.

Net
        income increased significantly to $840.8 million in 2006 compared to a net loss of $218.7
        million for 2005. This earnings improvement reflected the favorable effect of a benign U.S.
        hurricane season relative to unprecedented Company and industry hurricane losses
        experienced in 2005, as well as favorable underlying underwriting fundamentals.

Ratios.

Our
        combined ratio increased by 1.9 points to 91.6% in 2007 compared to 89.7% in 2006,
        principally driven by the 1.2 point increase in the commission and brokerage ratio,
        followed by the 0.5 point increase in the loss ratio and the 0.2 point increase in the
        other underwriting expense ratio.

Our
        combined ratio decreased by 30.6 points to 89.7% in 2006 compared to 120.3% in 2005,
        reflective of the lower catastrophe and attritional losses.

Shareholders’ Equity.

Shareholders’ equity increased by $0.6 billion to $5.7 billion in 2007
        from $5.1 billion in 2006, principally as a result of the $839.3 million of net income
        generated for the period, partially offset by the repurchase of 2.5 million common shares
        at a cost of $241.6 million and the payment of $121.4 million of shareholder
        dividends.


Shareholders’ equity increased by $1.0 billion to $5.1 billion in 2006
        from $4.1 billion in 2005, principally as a result of the $840.8 million of net income
        generated for the period and $88.4 million of after-tax appreciation from our investment
        portfolio, partially offset by the payment of $39.0 million of shareholder
        dividends.

Consolidated Investment Results

Net
        Investment Income.

Net
        investment income increased 8.4% to $682.4 million in 2007 from $629.4 million in 2006,
        principally reflecting a growth in invested assets to $14.9 billion at December 31, 2007
        from $14.0 billion at December 31, 2006. The asset growth emanated largely from continued
        positive cash flow from operations.

Net
        investment income increased 20.4% to $629.4 million in 2006 from $522.8 million in 2005,
        primarily reflecting the growth in invested assets to $14.0 billion at December 31, 2006
        from $13.0 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition, growth in limited partnership income
        of $43.2 million contributed to the increase.

The
        following table shows the components of net investment income for the periods
        indicated:

The
        following table shows a comparison of various investment yields for the periods
        indicated:


Because
        of our historical income orientation, we had generally managed our investments to maximize
        reportable income. Starting in 2004, we began investing a portion of our assets in equity
        securities, principally in response to perceived changes in the relative attractiveness of
        the debt and equity markets. The following table provides a comparison of our total return
        by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for the periods
        indicated.

The
        pre-tax equivalent return for the bond portfolio was approximately 5.7%, 5.3% and 3.7%,
        respectively, for 2007, 2006 and 2005. The pre-tax equivalent return adjusts the yield on
        tax-exempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent.


Net
        Realized Capital Gains.

The
        following table presents the composition of our net realized capital gains for the periods
        indicated:

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted and implemented FAS 159 for our
        actively managed equity securities. As such, we recorded $76.6 million of net realized
        gains from fair value re-measurements in our consolidated statements of operations and
        comprehensive income for 2007.


Segment Results.

Through
        our subsidiaries, we operate in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
        Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property and
        casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers,
        as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance operation
        writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agents and surplus lines
        brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine,
        aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly
        with ceding companies. The International operation writes non-U.S. property and casualty
        reinsurance through Everest Re’s branches in Canada and Singapore and offices in
        Miami and New Jersey. The Bermuda operation provides insurance and reinsurance to worldwide
        property and casualty markets and reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets
        through its UK branch.

These
        segments are managed in a coordinated fashion with respect to pricing, risk management,
        control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations.
        Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating
        segments based upon their underwriting results.

Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred,
        commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses. We measure our
        underwriting results using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other
        underwriting expense ratios, which respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and
        brokerage and other underwriting expenses by earned premium. We utilize inter-affiliate
        reinsurance, although such reinsurance does not materially impact segment results, as
        business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first
        produced.

Our loss
        and LAE reserves are our best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We
        re-evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including all prior period reserves, taking
        into consideration all available information and, in particular, recently reported loss
        claim experience and trends related to prior periods. Such re-evaluations are recorded in
        incurred losses in the period in which re-evaluation is made.


The
        following discusses the underwriting results for each of our segments for the periods
        indicated:

U.S.
        Reinsurance.

The
        following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the U.S. Reinsurance
        segment for the periods indicated.

Premiums.

Gross written premiums decreased by
        10.7% to $1,193.5 million in 2007 from $1,336.7 million in 2006, primarily due to a $202.6
        million (37.9%) decrease in treaty casualty volume and a $70.5 million (32.7%) decrease in
        facultative volume, partially offset by a $126.8 million (21.6%) increase in treaty
        property volume. The increase in treaty property writings emanated principally from new
        quota share treaties. The more competitive environment for the U.S. casualty business
        resulted in reduced opportunities to write this business profitably. Net written premiums
        decreased 11.2% to $1,183.1 million in 2007 compared to $1,331.7 million in 2006, primarily
        due to the decrease in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased slightly to
        $1,282.9 million for 2007 compared to $1,281.1 million for 2006. The change in net premiums
        earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned
        ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of
        the coverage period.

Gross
        written premiums decreased 3.6% to $1,336.7 million in 2006 from $1,386.2 million in 2005,
        primarily due to a $72.7 million (12.0%) decrease in treaty casualty volume, partially
        offset by a $16.4 million (2.9%) increase in treaty property volume and an $11.6 million
        (5.7%) increase in facultative volume. Net written premiums decreased 3.8% to $1,331.7
        million in 2006 compared to $1,383.7 million in 2005, primarily due to the decrease in
        gross written premiums.Net premiums earned decreased 8.2% to $1,281.1 million for 2006
        compared to $1,396.1 million for 2005. The change in net premiums earned relative to net
        written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage
        period whereas written premiums are recorded at the initiation of the coverage
        period.


Incurred Losses and LAE.

The following table
        presents the incurred losses and LAE for the U.S. Reinsurance segment for the periods
        indicated.

The
        current year’s attritional loss ratio improved by 7.9 points due to results from
        increased property quota share business. We experienced $181.7 million of catastrophe loss
        development in 2006 which did not recur in 2007, which contributed another 14.6 points. In
        addition, we had a greater amount of favorable reserve development related to prior years,
        which provided 7.0 points of improvement. These favorable factors were partially mitigated
        by an 18.6 point increase driven by asbestos reserve strengthening.

Incurred
        losses and LAE decreased 42.5% to $851.2 million for 2006 compared to $1,479.6 million for
        2005, primarily due to significantly reduced catastrophe losses, principally within the
        treaty property unit and decreased earned premiums. The segment loss ratio improved by 39.6
        points for 2006 compared to 2005. The factors driving this change were a favorable 35.8
        point decrease in catastrophe losses and a 5.1 point decrease in the attritional loss
        ratio.

        expenses increased by 9.8% to $327.2 million for 2007 from $298.1 million in 2006,
        principally due to an $18.9 million increase in contingent commissions and somewhat higher
        base ceding commissions, generally. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased
        to $33.3 million from $24.9 million for 2006, principally due to the allocation of certain
        corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate
        expenses.

Commission and brokerage decreased by 16.8% to $298.1 million in 2006 from
        $358.1 million in 2005, principally due to decreased earned premium volume and the mix of
        business. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2006 increased nominally to $24.9 million
        from $24.0 million for 2005.


U.S.
        Insurance.

The
        following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the U.S. Insurance segment
        for the periods indicated.

Premiums.

Gross written premiums increased by
        2.2% to $885.6 million for 2007 from $866.3 million for 2006. The increase is primarily the
        result of a new program we assumed late in 2007 for approximately $76 million of gross
        written premium. Absent this new program, gross written premiums would have decreased due
        to the further decline in our workers’ compensation and contractors liability
        writings in response to increased competition. Net written premiums decreased by 1.2% to
        $744.3 million for 2007 compared to $753.3 million for 2006 as our retention level fell
        slightly. Net premiums earned decreased 3.4% to $735.9 million for 2007 from $761.7 million
        for 2006. The change in net premiums earned relative to net written premiums is the result
        of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums
        are reflected at the initiation of the coverage period.

Gross
        written premiums decreased by 7.1% to $866.3 million for 2006 from $932.5 million for 2005.
        The decrease was primarily the result of declines in our workers’ compensation and
        contractors liability writings in response to increased competition, partially offset by
        some growth from new programs. Net written premiums decreased 7.6% to $753.3 million for
        2006 compared to $815.3 million for 2005, primarily due to the decrease in gross written
        premiums. Net premiums earned decreased 7.5% to $761.7 million for 2006 from $823.0 million
        for 2005, in line with the decrease in net written premiums.


Incurred Losses and LAE.

The following table
        presents the incurred losses and LAE for the U.S. Insurance segment for the periods
        indicated.

Incurred
        losses and LAE increased by 7.0% to $556.4 million for 2007 from $519.9 million for 2006 as
        the segment loss ratio increased by 7.3% to 75.6%. From a ratio perspective, the swing in
        prior years’ development from favorable in 2006 to adverse in 2007 resulted in 14.0
        points of increase.

The
        adverse development in 2007 was the result of $60 million of adverse reserve run-off on a
        canceled auto loan credit insurance program, partially offset by favorable development on
        the remainder of the reserves. The 2007 accident year loss ratio was 70.5% which was 6.7
        points lower than 2006. The 2006 accident year loss ratio was negatively impacted by the
        auto loan credit insurance program referenced above.

Incurred
        losses and LAE decreased 2.0% to $519.9 million for 2006 from $530.8 million for 2005,
        primarily due to lower earned premiums, which related to the reduction in the California
        workers’ compensation business and cancellation of the auto loan credit insurance
        program. The segment loss ratio increased 3.8 points, primarily due to higher losses on the
        auto loan credit insurance program.

Segment Expenses.

Commission and brokerage
        increased by 10.6% to $136.2 million for 2007 from $123.1 million in 2006, principally due
        to an increase in regular commission on new programs and profit commissions. Segment other
        underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to $58.2 million as compared to $48.9 million for
        2006, primarily due to increased compensation costs associated with increased staff and the
        allocation of certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in
        corporate expenses.

Commission and brokerage decreased 7.2% to $123.1 million for 2006 from
        $132.6 million in 2005, principally due to a decrease in written and earned premiums.
        Segment other underwriting expenses for 2006 decreased to $48.9 million as compared to
        $51.9 million for 2005.


Specialty Underwriting.

The
        following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the Specialty Underwriting
        segment for the periods indicated.

Premiums.

Gross written premiums increased by
        7.5% to $270.1 million for 2007 from $251.2 million for 2006. This increase was the result
        of a $36.9 million (58.7%) increase in marine writings and a $12.2 million (14.7%) increase
        in A&H writings, partially offset by a $24.6 million (34.9%) decrease in surety
        writings and a $5.7 million (16.5%) decrease in aviation writings. The increased marine
        premium growth emanated from growth in existing quota share business as well as new quota
        share contracts. We continued to decrease our aviation and surety writings, in response to
        more competitive market conditions. Net written premiums increased 8.2% to $263.8 million
        for 2007 compared to $243.8 million for 2006, as a result of the increase in gross written
        premiums. Net premiums earned increased 7.2% to $262.0 million for 2007 compared to $244.5
        million for 2006, generally in line with the growth in net written premiums. By line of
        business, we experienced a $31.2 million (51.7%) increase in marine premium and a $14.0
        million (18.2%) increase in A&H premium, partially offset by a $21.9 million (30.3%)
        decrease in surety premium and a $5.2 million (14.9%) decrease in aviation premium, which
        is in line with the change in gross and net written premiums. The change in net premiums
        earned relative to net written premiums is the result of timing; premiums are earned
        ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are reflected at the initiation
        of the coverage period.

Gross
        written premiums decreased 20.2% to $251.2 million for 2006 from $314.6 million for 2005.
        This decrease was the result of a $53.2 million (39.0%) decrease in A&H writings, a
        $14.8 million (19.0%) decrease in marine writings and an $8.9 million (20.5%) decrease in
        aviation writings, partially offset by a $13.4 million (23.5%) increase in surety writings.
        Net written premiums decreased 18.5% to $243.8 million for 2006 compared to $299.3 million
        for 2005, due to the decrease in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned decreased
        18.9% to $244.5 million for 2006 compared to $301.5 million for 2005, generally in line
        with the growth in net written premiums. By line of business, we experienced a $51.2
        million (40.1%) decrease in A&H business, a $17.8 million (22.7%) decrease in marine
        business and a $7.4 million (17.7%) decrease in aviation business, partially offset by an
        increase of $19.0 million (35.5%) in surety business.


Incurred Losses and LAE.

The following table
        presents the incurred losses and LAE for the Specialty Underwriting segment for the periods
        indicated.

Incurred
        losses and LAE increased 5.7% to $173.3 million for 2007 compared to $163.9 million for
        2006, generally proportional to the increase in net earned premiums. The loss ratio for the
        current accident year was slightly lower in 2007 compared to 2006. We experienced 10.2
        points of adverse development in 2007 compared to 9.3 points in 2006. Catastrophe loss
        development, principally within the marine business related to Hurricane Katrina, was the
        driver of the overall development in both 2007 and 2006.

Incurred
        losses and LAE decreased 48.4% to $163.9 million for 2006 compared to $317.9 million for
        2005. The segment loss ratio was 38.5 points lower in 2006 than 2005, principally due to
        decreased catastrophe losses in 2006.

Segment Expenses.

Commission and brokerage
        increased 1.0% to $68.5 million in 2007 from $67.8 million in 2006 due primarily to premium
        growth. Segment other underwriting expenses increased 28.8% to $8.5 million for 2007 from
        $6.6 million for 2006, primarily due to the allocation of certain corporate charges to
        segments, which had been previously retained in corporate expenses.

Commission and brokerage decreased 14.9% to $67.8 million in 2006 from $79.7
        million in 2005, primarily due to the decrease in writings. Segment other underwriting
        expenses decreased 2.9% to $6.6 million for 2006 from $6.8 million for 2005.


International.

The
        following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the International segment
        for the periods indicated.

Premiums.

Gross written premiums increased by
        10.1% to $805.9 million for 2007 from $731.7 million for 2006. Approximately half of this
        increase was attributable to the impact of other currencies strengthening against the U.S.
        dollar. We wrote reinsurance contracts in multiple currencies and as these currencies
        strengthened and were converted to U.S. dollars for financial reporting, they converted to
        higher dollar values. Business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices increased
        by $35.0 million (8.0%), business written through the Asian branch increased by $22.3
        million (15.6%) and business written through the Canadian branch increased by $17.9 million
        (11.8%). We have experienced strong fundamental growth in geographic areas where economic
        growth and demand for reinsurance is strong. Net written premiums increased by 10.3% to
        $806.0 million for 2007 compared to $730.7 million for 2006, principally as a result of the
        increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned increased 11.7% to $803.8 million
        for 2007 compared to $719.5 million for 2006, consistent with the increase in net written
        premiums.

Gross
        written premiums increased by 3.6% to $731.7 million for 2006 from $706.6 million for 2005.
        Business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices increased by $47.1 million
        (12.1%) and business written through the Canadian branch increased by $22.8 million
        (17.7%). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $44.1 million (23.5%) in
        premiums written through the Asian branch. Net written premiums increased by 3.7% to $730.7
        million for 2006 compared to $704.9 million for 2005, in line with the increase in gross
        written premiums. Net premiums earned increased by 5.3% to $719.5 million for 2006 compared
        to $683.4 million for 2005, consistent with the increase in net written
        premiums.


Incurred Losses and LAE.

The following table
        presents the incurred losses and LAE for the International segment for the periods
        indicated.

Incurred
        losses and LAE increased by 31.1% to $501.9 million for 2007 compared to $382.8 million for
        2006. The segment loss ratio increased by 9.2 points, principally due to an increase in the
        catastrophe loss ratio by 6.1 points. In 2007, catastrophe losses included Tabasco, Mexico
        floods, $28.5 million; New South Wales storm, $21.1 million; Peruvian earthquake, $10.0
        million; Hurricane Dean, $9.0 million and Jakarta flood, $6.8 million. The 2007 accident
        year attritional loss ratio was 54.2%, about the same as 2006; however, the reduction in
        favorable reserve development, year over year, accounted for 3 points of the increase in
        the segment loss ratio in 2007 compared to 2006.

Incurred
        losses and LAE decreased 33.4% to $382.8 million for 2006 compared to $574.7 million for
        2005. The segment loss ratio decreased by 30.9 points, principally due to reduced current
        year catastrophe losses in Canada, Asia and International. The catastrophe losses for 2005
        included the impact from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.

Segment Expenses.

Commission and brokerage
        increased 10.5% to $199.5 million for 2007 from $180.5 million in 2006, which was in line
        with the increase in premiums. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to
        $18.6 million compared to $13.8 million for 2006, primarily due to the allocation of
        certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate
        expenses.

Commission and brokerage increased 8.1% to $180.5 million for 2006 from
        $167.0 million in 2005. Segment other underwriting expenses increased 9.5% to $13.8 million
        compared to $12.6 million for 2005.


Bermuda.

The
        following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the Bermuda segment for
        the periods indicated.

Premiums.

Gross written premiums increased 13.2%
        to $922.5 million for 2007 compared to $814.9 million for 2006. Premiums written from the
        Bermuda office increased $61.0 million, or 22.9%, and premiums written from the UK office
        increased $47.3 million, or 8.6%. The increase in the Bermuda office premiums was driven by
        growth in worldwide treaty casualty reinsurance business and approximately half of the
        increase from the UK office was driven by the Pound Sterling currency strengthening against
        the U.S. dollar during 2007. Net written premiums increased 13.0% to $922.3 million for
        2007 compared to $816.2 million for 2006, commensurate with the increase in gross written
        premiums. Net premiums earned increased 7.9% to $912.9 million for 2007 compared to $846.4
        million for 2006. The change in net premiums earned relative to the net written premiums is
        the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written
        premiums are reflected at the initiation of the coverage period.

Gross
        written premiums increased 6.0% to $814.9 million for 2006 compared to $768.7 million for
        2005. Premiums written from the UK office increased $72.4 million, or 15.2%, and premiums
        written from the Bermuda office decreased $26.5 million, or 9.0%. Contributing to the
        growth was a slight increase in both the worldwide casualty and property business. Net
        written premiums increased 6.2% to $816.2 million for 2006 compared to $768.8 million for
        2005, as the result of the increase in gross written premiums. Net premiums earned
        increased 11.5% to $846.4 million for 2006 compared to $759.1 million for 2005.


Incurred Losses and LAE.

The following table
        presents the incurred losses and LAE for the Bermuda segment for the periods
        indicated.

Incurred
        losses and LAE increased 18.3% to $611.2 million for 2007 compared to $516.6 million for
        2006. The segment loss ratio for Bermuda increased 6.0 points, reflecting a 5.7 point
        increase in catastrophe losses and a 3.9 point increase for A&E losses, partially
        offset by a 3.8 point decrease for attritional losses. The current year catastrophe losses
        include winter storm Kyrill and the June and July, 2007 London floods. The increase in
        A&E losses was due to the strengthening of asbestos reserves, principally for the
        direct business.

Incurred
        losses and LAE decreased 37.1% to $516.6 million for 2006 compared to $821.4 million for
        2005. The segment loss ratio for Bermuda decreased 47.2 points, reflecting a 45.9 point
        decrease for catastrophe losses and a 1.4 point decrease for attritional losses, partially
        offset by a slight increase for A&E losses. The catastrophe losses for 2005 were
        primarily driven by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma.

Segment Expenses.

Commission and brokerage
        increased 7.8% to $230.4 million for 2007 from $213.7 million for 2006, principally due to
        increases in premiums earned. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2007 increased to
        $20.9 million compared to $17.2 million for 2006, primarily due to the allocation of
        certain corporate charges to segments, which had been previously retained in corporate
        expenses.

Commission and brokerage increased 20.4% to $213.7 million for 2006 from
        $177.5 million in 2005, principally due to increases in premiums earned and changes in the
        mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses for 2006 increased 6.2% to $17.2
        million compared to $16.2 million for 2005, generally in line with the growth in gross
        written premiums.


CRITICAL
        ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The
        following is a summary of the critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates
        that (1) require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2)
        could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different
        assumptions.

Loss
        and LAE Reserves.

Our most critical accounting policy is the
        determination of our loss and LAE reserves. We maintain reserves equal to our estimated
        ultimate liability for losses and LAE for reported and unreported claims for our insurance
        and reinsurance businesses. Because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate losses and
        LAE by underwriting or accident year, we use a variety of statistical and actuarial
        techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time, evaluate new information as it becomes
        known and adjust reserves whenever an adjustment appears warranted. We consider many
        factors when setting reserves including: (1) our exposure base and projected ultimate
        premiums earned; (2) our expected loss ratios by product and class of business, which are
        developed collaboratively by underwriters and actuaries; (3) actuarial methodologies which
        analyze our loss reporting and payment experience, reports from ceding companies and
        historical trends, such as reserving patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current
        legal interpretations of coverage and liability; (5) economic conditions; and (6)
        uncertainties discussed below regarding our liability for A&E claims. Based on these
        considerations, management believes that adequate provisions have been made for our
        insurance and reinsurance loss and LAE reserves. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may
        deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves. Our net income will be impacted in a
        period in which the change in estimated ultimate losses and LAE is recorded. See also Note
        1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We
        believe it is more difficult to accurately estimate loss reserves for reinsurance
        liabilities than for insurance liabilities. At December 31, 2007 we had reinsurance
        reserves of $6,841.5 million and insurance loss reserves of $2,199.1 million, of which
        $585.3 million and $273.6 million, respectively, were loss reserves for A&E
        liabilities. A detailed discussion of additional considerations related to A&E
        exposures follows later in this section.

The
        detailed data required to evaluate ultimate losses for our insurance business is
        accumulated from our underwriting and claim systems. Reserving for reinsurance requires
        evaluation of loss information received from ceding companies. Ceding companies report
        losses to us in many forms dependent on the type of contract and the agreed or contractual
        reporting requirements. Generally, proportional/quota share contracts require the
        submission of a monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss activity for the
        period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company. This information
        is recorded into our records. For certain proportional contracts, we may require a detailed
        loss report for claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular
        type of loss. Excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss
        reporting with precautionary notices provided when a loss reaches a significant percentage
        of the attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury
        occur. Our experienced claims staff handles individual loss reports and supporting claim
        information. Based on our evaluation of a claim, we may establish additional case reserves
        (ACRs) in addition to the case reserves reported by the ceding company. To ensure ceding
        companies are submitting required and accurate data, the Underwriting, Claim, Reinsurance
        Accounting and Internal Audit departments of the Company perform various reviews of our
        ceding companies, particularly larger ceding companies, including on-site
        audits.

We sort
        both our reinsurance and insurance reserves into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis.
        We assign our business to exposure groupings so that the underlying exposures have
        reasonably homogeneous loss development characteristics and are large enough to facilitate
        credible estimation of ultimate losses. We periodically review our exposure groupings and
        we may change our grouping over time as our business changes. We currently use over 200
        exposure groupings to develop our reserve estimates. One of the key selection
        characteristics for the exposure groupings is the historical duration of the claims
        settlement process. Business in which claims are reported and settled relatively quickly
        are commonly referred to as short tail lines, principally


property
        lines. On the other hand, casualty claims tend to take longer to be reported and settled
        and casualty lines are generally referred to as long tail lines. Our estimates of ultimate
        losses for shorter tail lines, with the exception of loss estimates for large catastrophic
        events, generally exhibit less volatility than those for the longer tail lines.

We use
        similar actuarial methodologies, such as expected loss ratio, chain ladder reserving
        methods and Borhuetter Ferguson, supplemented by judgment where appropriate, to estimate
        our ultimate losses and LAE for each exposure group. Although we use similar actuarial
        methodologies for both short tail and long tail lines, the faster reporting of experience
        for the short tail lines allows us to have greater confidence in our estimates of ultimate
        losses for short tail lines at an earlier stage than for long tail lines. As a result, we
        utilize, as well, exposure-based methods to estimate our ultimate losses for longer tail
        lines, especially for immature accident years. For both short and long tail lines, we
        supplement these general approaches with analytically based judgments. We cannot estimate
        losses from widespread catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, using traditional actuarial
        methods. We estimate losses for these types of events based on information derived from
        catastrophe models, quantitative and qualitative exposure analyses, reports and
        communications from ceding companies and development patterns for historically similar
        events. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses, these estimates are
        subject to variability, which increases with the severity and complexity of the underlying
        event.

Our key
        actuarial assumptions contain no explicit provisions for reserve uncertainty nor do we
        supplement the actuarially determined reserves for uncertainty.

Our
        carried reserves at each reporting date are our best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and
        LAE at that date. We complete detailed reserve studies for each exposure group annually for
        our reinsurance operations and quarterly for our insurance operations. The completed annual
        reinsurance reserve studies are “rolled forward” for each accounting period
        until the subsequent reserve study is completed. The roll-forward process involves
        comparing actual reported losses to expected losses based on the most recent reserve study.
        We analyze significant variances between actual and expected losses and post adjustments to
        our reserves as warranted recorded.

Given
        the inherent variability in our loss reserves, we have developed an estimated range of
        possible gross reserve levels. A table of ranges by segment, accompanied by commentary on
        potential and historical variability, is included in “Financial Condition - Loss and
        LAE Reserves”. The ranges are statistically developed using the exposure groups used
        in the reserve estimation process and aggregated to the segment level. For each exposure
        group, our actuaries calculate a range for each accident year based principally on two
        variables. The first is the historical changes in losses and LAE incurred but not reported
        (“IBNR”) for each accident year over time; the second is volatility of each
        accident year’s held reserves related to estimated ultimate losses, also over time.
        Both are measured at various ages from the end of the accident year through the final
        payout of the year’s losses. Ranges are developed for the exposure groups using
        statistical methods to adjust for diversification; the ranges for the exposure groups are
        aggregated to the segment level, likewise, with an adjustment for diversification. Our
        estimates of our reserve variability may not be comparable to those of other companies
        because there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such
        presentations. Our recorded reserves reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities and
        our actuarial methodologies focus on developing such point estimates, we calculate the
        ranges subsequently, based on the historical variability of such reserves.

Asbestos and Environmental Exposures.

We
        continue to receive claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts, asserting
        injuries and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous
        substances, including asbestos. Environmental claims typically assert liability for (a) the
        mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property
        damage caused by the


release
        of hazardous substances into the land, air or water. Asbestos claims typically assert
        liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from
        asbestos or products containing asbestos.

Our
        reserves include an estimate of our ultimate liability for A&E claims. Our A&E
        liabilities emanate from Mt. McKinley’s direct insurance business and Everest
        Re’s assumed reinsurance business. There are significant uncertainties surrounding
        our estimates of our potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a)
        potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or
        property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental
        contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or liability for
        asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and judicial
        interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to
        involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions concerning
        interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g) uncertainty
        regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental
        exposure.

With
        respect to asbestos claims in particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent
        years that further compound the difficulty in estimating our liability. These developments
        include: (a) the significant growth over a short period of time in the number of claims
        filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar and including claims against
        defendants who may only have a “peripheral” connection to asbestos; (b) a
        disproportionate percentage of claims filed by individuals with no functional injury, which
        should have little to no financial value but that have increasingly been considered in jury
        verdicts and settlements; (c) the growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy
        filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims (including, more recently, bankruptcy
        filings in which companies attempt to resolve their asbestos liabilities in a manner that
        is prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers from participating in the negotiation of
        asbestos related bankruptcy reorganization plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a
        small number of states that favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims where
        coverage is sought under the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than
        the product liability portion; (f) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the
        worst procedural abuses; (g) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos
        claimants, especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some
        states to address asbestos litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or
        the U.S. Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation. Anecdotal evidence suggests
        that new claims filing rates have decreased, that new filings of asbestos-driven
        bankruptcies have decreased and that various procedural and legislative reforms are
        beginning to diminish the potential ultimate liability for asbestos losses.

We
        believe that these uncertainties continue to render reserves for A&E, and particularly
        asbestos losses, significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves
        for other types of losses. We establish reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of
        management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for us or our ceding
        companies.

In
        connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E
        claims, LM provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the first
        $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley’s reserves as of September
        19, 2000 and The Prudential guaranteed LM’s obligations to Mt. McKinley. Coverage
        under this reinsurance agreement was exhausted as of December 31, 2003.

We have
        direct relationships with Mt. McKinley policyholders and we attempt to uphold our
        contractual rights and assert valid defenses to coverage where appropriate. The
        uncertainties inherent in asbestos coverage and bankruptcy litigations have provided us the
        opportunity to engage in settlement negotiations with a number of policyholders who have
        potentially significant asbestos liabilities. Those discussions are aimed at achieving
        reasonable negotiated settlements that limit Mt. McKinley’s liability to a given
        policyholder to a sum certain. Because of the risks and uncertainties inherent in
        litigation, we cannot be certain that this approach will lead to a negotiated settlement in
        the range expected by us in each or every instance. Between 2004 and 2006, we


concluded settlements or reached agreement in principle with 16 of our high
        profile policyholders. We currently have identified 7 policyholders based on their past
        claim activity and/or potential future liabilities as “high profile
        policyholders” and we attempt to negotiate with such policyholders, in part because
        their exposures have developed to the point where we and the policyholder have sufficient
        information to be motivated to settle. We believe that this active approach will ultimately
        result in a more cost-effective liquidation of Mt. McKinley’s liabilities than a
        passive approach, although it may also introduce additional variability in Mt.
        McKinley’s losses and cash flows as reserves are adjusted to reflect the developments
        in litigation, negotiations and, ultimately, potential settlements.

There is
        little potential for similar settlements of our reinsurance asbestos claims where we have
        no direct relationships with the insureds. Our ceding companies have the direct obligation
        to insureds and are responsible for their own claim settlements. They are not consistently
        prompt in developing and providing claim settlement information to their reinsurers, which
        can introduce inconsistencies and significant delays in the reporting of asbestos
        claims/exposures to reinsurers, including us. These delays not only extend the timing of
        reinsurance claim settlements, but also limit the available information from which
        reinsurers, including us, estimate their ultimate exposure. See the discussion below under
        the heading “Financial Condition – Loss and LAE Reserves”.

Due to
        the uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate losses attributable to A&E, and
        particularly asbestos, may be subject to more variability than are non-A&E reserves and
        such variation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
        operations and/or cash flows. See also Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
        Statements.

Reinsurance Receivables.

We have purchased
        reinsurance to reduce our exposure to adverse claim experience, large claims and
        catastrophic loss occurrences. Our ceded reinsurance provides for recovery from reinsurers
        of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances. Such reinsurance does
        not relieve us of our obligation to our policyholders. In the event our reinsurers are
        unable to meet their obligations under these agreements or are able to successfully
        challenge losses ceded by us under the contracts, we will not be able to realize the full
        value of the reinsurance receivable balance. To minimize exposure from uncollectible
        reinsurance receivables, we have a reinsurance security committee that evaluates the
        financial strength of each reinsurer prior to our entering into a reinsurance arrangement.
        In some cases, we may hold full or partial collateral for the receivable, including letters
        of credit, trust assets and cash. Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business
        written in the U.S. are generally required to secure their obligations. We have established
        reserves for uncollectible balances based on our assessment of the collectibility of the
        outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the reserve for uncollectible
        balances was $173.0 million and $87.0 million, respectively. Management believes that
        adequate provision has been made for our uncollectible balances. Actual uncollectible
        amounts may vary, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period
        in which the change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated
        Financial Statements and “Financial Condition – Reinsurance Receivables”
        below.

Premiums Written and Earned.

Premiums written
        by us are earned ratably over the coverage periods of the related insurance and reinsurance
        contracts. We establish unearned premium reserves to cover the unexpired portion of each
        contract. Such reserves are computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data
        received from ceding companies. Premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not yet
        been reported to us, are estimated and accrued. Because of the inherent lag in the
        reporting of written and earned premiums by our ceding companies, we use standard accepted
        actuarial methodologies to estimate earned but not reported premium at each financial
        reporting date. These earned but not reported premiums are combined with reported earned
        premiums to comprise our total premiums earned for determination of our incurred losses and
        loss and LAE reserves. Commission expense and incurred losses related to the change in
        earned but not reported premium are included in current period company and segment
        financial results. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
        Statements.


The
        following table displays the estimated components of earned but not reported premiums by
        segment for the periods indicated:

Investment Valuation.

Our fixed income
        investments are classified for accounting purposes as available for sale and are carried at
        market value in our consolidated balance sheets. Our actively managed equity securities are
        also held as available for sale and are carried at fair value at December 31, 2007, due to
        the adoption of FAS 159 effective January 1, 2007. In prior periods our equity securities
        were carried at market value; however, there is no practical distinction between fair value
        and market value for our securities since all are actively traded. Most securities we own
        are traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available. We hold some
        privately placed securities, less than 0.5% of the portfolio that are either valued by
        brokers or an investment advisor. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our investment portfolio
        included $623.6 million and $442.5 million, respectively, of limited partnership
        investments whose values are reported pursuant to the equity method of accounting. We carry
        these investments at values provided by the managements of the limited partnerships and due
        to inherent reporting lags, the carrying values are based on values as of dates from one
        month to one quarter prior to our financial statement date. In 2005, we owned interest only
        strips that were accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20, which sets forth the rules
        for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value due to
        impairment.

As of
        December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had net unrealized gains, net of tax, of $73.2 million and
        $302.9 million, respectively. Gains and losses from market fluctuations are reflected as
        comprehensive income for the fixed income portfolio and also for the equity portfolio prior
        to January 1, 2007. Subsequent to January 1, 2007, gains and losses from market
        fluctuations for the equity portfolio are reflected as realized capital gains and losses in
        accordance with the provisions of FAS 159. Market value declines for the fixed income
        portfolio, which are considered other than temporary impairments are reflected in the
        income statement as realized capital losses. We consider many factors when determining
        whether a market value decline is other than temporary, including: (1) the length of time
        the market value has been below book value, (2) the credit strength of the issuer, (3) the
        issuer’s market sector, (4) the length of time to maturity and (5) for asset backed
        securities, increases in prepayments and underlying default rates. If management
        assessments change in the future, we may ultimately record a realized loss after management
        originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary. See also Note 1 of Notes to
        the Consolidated Financial Statements.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Cash
        and Invested Assets.

Aggregate invested assets, including cash
        and short-term investments, were $14,936.2 million at December 31, 2007, up by $979.1
        million, compared to $13,957.1 million at December 31, 2006. This increase is primarily the
        result of $854.4 million of cash flows from operations, $395.6 million of net proceeds from
        the long term debt issuance, $100.6 million of realized capital gains on equity securities,
        $167.4 million from foreign exchange and $18.2 million from share-based compensation,
        partially offset by the repurchase in the open market of 2.5 million common shares for
        $241.6 million, $210.0 million of trust preferred securities redemption, $121.4 million in
        dividends to shareholders and $21.4 million of unrealized depreciation, primarily on fixed
        maturities due to rising interest rates.

Our
        principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet our insurance and
        reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a
        high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, we view our
        investment portfolio as having two components: 1) the investments needed to satisfy
        outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by our shareholders’
        equity.

For
        outstanding liabilities, we invest in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities
        with an average credit quality of Aa, as rated by Moody’s, an independent investment
        rating service. We continually adjust our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments in
        light of our current and projected operating results, market conditions and tax position.
        This fixed maturity portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional
        investment manager using portfolio guidelines developed by us.

Over the
        past few years, we have reallocated our shareholders’ equity investment portfolio to
        include 1) publicly traded equity securities, primarily individual equity securities
        intended to emulate the performance of specific exchange traded funds or equity indexes or
        exchange traded funds, and 2) private equity limited partnership investments. The objective
        of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the
        investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return
        asset classes. We have limited our allocation to these asset classes because of 1) the
        potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these investments on
        regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. At December 31, 2007, the market
        value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities approximated 38% of
        shareholders’ equity.


The
        tables below summarize the composition and characteristics of our investment portfolio for
        the periods indicated:

The
        classification shift for our equity securities reflects the adoption of FAS 159 effective
        January 1, 2007.

The
        following table provides a comparison of our total return by asset class relative to
        broadly accepted industry benchmarks for the periods indicated:

Reinsurance Receivables.

Reinsurance
        receivables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled $666.2 million at December 21, 2007 and
        $772.8 million at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, $176.1 million, or 26.4%, was
        receivable from Transatlantic; $152.1 million, or 22.8%, was receivable from Founders, for
        which the Company has established a $151.4 million provision for uncollectible reinsurance;
        $100.0 million, or 15.0%, was receivable from Continental; $54.6 million, or 8.2%, was
        receivable from Munich Re; $45.4 million, or 6.8%, was receivable from LM; $38.5 million,
        or 5.8%, was receivable from Ace and $37.7 million, or 5.7%, was receivable from Berkley.
        The receivable from Continental is collateralized by a funds held arrangements under which
        we have retained the premium payments due the retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for
        such amounts and reduced such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire. No
        other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of our receivables.

Loss
        and LAE Reserves.

Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled $9,040.6
        million at December 31, 2007 and $8,840.1 million at December 31, 2006. The increase in
        2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in our asbestos reserves, partially offset
        by favorable reserve development and the payout during 2007 of catastrophe reserves held as
        of December 31, 2006.


The
        following tables summarize gross outstanding loss and LAE reserves by segment, classified
        by case reserves and IBNR reserves, for the periods indicated:

Changes
        in earned premiums and business mix, reserve re-estimations, catastrophe losses and changes
        in catastrophe loss reserves and claim settlement activity all impact loss and LAE reserves
        by segment and in total. The increase in the December 31, 2007 reserves for A&E
        reflects the impact of a re-evaluation reserve analysis undertaken in the fourth quarter of
        2007 in response to changes we observed in the reported loss trends on these
        reserves.

Our loss
        and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims.
        We continuously re-evaluate our reserves, including re-estimates of prior period reserves,
        taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss
        and claim experience. Changes in reserves resulting from such re-evaluations are reflected
        in incurred losses in the period when the re-evaluation is made. Our analytical methods and
        processes operate at multiple levels including individual contracts, groupings of like
        contracts, classes and lines of business, internal business units, segments, legal
        entities, and in the aggregate. In order to set appropriate reserves, we make qualitative
        and quantitative analyses and judgments at these various levels. Additionally, the
        attribution of reserves, changes in reserves and incurred losses among accident years
        requires qualitative and quantitative adjustments and allocations at these various levels.
        We utilize actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner
        intended to assure the accuracy and consistency of our reserving practices. Nevertheless,
        our reserves are estimates, which are subject to variation, which may be
        significant.

There
        can be no assurance that reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase
        in the future, possibly by a material amount. However, we believe that our existing
        reserves and reserving methodologies


lessen
        the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on our
        financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In this context, we note that
        over the past 10 years, our past calendar year operations have been affected variably by
        effects from prior period reserve re-estimates, with such effects ranging from a favorable
        $26.4 million in 2005, representing 0.5% of the net prior period reserves for the year in
        which the adjustment was made, to an unfavorable $249.4 million in 2004, representing 3.7%
        of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made. We have
        noted that variability had increased for years 2002 to 2004 and we have taken actions to
        attempt to reduce year to year variability prospectively.

We have
        included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by our actuaries, which have been
        developed through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. Our presentation of
        this information may not be directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies
        as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such
        presentations. Our recorded reserves are an aggregation of our best point estimates for
        approximately 200 reserve groups and reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities.
        Our actuarial methodologies develop point estimates rather than ranges and the ranges are
        developed subsequently based upon historical and prospective variability
        measures.

The
        following table below represents the reserve levels and ranges for each of our business
        segments for the period indicated:

(1)

There can be no assurance that reserves will not ultimately
                        exceed the indicated ranges.

(2)

Although totals are displayed for both the low and high
                        range amounts, because of the statistical methods employed, the range of
                        the total is not equal to the sum of the ranges of the segments.

Depending on the specific segment, the range derived for the loss reserves,
        excluding reserves for A&E exposures, ranges from minus 9.4% to minus 16.3% for the low
        range and from plus 9.4% to plus 16.3% for the high range. Both the higher and lower ranges
        are associated with the Specialty Underwriting segment. The size of the range is dependent
        upon the level of confidence associated with the outcome. Within each range,
        management’s best estimate of loss reserves is based upon the point estimatederived
        by our actuaries in detailed reserve studies. Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to
        the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development. For
        the above presentation, management has assumed what it believes is a reasonable confidence
        level but notes that there can be no assurance that our claim obligations will not vary
        outside of these ranges.

Additional losses, including those relating to latent injuries, and other
        exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen
        by us or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally,


may
        emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not covered by existing
        retrocessional contracts, could have material adverse effects on our future financial
        condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have
        exposure to insured A&E losses through our Mt. McKinley operation and reinsured A&E
        losses and through Everest Re. In each case, our management and analyses of our exposures
        take into account a number of features of our business that differentiate our exposures
        from many other insurers and reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures.

Mt.
        McKinley began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and increased the
        volume of its writings in 1978. These writings ceased in 1984, giving Mt. McKinley an
        approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure, which is appreciably shorter than
        is the case for many companies with significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to
        changes in and standardization of policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and
        1980s to have been issued without aggregate limits on the product liability coverage;
        policies issued in earlier decades were generally more likely to lack aggregate
        limits.

The vast
        majority of Mt. McKinley’s A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty
        policies, with aggregate coverage limits. Mt. McKinley’s attachment points vary but
        generally are excess of millions, often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying
        coverage. The excess nature of most of Mt. McKinley’s policies also offers insulation
        against “non-product” claims (for example, claims arising under general
        liability coverage). Although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to
        non-product claims, such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because
        non-product claims are generally less likely to aggregate since each non-product claim is a
        separate loss; whereas for product claims, all claims related to a given product
        “aggregate” as one loss. Environmental claims arise under general liability
        coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these claims tend to create exposure for
        primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies.

Everest
        Re was formed in 1973 but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under
        which A&E exposures generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E
        exposures beginning in 1984 through contract exclusions. Therefore, Everest Re has an
        approximate 11-year window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many long
        established reinsurance companies. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re mainly
        wrote property business, which generally is not exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re
        reinsured both primary and excess policies. However, its claim experience indicates that
        the majority of its exposure was on excess policies, similar to those directly written by
        Mt. McKinley.


Asbestos and Environmental Exposures.

The
        following table summarizes incurred losses and outstanding loss reserves with respect to
        A&E reserves on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for the periods
        indicated:

At
        December 31, 2007, the gross reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $144.5 million
        representing case reserves reported by ceding companies, $147.1 million representing
        additional case reserves established by us on assumed reinsurance claims, $148.2 million
        representing case reserves established by us on direct excess insurance claims, including
        Mt. McKinley and $483.0 million representing IBNR reserves.

Asbestos
        reserves represent 92.3% of the outstanding net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2007
        and represents a separate exposure group for monitoring and evaluating reserve
        adequacy.


The
        following tables summarize reserve and claim activity on a gross and net of ceded
        reinsurance basis for our reinsurance and direct asbestos exposures:

Ultimate
        loss projections for asbestos and environmental liabilities cannot be accomplished using
        standard actuarial techniques. In response to our recent asbestos experience, and in view
        of industry asbestos experience, we completed a detailed study of our experience and our
        cedants’ exposures and also considered recent industry


trends.
        Our Claims Department undertook a contract by contract analysis of its direct business and
        projected those findings to its assumed reinsurance business. Our actuaries utilized nine
        methodologies to project our potential ultimate liabilities including projections based on
        internal data and assessments, extrapolations of non-public and publicly available data for
        our cedants and benchmarking against industry data and experience. As a result of this
        study and claims notifications and additional information received from cedants and
        insureds, we increased our gross reinsurance asbestos reserves by $250.0 million and
        increased our gross direct asbestos reserves by $75.0 million in the fourth quarter of
        2007. This $325.0 million of gross reserve strengthening was the primary driver of the
        $405.0 million of gross incurred asbestos losses for the year ended December 31, 2007.
        Given our recent study and loss trends for these exposures, we believe our reserves at
        December 31, 2007 make adequate provisions for our asbestos losses. Nevertheless, given
        historical experience associated with asbestos claims, we cannot provide assurances that
        our current reserves are adequate and it is possible that our ultimate losses may exceed
        our estimate by a material amount.

Industry
        analysts use the “survival ratio” to compare the A&E reserves among
        companies with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a
        company’s current net reserves by the three year average of annual paid losses.
        Hence, the survival ratio equals the number of years that it would take to exhaust the
        current reserves if future loss payments were to continue at historical levels. Using this
        measurement, our net three year asbestos survival ratio was 8.2 years for reinsurance and
        direct business and 13.6 years for the reinsurance business at December 31, 2007. From a
        comparison perspective, A.M. Best published survival ratios as of December 31, 2006, the
        latest available information, of 8.9 years for the overall insurance industry and 9.5 years
        for the reinsurance sector.

Because
        the survival ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and does not
        indicate absolute reserve adequacy, we consider, but do not rely on, the survival ratio
        when evaluating our reserves. In particular, we note that year to year loss payment
        variability can be material. This is due, in part, to our orientation to negotiated
        settlements, particularly on our Mt. McKinley exposures, which significantly reduces the
        credibility and utility of this measure as an analytical tool. During 2007, we made
        asbestos net claim payments of $57.3 million to Mt McKinley high profile claimants where
        the claim was either closed or a settlement had been reached. Such payments, which are
        non-repetitive, distort downward our three year survival ratio for 2007 and will continue
        to do so for 2008 and 2009. Adjusting for such settlements, recognizing that total
        settlements are generally considered fully reserved to an agreed settlement, we consider
        that our adjusted asbestos survival ratio for net unsettled claims is 11.6 years, which is
        closer to prevailing industry norms.

Shareholders’ Equity.

Our
        shareholders’ equity increased to $5,684.8 million as of December 31, 2007 from
        $5,107.7 million as of December 31, 2006, principally due to $839.3 million of net income
        for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by the repurchase of 2.5
        million common shares for $241.6 million and $121.4 million of shareholder dividends. The
        Company’s shareholders’ equity increased to $5,107.7 million as of December 31,
        2006 from $4,139.7 million as of December 31, 2005, principally reflecting $840.8 million
        of net income for 2006, a $54.1 million increase due to net currency translation, a $38.6
        million increase in net share-based compensation activity and a $88.3 million increase in
        net unrealized appreciation on investments, partially offset by $39.0 million of
        shareholder dividends and an increase of $15.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive
        income due to FAS 158 for pensions.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Capital.

Our business operations are in part
        dependent on our financial strength, and the market’s perception of our strength, as
        measured by shareholders’ equity, which was $5,684.8 million and $5,107.7 million at
        December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We possess significant financial flexibility and
        access to the debt and equity markets as a result of our perceived financial strength, as
        evidenced by the financial strength ratings


as
        assigned by independent rating agencies. We continuously monitor our capital and financial
        position, as well as investment and security market conditions and respond
        accordingly.

From
        time to time, we have used open market share repurchases to effectively adjust our capital
        position. In September 2004, our authorization to purchase our shares was amended to
        authorize the repurchase of up to 5 million shares and during 2007, we repurchased 2.5
        million shares under this authorization. We made no such purchases in 2006 or in 2005.
        Outside of our open market repurchase program, we repurchased 20,866 shares in 2007 and
        21,384 shares in 2006 from employees in connection with restricted share vestings where
        individual employees chose to discharge withholding tax liabilities on vesting shares by
        the surrender of a portion of such shares. At December 31, 2007, there remained 2.5 million
        shares under the repurchase authorization.

On
        December 1, 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, as a
        Well Known Seasoned Issuer under the new registration and offering revisions to the
        Securities Act of 1933. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group is
        authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid
        securities, Holdings is authorized to issue debt securities and Everest Re Capital Trust
        III (“Capital Trust III”) is authorized to issue trust preferred
        securities.

•

On April 26, 2007, Holdings completed a public offering of
                        $400.0 million principal amount of 6.6% fixed to floating rate long term
                        subordinated notes with a scheduled maturity date of May 15, 2037 and a
                        final maturity date of May 1, 2067. The net proceeds were used to redeem
                        the 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities of Holdings on November 15,
                        2007, and for general corporate purposes.

•

On December 1, 2005, we issued 2,298,000 of our common
                        shares at a price of $102.89 per share, which resulted in $236.4 million of
                        proceeds before expenses and Holdings sold Group shares it acquired in 2002
                        at a price of $102.89 per share, which resulted in $46.5 million of
                        proceeds before expenses. Expenses incurred for this transaction were
                        approximately $0.3 million.

Liquidity.

Our principal investment objectives
        are to ensure funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations and to
        maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified
        investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, we view our investment portfolio as
        having two components; 1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2)
        investments funded by our shareholders’ equity.

For
        outstanding liabilities, we invest in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities
        with an average credit quality of Aa, as rated by the independent investment rating service
        of Moody’s. Our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted
        continuously, consistent with our current and projected operating results, market
        conditions and our tax position. This fixed maturity portfolio is externally managed by an
        independent, professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by
        us.

Over the
        past few years, we have reallocated our shareholders’ equity investment portfolio to
        include 1) publicly traded equity securities and 2) private equity limited partnership
        investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the
        risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of
        the portfolio to higher return asset classes. We have limited our allocation to these asset
        classes because 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these
        investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. At December 31, 2007,
        the market value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities approximated
        38% of shareholders’ equity.

Our
        liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive
        cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to
        disbursements for claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period
        after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are
        generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and


investment income provides additional funding for loss payments. Our net
        cash flows from operating activities were $854.4 million, $636.3 million and $1,070.6
        million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally,
        these cash flows reflected net tax payments of $282.6 million, $46.6 million and $110.9
        million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively; net catastrophe
        loss payments of $443.1 million, $896.5 million and $459.7 million for the years ended
        December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively; and net A&E payments of $71.6 million,
        $45.5 million and $137.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively. The increase in net cash flows from operations in 2007 compared with 2006 was
        primarily due to lower claim payments on catastrophes, partially offset by increased tax
        payments. Correspondingly, the decrease in net cash flows from operations in 2006 compared
        with 2005 was primarily due to higher claim payments on catastrophes combined with lower
        premium volume.

If
        disbursements for claims and benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating
        expenses exceed premium inflows, cash flow from insurance operations would be negative. The
        effect on cash flow from operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment
        income. Additionally, cash flow from investment maturities and dispositions, both short
        term investments and longer term maturities, would further mitigate the impact on total
        cash flow.

As the
        timing of payments for claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, we maintain
        portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term
        investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims. At December 31, 2007
        and December 31, 2006 we held cash and short-term investments of $2,476.3 million and
        $1,556.4 million, respectively. In addition to these cash and short-term investments at
        December 31, 2007, we had $585.2 million, at fair value, of available for sale fixed
        maturity securities maturing within one year or less, $2,588.4 million maturing within one
        to five years and $6,942.7 million maturing after five years. Our $1,560.0 million of
        equity securities are comprised primarily of publicly traded securities that can be easily
        liquidated. We believe that these fixed maturity and equity securities, in conjunction with
        the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide adequate sources
        of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future. We do not anticipate
        selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but have the
        ability to do so. Sales of securities might result in realized capital gains or losses and
        we note that at December 31, 2007 we had $132.0 million of net pre-tax unrealized
        appreciation, comprised of $231.4 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation and $99.4
        million of pre-tax unrealized depreciation.

Management expects the trend of positive cash flow from operations, which in
        general reflects the strength of overall pricing, to persist over the near term. In the
        intermediate and long term, the trend will be impacted by the extent to which competitive
        pressures affect overall pricing in our markets and the extent to which we successfully
        maintain our strategy of emphasizing underwriting profitability.

Effective July 27, 2007, Group, Bermuda Re and Everest International
        Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Everest International”) entered into a new five year,
        $850.0 million senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, replacing the December
        8, 2004, senior credit facilities, which would have expired on December 8, 2007. Both the
        July 27, 2007 and December 8, 2004 senior credit facilities are referred to as the
        “Group Credit Facility”. Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the
        Group Credit Facility, which consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $350.0
        million of revolving credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the
        issuance of unsecured standby letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall,
        at the Company’s option, be either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an
        adjusted LIBOR plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of (a) the prime commercial
        lending rate established by Wachovia Bank or (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per
        annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depends on
        Group’s senior unsecured debt rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500.0
        million for the issuance of standby letters of credit on a collateralized basis.


The
        Group Credit Facility requires Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater
        than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a minimum net worth. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to
        the sum of $3,575.4 million plus 25% of consolidated net income for each of Group’s
        fiscal quarters, for which statements are available ending on or after January 1, 2007 and
        for which consolidated net income is positive, plus 25% of any increase in consolidated net
        worth during such period attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. As
        of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all Group Credit Facility
        covenants.

At
        December 31, 2007, $22.0 million and $287.9 million were used under tranche one and tranche
        two of the Group Credit Facility, respectively. At December 31, 2006, $185.4 million was
        used under tranche two of the Group Credit Facility.

Effective August 23, 2006, Holdings entered into a new five year, $150.0
        million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, replacing the October
        10, 2003 three year senior revolving credit facility, which expired on October 10, 2006.
        Both the August 23, 2006 and October 10, 2003 senior revolving credit agreements, which
        have similar terms, are referred to as the “Holdings Credit Facility”. Citibank
        N.A. is the administrative agent for the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit
        Facility is used for liquidity and general corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility
        provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by
        Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) a periodic fixed rate
        equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus an applicable margin. The Base Rate means a fluctuating
        interest rate per annum in effect from time to time to be equal to the higher of (a) the
        rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank as its prime rate or 0.5% per annum above
        the Federal Funds Rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. The amount of margin and
        the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings’ senior
        unsecured debt rating.

The
        Holdings Credit Facility requires Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not
        greater than 0.35 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its statutory surplus at $1.5 billion
        plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future aggregate capital contributions
        after December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2007, Holdings was in compliance with all
        Holdings Credit Facility covenants.

At
        December 31, 2007, $17.2 million was used under the Holdings Credit Facility. At December
        31, 2006, there were no borrowings under the Holdings Credit Facility.

Interest
        expense and fees incurred in connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings
        Credit Facility were $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended
        December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Exposure to Catastrophes.

Like other insurance
        and reinsurance companies, we are exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a
        single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other
        catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. A large catastrophic event can be
        expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties, facultative
        certificates and across lines of business.

We focus
        on potential losses that could result from any single event, or series of events as part of
        our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate exposures to catastrophic events.
        Accordingly, we employ various techniques to estimate the amount of loss we could sustain
        from any single catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These techniques range from
        non-modeled deterministic approaches, such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in
        catastrophe prone zones and applying historic damage factors, to modeled approaches that
        scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation
        techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic
        basis.

No
        single universal model is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of
        loss in all global geographic regions in which we conduct business. In addition, the form,
        quality and granularity of underwriting


exposure
        data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements
        for our licensed models, which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss
        projections. Further, the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be
        combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units. The
        combination of techniques potentially adds to the imprecision of our estimates. Also, while
        most models have been updated to better incorporate factors that contributed to
        unprecedented industry storm losses in 2004 and 2005, such as flood, storm surge and demand
        surge, catastrophe model projections are inherently imprecise. In addition, uncertainties
        with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant
        uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long term frequency and severity
        data.

Nevertheless, when combined with traditional risk management techniques and
        sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price
        catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with
        which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for
        individual and multiple events.

Projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the PML.
        We define PML as anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by
        a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a
        hurricane or earthquake. The PML will vary depending upon the severity of modeled simulated
        losses and the make-up of the in force book of business. The projected severity levels are
        described in terms of “return periods”, such as “100-year events”
        and “250-year events”. For example, a 100-year PML corresponds to the estimated
        loss from a single event which has a 1% probability of being exceeded in a twelve month
        period. Conversely, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss from a single event
        will fall below the indicated PML. It is important to notes that PMLs are estimates.
        Modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model. As a result, there
        can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual
        losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled
        event PML.

From an
        enterprise risk management perspective, management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe
        loss exposure the Company may underwrite. The limits are revised periodically based on a
        variety of factors, including but not limited to the Company’s financial resources
        and expected earnings and risk/reward analyses of the business being
        underwritten.

As of
        January 1, 2008, management estimated that the projected economic loss from its largest
        100-year event does not exceed $600 million or about 10% of shareholders’ equity.
        Economic loss is the gross PML reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew
        coverage and income taxes. The impact of income taxes on the PML depends on the
        distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate
        reinsurance. Management also monitors and controls its largest PMLs at multiple points
        along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and
        1,000 year return periods. This process enables management to identify and control exposure
        accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk, underwriting and
        capital management decisions.

Our
        catastrophe loss projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed
        as part of a formal risk management review process.

We
        believe that our greatest worldwide 1 in 100 year exposure to a single catastrophic event
        is to a hurricane affecting the U.S. southeast coast, where we estimate we have a gross PML
        exposure of $888 million. See also table under “Risk Management and Retrocession
        Arrangements”.


If such
        a single catastrophe loss were to occur, management estimates that the economic loss to us
        would be approximately $564 million. The impact represents approximately 10% of our capital
        as of January 1, 2008. The estimate involves multiple variables, including which Everest
        entity would experience the loss, and as a result there can be no assurance that this
        amount would not be exceeded.

We may
        purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or
        aggregation of exposures across some or all of our operations. Reinsurance purchasing
        decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing,
        terms, conditions and availability of coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective
        protection. The amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time, reflecting our view
        of our exposures and the cost of reinsurance.

For
        2005, and through 2007, we have not purchased corporate retrocessional protection and have
        generally de-emphasized the purchase of specific reinsurance by our underwriters,
        reflecting our view that our exposures, in the context of our capital, financial position
        and current market pricing, do not warrant reinsurance purchases at current price levels.
        See ITEM 1, “Business - Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession
        Arrangements” for further details.

Contractual Obligations.

The following table
        shows our contractual obligations for the period indicated:

(1)

Interest expense on 6.6% long term notes is assumed to be
                        fixed through contractual term.

(2)

Loss and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of losses
                        from claim and related settlement costs. Both the amounts and timing of
                        such payments are estimates, and the inherent variability of resolving
                        claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash
                        flows uncertain. Therefore, the ultimate amount and timing of loss and LAE
                        payments could differ from our estimates.

The
        contractual obligations for senior notes, long term notes and junior subordinated debt are
        the responsibility of Holdings. We have sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and
        access to capital markets to satisfy these obligations. Holdings generally depends upon
        dividends from Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary for its funding, capital
        contributions from Group or access to the capital markets. Our various operating insurance
        and reinsurance subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle
        outstanding reserves for losses and LAE. Management believes that we, and each of our
        entities, have sufficient financial resources or ready access thereto, to meet all
        obligations.

Dividends.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we declared and paid shareholder
        dividends of $121.4 million, $39.0 million and $25.4 million, respectively. As an insurance
        holding company, we are partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from
        our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to our shareholders. The payment of dividends to
        Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to Delaware regulatory
        restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda
        insurance regulatory restrictions.


Management expects that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such
        restrictions should not affect Everest Re’s ability to declare and pay dividends
        sufficient to support Holdings’ general corporate needs and that Holdings and Bermuda
        Re will have the ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Group’s
        general corporate needs. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, Everest Re
        paid dividends to Holdings of $245.0 million, $100.0 million and $75.0 million,
        respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, Bermuda Re paid
        dividends to Group of $0.0 million, $60.0 million and $45.0 million, respectively. See ITEM
        1, “Business – Regulatory Matters – Dividends” and Note 16 of Notes
        to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Application of New Accounting Standards.

In
        November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 115-1,
        “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
        Investments” (“FAS 115-1”), which is effective for reporting periods
        beginning after December 15, 2005. FAS 115-1 addresses the determination as to when an
        investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the
        measurement of an impairment loss. FAS 115-1 also includes accounting considerations
        subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain
        disclosures about unrealized losses not recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The
        Company adopted FAS 115-1 prospectively effective January 1, 2006. The Company believes
        that all unrealized losses in its investment portfolio are temporary in nature.

In July
        2006, FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
        Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”),
        which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the
        accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
        statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income
        Taxes” (“FAS 109”). FIN 48 prescribes the recognition and measurement
        criteria for the financial statements for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a
        tax return. Further, FIN 48 expands the required disclosures associated with uncertain tax
        positions. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recorded no adjustment
        in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and no adjustment to beginning
        retained earnings.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements”
        (“FAS 157”), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
        2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early application encouraged. FAS
        157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value consistently in
        GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company adopted FAS 157 as
        of January 1, 2007.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
        Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (“FAS 158”), which is
        effective for employers with publicly traded equity securities as of the end of the fiscal
        year ending after December 15, 2006. FAS 158 requires an employer to (a) recognize in its
        financial statements an asset for a plan’s over funded status or a liability for a
        plan’s under funded status, (b) measure a plan’s assets and its obligations
        that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year and (c)
        recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year
        in which the changes occur as other comprehensive income. The Company adopted FAS 158 for
        the reporting period ended December 31, 2006.

In
        February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial
        Assets and Financial Liabilities - including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115”
        (“FAS 159”), which is effective for employers with publicly traded equity
        securities as of the end of the fiscal year ending after November 15, 2007. FAS 159 permits
        entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
        value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the
        opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets
        and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions.
        The Company adopted FAS 159 as of January 1, 2007.


Market Sensitive Instruments.

The
        SEC’s Financial Reporting Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon
        the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial
        instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments
        (collectively, “market sensitive instruments”). We do not generally enter into
        market sensitive instruments for trading purposes.

Our
        current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality,
        diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an
        adequate level of liquidity. Our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted
        continuously, consistent with our current and projected operating results, market
        conditions and our tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are
        comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, we invest in equity
        securities, which we believe will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment
        portfolio. We have also written a small number of equity index put options.

The
        overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company
        operations. In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment
        asset and liability transactions, together with our capital structure and other factors,
        are used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout
        characteristics for which our investments provide liquidity. This analysis is considered in
        the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit
        quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the
        asset changes that took place during the period.

Interest Rate Risk.

Our $14.9 billion
        investment portfolio at December 31, 2007 is principally comprised of fixed maturity
        securities, which are generally subject to interest rate risk and of which 19.6%, are
        subject to foreign currency rate risk, and equity securities, which are subject to price
        fluctuations. The impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is
        partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated
        liabilities and their associated income statement impact.

Interest
        rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio, including
        short-term investments, from a change in market interest rates. In a declining interest
        rate environment, it includes prepayment risk on the $1,627.2 million of mortgage-backed
        securities in the $10,245.6 million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from
        potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the
        expected yield of the security.

The
        tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax
        unrealized appreciation on our fixed maturity portfolio (including $2,225.7 million of
        short-term investments) for the periods indicated based on upward and downward parallel and
        immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest rates. For legal entities with a U.S.
        dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually. To
        generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment
        expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account. For legal
        entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the involved
        portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various
        interest rate change scenarios.


We had
        $9,040.6 million and $8,840.1 million of reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31,
        2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. These amounts are recorded at their nominal
        value, as opposed to fair value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the
        time value of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the fair value of the
        reserves is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the fair value of the
        reserves decreases and, conversely, as interest rates decline, the fair value increases.
        These movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of
        investments. While the difference between fair value and nominal value is not reflected in
        our financial statements, our financial results will include investment income over time
        from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid. Our loss and loss reserve
        obligations have an expected duration of approximately 3.8 years, which is reasonably
        consistent with our fixed income portfolio. If we were to discount our loss and LAE
        reserves, net of $666.2 million of reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses, the discount
        would be approximately $1.6 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of
        approximately $6.7 billion, representing approximately 54% of the market value of the fixed
        maturity investment portfolio funds.

Equity Risk.

Equity risk is the potential
        change in market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios arising from
        changing equity prices. Our equity investments consist of a diversified portfolio of
        individual securities and exchange traded and mutual funds, which invest principally in
        high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major exchanges. The
        primary objective of the equity portfolio is to obtain greater total return relative to
        bonds over time through market appreciation and income.

The
        tables below display the impact on market value and after-tax unrealized appreciation of a
        10% and 20% change in equity prices up and down for the periods indicated.

Foreign
        Currency Risk.

Foreign currency risk is the potential change in value,
        income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each
        of our non-U.S./Bermuda (“foreign”) operations maintains capital in the
        currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory
        guidelines. Generally, we prefer to maintain the capital of our operations in U.S. dollar
        assets, although this


varies
        by regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation may
        conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which
        it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the
        Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. We mitigate foreign exchange
        exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of our assets to our corresponding
        operating liabilities. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
        No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”, we translate the assets, liabilities
        and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar. This
        translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December
        31, 2007 there has been no material change in exposure to foreign exchange rates as
        compared to December 31, 2006.

The
        tables below display the potential impact of a parallel and immediate 10% and 20% increase
        and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to
        foreign currency exposure for the periods indicated. This analysis includes the after-tax
        impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the
        after-tax impact of translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting
        currency.

Although
        not considered material in the context of our aggregate exposure to market sensitive
        instruments, we have issued six equity index put options based on the S&P 500 index and
        one equity index put option based on the FTSE 100 index, that are market sensitive and
        sufficiently unique to warrant supplemental disclosure.

We sold
        six equity index put options based on the S&P 500 index for total consideration, net of
        commissions, of $22.5 million. These contracts each have a single exercise date, with
        maturities ranging from 12 to 30 years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to
        $1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is at
        or above the strike prices on the exercise dates, which fall between June 2017 and March
        2031. If the S&P 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise
        date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is
        below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December
        31, 2007 index value, we estimate the probability for each contract of the S&P 500
        index falling below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 5.4%. The
        theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise
        dates the S&P 500 index value

were zero. The present value of
        these theoretical maximum payouts using a 6% discount factor is $226.0 million.

We sold
        one equity index put option based on the FTSE 100 index for total consideration, net of
        commissions, of $6.7 million. This contract has an exercise date of July 2020 and a strike
        price of £5,989.75. No amount will be payable under this contract if the FTSE 100
        index is at or above the strike price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index is lower
        than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary
        proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on
        historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2007 index value, we estimate
        the probability that the FTSE 100 index contract will fall below the strike price on the
        exercise date to be less than 9.7%. The theoretical


maximum
        payout under the contract would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was
        zero. The present value of the theoretical maximum payout using a 6.0% discount factor is
        $31.5 million.

Because
        the equity index put options meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133, we report
        the fair value of these instruments in our balance sheet and record any changes to fair
        value in our statement of operations. We have recorded fair values for our obligations on
        these equity put options at December 31, 2007 and 2006 of $39.7 million and $37.5 million,
        respectively; however, we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these transactions
        is likely to require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received or any
        payment at all.

As there
        is no active market for these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based
        on an industry accepted option pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions,
        including those regarding volatility and expected rates of return.

The
        tables below estimate the impact of potential movements in interest rates and the equity
        indices, which are the principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking
        forward from the fair value for the periods indicated. These are estimates and there can be
        no assurance regarding future market performance. The asymmetrical results of the interest
        rate and S&P 500 and FTSE 100 indices shift reflect that the liability cannot fall
        below zero whereas it can increase to its theoretical maximum.

        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As
        required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
        Act”), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
        Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
        defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief
        Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
        and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual
        report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
        Reporting.

Our
        management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over
        financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
        reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
        of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
        detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
        periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
        conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
        deteriorate.


Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
        financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, we used the
        criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated
        Framework

. Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of
        December 31, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on
        those criteria.

The
        effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
        2007, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
        accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

As
        required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief
        Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated our internal control over
        financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the fourth fiscal
        quarter covered by this annual report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
        likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that
        evaluation, there has been no such change during the fourth quarter.

SIGNATURES

Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the
        Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Everest Re Group, Ltd.:

In our
        opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
        fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Everest Re Group, Ltd. and its
        subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of
        its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
        31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
        of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the
        accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
        therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also
        in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
        control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established
        in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
        Commission ("COSO"). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements
        and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over
        financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
        financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
        Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
        financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's internal
        control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
        accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
        States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
        assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
        whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
        evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
        accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
        overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
        reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
        assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
        and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
        included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
        We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As
        discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted SFAS
        No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” and SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
        Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” in 2007.

A
        company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
        reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
        of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
        those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
        reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
        assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
        recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
        generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
        company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
        detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
        that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

F-2

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
        detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
        periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
        conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
        deteriorate.

NOTES TO
        CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years
        Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

1.

SUMMARY
        OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.
        Business and Basis of Presentation.

Everest
        Re Group, Ltd. (“Group”), a Bermuda company, through its subsidiaries,
        principally provides reinsurance and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and international
        markets. As used in this document, “Company” means Group and its
        subsidiaries.

The
        accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
        (“GAAP”). The statements include all of the following domestic and foreign
        direct and indirect subsidiaries of Group: Everest Reinsurance Holdings, Inc.
        (“Holdings”), Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda), Ltd. (“Bermuda Re”),
        Everest International Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Everest International”), Everest
        International Holdings, Ltd., Mt. McKinley Insurance Company (“Mt. McKinley”),
        Everest Global Services, Inc. (“Global Services”), Everest Advisors (UK), Ltd.,
        Everest Advisors (Ireland) Limited, Everest Re Advisors, Ltd., Everest Reinsurance Company
        (“Everest Re”), Everest National Insurance Company (“Everest
        National”), Everest Indemnity Insurance Company (“Everest Indemnity”),
        Everest Security Insurance Company (“Everest Security”), Everest Insurance
        Company of Canada (“Everest Canada”), Mt. Whitney Securities, Inc., Mt.
        McKinley Managers, L.L.C., Workcare Southeast, Inc. and Workcare Southeast of Georgia, Inc.
        All amounts are reported in U.S. dollars.

The
        preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
        estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (and
        disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities) at the date of the financial statements
        and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. All
        intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Ultimate actual results could
        differ, possibly materially, from those estimates.

B.
        Investments.

Fixed
        maturity and market value equity security investments are all classified as available for
        sale. Unrealized appreciation and depreciation, as a result of temporary changes in market
        value during the period, are reflected in shareholders’ equity, net of income taxes
        in “accumulated other comprehensive income”. Actively managed equity securities
        are carried at fair value with fair value re-measurements reflected as net realized capital
        gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
        Unrealized losses on fixed maturities, which are deemed other than temporary, are charged
        to net income as net realized capital losses. Short-term investments are stated at cost,
        which approximates market value. Realized gains or losses on sale of investments are
        determined on the basis of identified cost. For non-publicly traded securities, market
        prices are determined through the use of pricing models that evaluate securities relative
        to the U.S. Treasury yield curve, taking into account the issue type, credit quality and
        cash flow characteristics of each security. For publicly traded securities, market value is
        based on quoted market prices. Retrospective adjustments are employed to recalculate the
        values of asset-backed securities. Each acquisition lot is reviewed to recalculate the
        effective yield. The recalculated effective yield is used to derive a book value as if the
        new yield were applied at the time of acquisition. Outstanding principal factors from the
        time of acquisition to the adjustment date are used to calculate the prepayment history for
        all applicable securities. Conditional prepayment rates, computed with life to date factor
        histories and weighted average maturities, are used to effect the calculation of projected
        and prepayments for pass-through security types. Other invested assets include limited
        partnerships and rabbi trusts. Limited partnerships are accounted for under the equity
        method of accounting, which can be recorded on a monthly or quarterly lag.

F-8

C.
        Uncollectible Receivable Balances.

The
        Company provides reserves for uncollectible reinsurance balances based on
        management’s assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding balances. Such
        reserves were $188.2 million at December 31, 2007 and $99.9 million at December 31,
        2006.

D.
        Deferred Acquisition Costs.

Acquisition costs, consisting principally of commissions and brokerage
        expenses and certain premium taxes and fees incurred at the time a contract or policy is
        issued and that vary with and are directly related to the Company’s reinsurance and
        insurance business, are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related
        premiums are earned, generally one year. Deferred acquisition costs are limited to their
        estimated realizable value by line of business based on the related unearned premiums,
        anticipated claims and claim expenses and anticipated investment income. Deferred
        acquisition costs amortized to income were $961.8 million, $883.3 million and $914.8
        million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The
        present value of in force annuity business is included in deferred acquisition costs. This
        value is amortized over the expected life of the business from the time of acquisition. The
        amortization each year is a function of the gross profits each year in relation to the
        total gross profits expected over the life of the business, discounted at an assumed net
        credit rate.

E.
        Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.

The
        reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) is based on individual
        case estimates and reports received from ceding companies. A provision is included for
        losses and LAE incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) based on past experience. A
        provision is also included for certain potential liabilities relating to asbestos and
        environmental (“A&E”) exposures, which liabilities cannot be estimated
        using traditional reserving techniques. See also Note 3. The reserves are reviewed
        periodically and any changes in estimates are reflected in earnings in the period the
        adjustment is made. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for the
        Company’s losses and LAE. Loss and LAE reserves are presented gross of reinsurance
        receivables and incurred losses and LAE are presented net of reinsurance.

Accruals
        for commissions are established for reinsurance contracts that provide for the stated
        commission percentage to increase or decrease based on the loss experience of the contract.
        Changes in estimates for such arrangements are recorded as commission expense. Commission
        accruals for contracts with adjustable features are estimated based on expected loss and
        LAE.

F.
        Future Policy Benefit Reserve.

Liabilities for future policy benefits on annuity policies are carried at
        their accumulated values. Reserves for policy benefits include both mortality and morbidity
        claims in the process of settlement and IBNR claims. Interest rate assumptions used to
        estimate liabilities for policy benefits range from 3.32% to 5.49%. Actual experience in a
        particular period may vary.

G.
        Premium Revenues.

Written
        premiums are earned ratably over the periods of the related insurance and reinsurance
        contracts. Unearned premium reserves are established relative to the unexpired contract
        period. Such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies or
        estimated using pro rata methods based on statistical data. Reinstatement premiums
        represent additional premium received on reinsurance coverages, most prevalently
        catastrophe related, when limits have been depleted under the original reinsurance contract
        and additional coverage is granted. Written and earned premiums and the related costs,
        which have not yet been reported to the Company, are estimated and accrued. Premiums are
        net of ceded reinsurance.

Annuity
        premiums are recognized as revenue over the premium-paying period of the
        policies.

F-9

H.
        Income Taxes.

Holdings
        and its wholly-owned subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.
        Foreign branches of subsidiaries file local tax returns as required. Group and subsidiaries
        not included in Holdings’ consolidated tax return file separate company U.S. federal
        income tax returns as required. The UK branch of Bermuda Re files a UK income tax return.
        Deferred income taxes have been recorded to recognize the tax effect of temporary
        differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities,
        which arise because of differences between GAAP and income tax accounting rules.

I.
        Foreign Currency.

Assets
        and liabilities relating to foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the
        exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date; revenues and expenses are translated
        into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. Gains
        and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of
        deferred income taxes, are excluded from net income and accumulated in shareholders’
        equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded through
        the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in other income
        (expense).

J.
        Earnings Per Common Share.

Basic
        earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
        common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that
        would occur if options granted under various share-based compensation plans were exercised
        resulting in the issuance of common shares that would participate in the earnings of the
        entity.

Net
        income (loss) per common share has been computed below, based upon weighted average common
        and dilutive shares outstanding.

All
        options to purchase common shares at the end of 2007 were included in the computation of
        diluted earnings per share as the average market price of the common shares was greater
        than all of the options’ exercise prices during the relevant period. Options to
        purchase 310,200 common shares at prices ranging from $95.485 to $99.980 per share were
        outstanding at the end of 2006 and options to purchase 315,000 common shares at prices
        ranging from $95.050 to $95.485 per share were outstanding at the end of 2005 but were not
        included in the computation of earnings per diluted share for 2006 and 2005, respectively,
        because the options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of
        the common shares. All outstanding options expire on or between September 25, 2008 and
        February 21, 2017.

F-10

K.
        Segmentation.

The
        Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S.
        Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. See also Note 20.

L.
        Derivatives.

The
        Company sold seven equity index put option contracts, which are outstanding. These
        contracts meet the definition of a derivative under Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards (“FAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
        Hedging Activities” (“FAS 133”). The Company’s position in these
        contracts is unhedged and is accounted for as a derivative in accordance with FAS 133.
        Accordingly, these contracts are carried at fair value and are recorded in “Other
        liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets and changes in fair value are
        recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income
        (loss).

M.
        Deposit Assets and Liabilities.

In the
        normal course of its operations, the Company may enter into contracts that do not meet the
        risk transfer provisions of FAS No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of
        Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts”. Such contracts are accounted for using
        the deposit accounting method and are included in other liabilities. For such contracts,
        the Company originally records deposit liabilities for an amount equivalent to the assets
        received. Actuarial studies are used to estimate the final liabilities under such contracts
        with any change reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
        income (loss).

N.
        Share-Based Employee Compensation.

Prior to
        2002, the Company accounted for its share-based employee compensation plans under the
        recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
        Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB
        25”), and related interpretations. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the
        fair value recognition provisions of FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
        Compensation” (“FAS 123”) prospectively for all employee awards granted,
        modified or settled after January 1, 2002. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
        FAS No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”). See also Note
        18.

Prior to
        January 1, 2002, the compensation cost for the Company’s share-based compensation
        plans was determined based on APB 25. If the fair value at the grant dates for awards
        granted under those plans prior to January 1, 2002 was calculated consistent with the
        method of FAS 123, the Company’s net loss and earnings per share for 2005 would have
        been impacted as indicated below. There is no difference after 2005.

The fair
        value of each option grant accounted for in accordance with APB 25 was estimated on the
        date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
        (i) dividend yields ranging from 0.5% to 0.9%, (ii) expected volatility ranging from 32.9%
        to 45.8%, (iii) risk-free interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 7.0% and (iv) expected lives
        of 7.3 to 7.5 years.

O.
        Policyholder Dividends.

The
        Company issues certain insurance policies with dividend payment features. These
        policyholders share in the operating results of their respective policies in the form of
        dividends declared. Dividends to policyholders are

F-11

accrued
        during the period in which the related premiums are earned and are determined based on the
        terms of the individual policies.

P.
        Application of New Accounting Standards.

In
        November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB
        Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 115-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
        Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“FAS 115-1”),
        which was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. FAS 115-1
        addresses the determination of when an investment is considered impaired, whether the
        impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. An other than
        temporary impairment loss is recorded as a net realized capital loss in the consolidated
        statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which it is
        impaired. FAS 115-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition
        of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized
        losses not recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The Company adopted FAS 115-1
        prospectively effective January 1, 2006. The Company believes that all unrealized losses in
        its investment portfolio are temporary in nature as of December 31, 2007.

In July
        2006, FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
        Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”),
        which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the
        accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
        statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income
        Taxes” (“FAS 109”). FIN 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition
        and measurement criteria for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
        Further, FIN 48 expands the required disclosures associated with uncertain tax positions.
        As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recorded no adjustment in the
        liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and no adjustment to beginning retained
        earnings.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements”
        (“FAS 157”). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
        fair value consistently in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The
        Company adopted FAS 157 as of January 1, 2007.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
        Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (“FAS 158”), which is
        effective for employers with publicly traded equity securities as of the end of the fiscal
        year ending after December 15, 2006. FAS 158 requires an employer to (a) recognize in its
        financial statements an asset for a plan’s over funded status or a liability for a
        plan’s under funded status, (b) measure a plan’s assets and its obligations
        that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year and (c)
        recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan in the
        year in which the changes occur as other comprehensive income. The Company adopted FAS 158
        for the reporting period ended December 31, 2006.

In
        February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial
        Assets and Financial Liabilities - including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115”
        (“FAS 159”). FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial
        instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial
        reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported
        earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to
        apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The Company adopted FAS 159 as of January 1,
        2007.

Q.
        Investments – Interest Only Strips.

During
        2005, the Company invested in interest only strips of mortgage-backed securities
        (“interest only strips”), which were fully liquidated in November,
        2005.

The
        Company accounted for its investment in interest only strips in accordance with Emerging
        Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on
        Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests

F-12

in
        Securitized Financial Assets” (“EITF 99-20”). EITF 99-20 sets forth the
        rules for recognizing interest income on all credit-sensitive mortgage and asset-backed
        securities and certain prepayment-sensitive securities, including agency interest only
        strips, whether purchased or retained in securitization, as well as the rules for
        determining when these securities must be written down to fair value because of impairment.
        EITF 99-20 requires decreases in the valuation of residual interests in securitizations to
        be recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the residual interests through a charge
        to earnings, rather than an unrealized loss in shareholders’ equity, when any portion
        of the decline in fair value is attributable to an impairment loss, as defined by EITF
        99-20. The Company recognized pre-tax and after-tax net realized capital gains of $34.3
        million and $26.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005, related to
        the impairment loss and subsequent sale of the interest only strips.

        INVESTMENTS

The
        amortized cost, market value, and gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of
        available for sale, market value fixed maturity and equity security investments are as
        follows for the periods indicated:

F-13

The
        amortized cost and market value of fixed maturities are shown in the following table by
        contractual maturity. Mortgage-backed securities generally are more likely to be prepaid
        than other fixed maturities. As the stated maturity of such securities may not be
        indicative of actual maturities, the total for mortgage-backed securities is shown
        separately.

The
        changes in net unrealized gains (losses) for the Company’s investments are derived
        from the following sources for the periods indicated:

The
        Company frequently reviews its investment portfolio for declines in market value and
        focuses its attention on securities whose fair value has fallen below 80% of their
        amortized value at the time of review. The Company then assesses whether the decline in
        value is temporary or “other than temporary”. In making its assessment, the
        Company evaluates the current market and interest rate environment as well as specific
        issuer information and the Company’s ability and intent to hold to maturity.
        Generally, a change in a security’s value caused by a change in the market or
        interest rate environment does not constitute an other than temporary impairment, but
        rather a temporary decline in market value. Temporary declines in market value are recorded
        as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income. If the Company determines
        that the decline is “other than temporary”, the carrying value of the
        investment is written down to fair value and a realized loss is recorded in the
        Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The
        Company’s assessments are based on the issuer’s current and expected future
        financial position, timeliness with respect to interest and/or principal payments, speed of
        repayments on asset-backed securities, as well as relevant information provided by rating
        agencies, investment advisors and analysts.

The
        tables below display the aggregate market value and gross unrealized depreciation of fixed
        maturity securities, by investment category and maturity category by length of time that
        individual securities had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for the period
        indicated:

The
        aggregate market value and gross unrealized losses related to investments in an unrealized
        loss position as of December 31, 2007 were $3,964.4 million and $99.4 million,
        respectively. There were no material concentrations of unrealized losses by issuer,
        security type or industry within the fixed maturity portfolio. The $14.4 million of
        unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities that have been in an unrealized loss
        position for less than one year were generally comprised of highly rated government,
        municipal and corporate bonds and the losses were primarily the result of widening credit
        spreads during the latter part of the year. Of these unrealized losses, $11.9 million were
        related to securities that were rated investment grade or better by at least one nationally
        recognized statistical rating organization. The $85.0 million of unrealized losses related
        to fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position for more than one year also
        related primarily to highly rated government, municipal and corporate bonds and were the
        result of widening credit spreads during the latter part of the year. Of these unrealized
        losses, $80.2 million related to securities that were rated investment grade or better by
        at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

The
        Company, given the size of its investment portfolio and capital position, has the ability
        to hold these securities until recovery of market value. In addition, all securities
        currently in an unrealized loss position are current with respect to principal and interest
        payments.

The
        tables below display the aggregate market value and gross unrealized depreciation of fixed
        maturity securities, by investment category and maturity category by length of time that
        individual securities had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for the period
        indicated:

The
        aggregate market value and gross unrealized losses related to investments in an unrealized
        loss position as of December 31, 2006 were $5,635.8 million and $122.8 million,
        respectively. There were no material concentrations of unrealized losses by issuer,
        security type or industry within the fixed maturity portfolio. The $21.9 million of
        unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities that had been in an unrealized loss
        position for less than one year were generally comprised of highly rated government,
        municipal and corporate bonds and the losses were primarily the result of interest rates
        being higher than when the securities were purchased. Of these unrealized losses, $20.6
        million were related to securities that were rated investment grade or better by at least
        one nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The $100.9 million of unrealized
        losses related to fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position for more than
        one year also related primarily to highly rated government, municipal and corporate bonds
        and the losses were the result of interest rates being higher than when the securities were
        purchased. Of these unrealized losses, $94.8 million were related to securities that were
        rated investment grade or better by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating
        organization.

The
        components of net investment income are presented in the table below for the periods
        indicated:

Other
        investment income for 2007, 2006 and 2005 primarily consists of income earned on limited
        partnership investments of $59.2 million, $54.7 million and $11.5 million,
        respectively.

The
        Company had contractual commitments to invest up to an additional $346.6 million in limited
        partnerships at December 31, 2007. These commitments will be funded when called in
        accordance with the partnership agreements, which have investment periods that expire,
        unless extended, through 2014.

The
        components of net realized capital gains (losses) are presented in the table
        below:

Proceeds
        from sales of fixed maturity investments during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $275.6 million,
        $182.9 million and $1,420.3 million, respectively. Gross gains of $2.6 million, $14.9
        million and $89.6 million and gross losses of $16.9 million, $2.1 million and $5.3 million
        were realized on those fixed maturity sales during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
        Proceeds from sales of equity security investments during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $1,547.1
        million, $281.1 million and $218.0 million, respectively. Gross gains of $45.9 million,
        $34.1 million and $16.6 million and gross losses of $22.0 million, $11.8 million and $3.6
        million were realized on those equity sales during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted and implemented FAS 159 for
        its actively managed equity securities. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2007,
        the Company recorded $76.6 million of net realized gains from fair value adjustments in its
        consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Included
        in net realized capital gains for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $8.4 million, $13.3 thousand and
        $7.0 million, respectively, for write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be
        impaired on an other than temporary basis. The 2005 $7.0 million write-down was due to the
        impairment of the interest only strips in accordance with EITF 99-20.

Securities with a carrying value of $1,468.0 million at December 31, 2007
        were on deposit with various state or governmental insurance departments in compliance with
        insurance laws.

        RESERVE FOR LOSSES, LAE AND FUTURE POLICY BENEFIT RESERVE

Reserves
        for losses and LAE.

Activity
        in the reserve for losses and LAE is summarized for the periods indicated:

Gross
        loss and LAE reserves were $9,040.6 million at December 31, 2007 and $8,840.1 million at
        December 31, 2006. The increase in 2007 was primarily attributable to the strengthening of
        asbestos reserves. The decrease in 2006 was primarily attributable to the payment of 2005
        catastrophe losses, which were included in the January 1, 2006 reserve balances, and a
        decrease in earned premiums.

Reinsurance receivables for both paid and unpaid losses were $666.2 million
        at December 31, 2007 and $772.8 million at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, $176.1
        million, or 26.4%, was receivable from Transatlantic Reinsurance Company
        (“Transatlantic”); $152.1 million, or 22.8%, was receivable from Founders
        Insurance Company Limited (“Founders”) for which the Company has established a
        $151.4 million provision for uncollectible reinsurance; $100.0 million, or 15.0%, was
        receivable from Continental Insurance Company (“Continental”), which is
        partially collateralized by funds held; $54.6 million, or 8.2%, was receivable from Munich
        Reinsurance Company (“Munich Re”); $45.4 million, or 6.8%, was receivable from
        LM Property and Casualty Insurance Company (“LM”), whose obligations are
        guaranteed by The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“The Prudential”);
        $38.5 million, or 5.8%, was receivable from Ace Property and Casualty Insurance Company
        (“Ace”) and $37.7 million, or 5.7%, was receivable from Berkley Insurance
        Company (“Berkley”). No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of
        reinsurance receivables.

The
        Company continues to receive claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts,
        asserting injuries and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and
        hazardous substances, including asbestos. Environmental claims typically assert liability
        for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury
        or property damage caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or
        water. Asbestos claims typically assert liability for bodily injury from exposure to
        asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing
        asbestos.

F-18

The
        Company’s reserves include an estimate of the Company’s ultimate liability for
        A&E claims. The Company’s A&E liabilities emanate from Mt. McKinley’s
        direct insurance business and Everest Re’s assumed reinsurance business. All of the
        contracts of insurance and reinsurance under which the Company has received claims during
        the past three years expired more than 20 years ago. There are significant uncertainties
        surrounding the Company’s reserves for its A&E losses.

The
        following table summarizes incurred losses all of which represent adverse loss reserve
        development with respect to A&E reserves gross and net of reinsurance for the periods
        indicated:

At
        December 31, 2007, the gross reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $144.5 million
        representing case reserves reported by ceding companies, $147.1 million representing
        additional case reserves established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $148.2
        million representing case reserves established by the Company on direct excess insurance
        claims, including Mt. McKinley and $483.0 million representing IBNR reserves.

With
        respect to asbestos only, at December 31, 2007, the Company had gross asbestos loss
        reserves of $858.8 million, of which $585.3 million was for assumed business and $273.5
        million was for direct excess business.

In
        response to its recent asbestos experience, and in view of industry asbestos experience,
        the Company completed a detailed study of its experience and its cedants’ exposures
        and also considered recent industry trends. The Company’s Claims Department undertook
        a contract by contract analysis of its direct business and projected those findings to its
        assumed reinsurance business. The Company’s actuaries utilized nine methodologies to
        project potential ultimate liabilities including projections based on internal data and
        assessments, extrapolations of non-public and publicly available data for the
        Company’s cedants and benchmarking against industry data and experience. As a result
        of this study, the Company increased its gross asbestos reserves by $325.0 million
        effective December 31, 2007. The Company has not experienced significant claims activity
        related to environmental exposures other than asbestos. Management believes that its
        A&E reserves make adequate provision for the Company’s ultimate liability,
        however, there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such
        reserves, perhaps by a significant amount.

In
        connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E
        claims, LM provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the first
        $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley’s reserves as of September
        19, 2000 and The Prudential guaranteed LM’s obligations to Mt. McKinley. Coverage
        under this reinsurance agreement was exhausted as of December 31, 2003.

        Policy Benefit Reserve.

Activity
        in the reserve for future policy benefits is summarized for the periods
        indicated:

4. FAIR
        VALUE

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted and implemented FAS 159 for
        its actively managed equity securities. In conjunction with the Company implementing a more
        active management strategy for these securities, FAS 159 provided guidance on accounting
        and presentation of these investments in the Company’s consolidated financial
        statements. Upon adoption of FAS 159, the Company recognized a $250.8 million
        cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, net of $110.3 million of tax. The
        Company recorded $76.6 million net realized capital gains in the consolidated statements of
        operations and comprehensive income (loss) due to fair value re-measurement for the year
        ended December 31, 2007.

As a
        result of early FAS 159 adoption and implementation, the Company also adopted and
        implemented FAS 157. The following table presents the fair value measurement levels for all
        assets and liabilities, which the Company has recorded at fair value as of the period
        indicated:

F-20

The
        following table presents the fixed maturity investments for which fair value was measured
        under level 3 for the period indicated:

The
        fixed maturities reflected as being valued under level 3 were valued by investment brokers
        for which the Company believes reflects fair value, but was unable to verify inputs to the
        valuation methodology.

The
        following table presents the equity index put options for which fair value was measured
        under level 3 for the period indicated:

Since
        there is no active market for these long dated options, their valuation was considered as
        level 3.

F-21

The
        Company sold six equity index put options based on the Standard & Poor’s 500
        (“S&P 500”) index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $22.5
        million. At December 31, 2007, fair value for these equity put options was $31.6 million.
        These contracts each have a single exercise date, with maturities ranging from 12 to 30
        years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No amounts will be payable
        under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is at or above the strike prices on the
        exercise dates, which fall between June 2017 and March 2031. If the S&P 500 index is
        lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due would vary
        proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on
        historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2007 index value, the Company
        estimates the probability for each contract of the S&P 500 index falling below the
        strike price on the exercise date to be less than 5.4%. The theoretical maximum payouts
        under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P 500 index
        value were zero. At December 31, 2007, the present value of these theoretical maximum
        payouts using a 6.0% discount factor was $226.0 million.

The
        Company sold one equity index put option based on the FTSE 100 index for total
        consideration, net of commissions, of $6.7 million. At December 31, 2007, fair value for
        this equity put option was $8.0 million. This contract has an exercise date of July 2020
        and a strike price of £5,989.75. No amount will be payable under this contract if the
        FTSE 100 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index
        is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary
        proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on
        historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2007 index value, the Company
        estimates the probability that the FTSE 100 index contract will fall below the strike price
        on the exercise date to be less than 9.7%. The theoretical maximum payout under the
        contract would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was zero. At December
        31, 2007, the present value of the theoretical maximum payout using a 6.0% discount factor
        and current exchange rate was $31.5 million.

These
        equity index put options meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. The
        Company’s position in these contracts is unhedged. The Company recorded the change in
        fair value as net derivative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and
        comprehensive income (loss) of $2.1 million, $0.4 million and $2.6 million for the years
        ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As there
        is no active market for these instruments, the determination of their fair value is
        calculated using a broadly accepted option pricing model, Black-Scholes, which used the
        following inputs:

        CREDIT LINES

Effective July 27, 2007, Group, Bermuda Re and Everest International
        Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Everest International”) entered into a new five year,
        $850.0 million senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, replacing the December
        8, 2004, senior credit facilities, which would have expired on December 8, 2007. Both the
        July 27, 2007 and December 8, 2004 senior credit facilities are referred to as the
        “Group Credit Facility”. Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the
        Group Credit Facility, which consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $350.0
        million of revolving credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the
        issuance of unsecured standby letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall,
        at the Company’s option, be either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an
        adjusted LIBOR plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of (a) the prime commercial
        lending rate established by Wachovia Bank or (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% per
        annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depends on
        Group’s senior unsecured debt rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500.0
        million for the issuance of standby letters of credit on a collateralized basis.

The
        Group Credit Facility requires Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater
        than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a minimum net worth. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to
        the sum of $3,575.4 million plus 25% of consolidated net income for each of Group’s
        fiscal quarters, for which statements are available ending on or after January 1, 2007 and
        for which consolidated net income is positive, plus 25% of any increase in consolidated net
        worth during such period attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. As
        of December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all Group Credit Facility
        covenants.

At
        December 31, 2007, $22.0 million and $288.0 million were used under tranche one and tranche
        two of the Group Credit Facility, respectively. At December 31, 2006, $185.4 million was
        used under tranche two of the Group Credit Facility.

Effective August 23, 2006, Holdings entered into a new five year, $150.0
        million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, replacing the October
        10, 2003 three year senior revolving credit facility, which expired on October 10, 2006.
        Both the August 23, 2006 and October 10, 2003 senior revolving credit agreements, which
        have similar terms, are referred to as the “Holdings Credit Facility”. Citibank
        N.A. is the administrative agent for the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit
        Facility is used for liquidity and general corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility
        provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by
        Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) a periodic fixed rate
        equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus an applicable margin. The Base Rate means a fluctuating
        interest rate per annum in effect from time to time to be equal to the higher of (a) the
        rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank as its prime rate or (b) 0.5% per annum
        above the Federal Funds Rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. The amount of margin
        and the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings’ senior
        unsecured debt rating.

The
        Holdings Credit Facility requires Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not
        greater than 0.35 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its statutory surplus at $1.5 billion
        plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future aggregate capital contributions
        after December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2007, Holdings was in compliance with all
        Holdings Credit Facility covenants.

At
        December 31, 2007, $17.2 million was used under the Holdings Credit Facility. At December
        31, 2006, there were no borrowings under the Holdings Credit Facility.

Interest
        expense and fees incurred in connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings
        Credit Facility were $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the years ended
        December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

        SENIOR NOTES

On
        October 12, 2004, Holdings completed a public offering of $250.0 million principal amount
        of 5.40% senior notes due October 15, 2014. On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed public
        offerings of $200.0 million principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15, 2010 and
        $250.0 million principal amount of 8.50% senior notes due and retired March 15,

        $35.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Market
        value, which is based on quoted market price at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $235.3
        million and $248.1 million, respectively, for the 5.40% senior notes and $215.9 million and
        $219.8 million, respectively, for the 8.75% senior notes.

        LONG TERM SUBORDINATED NOTES

On April
        26, 2007, Holdings completed a public offering of $400.0 million principal amount of 6.6%
        fixed to floating rate long term subordinated notes with a scheduled maturity date of May
        15, 2037 and a final maturity date of May 1, 2067. During the fixed rate interest period
        from May 3, 2007 through May 14, 2017, interest will be at the annual rate of 6.6%, payable
        semi-annually in arrears on November 15 and May 15 of each year, commencing on November 15,
        2007, subject to Holdings’ right to defer interest on one or more occasions for up to
        ten consecutive years. During the floating rate interest period from May 15, 2017 through
        maturity, interest will be based on the 3 month London Interbank Offered Rate
        (“LIBOR”) plus 238.5 basis points, reset quarterly, payable quarterly in
        arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, subject to
        Holdings’ right to defer interest on one or more occasions for up to ten consecutive
        years. Deferred interest will accumulate interest at the applicable rate compounded
        semi-annually for periods prior to May 15, 2017, and compounded quarterly for periods from
        and including May 15, 2017.

Holdings
        can redeem the long term subordinated notes prior to May 15, 2017, in whole but not in part
        at the applicable redemption price, which will equal the greater of (a) 100% of the
        principal amount being redeemed and (b) the present value of the principal payment on May
        15, 2017 and scheduled payments of interest that would have accrued from the redemption
        date to May 15, 2017 on the long term subordinated notes being redeemed, discounted to the
        redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a discount rate equal to the treasury rate plus
        an applicable spread of either 0.25% or 0.50%, in each case plus accrued and unpaid
        interest. Holdings may redeem the long term subordinated notes on or after May 15, 2017, in
        whole or in part at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest; however,
        redemption on or after the scheduled maturity date and prior to May 1, 2047 are subject to
        a replacement capital covenant. This covenant is for the benefit of certain senior note
        holders and it mandates that Holdings receive proceeds from the sale of another
        subordinated debt issue, of at least similar size, before it may redeem the subordinated
        notes.

Interest
        expense incurred in connection with these long term notes was $17.4 million for the year
        ended December 31, 2007. Market value, which is based on quoted market price at December
        31, 2007, was $349.8 million for the 6.6% long term subordinated notes.

        JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES PAYABLE

On March
        29, 2004, Holdings issued $329.9 million of 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities due
        March 29, 2034 to Everest Re Capital Trust II (“Capital Trust II”). Holdings
        may redeem the junior subordinated debt securities before their maturity at 100% of their
        principal amount plus accrued interest as of the date of redemption. The securities may be
        redeemed, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions at any time on or after March 30,
        2009; or at any time, in whole, but not in part, within 90 days of the occurrence and
        continuation of a determination that the Trust may become subject to tax or the Investment
        Company Act.

F-24

On
        November 14, 2002, Holdings issued $216.5 million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt
        securities due November 15, 2032 to Everest Re Capital Trust (“Capital Trust”).
        Holdings redeemed all of the junior subordinated debt securities at 100% of their principal
        amount plus accrued interest on November 15, 2007.

Fair
        value, which is primarily based on quoted market price of the related trust preferred
        securities at December 31, 2007 and 2006, was $250.8 million and $316.3 million,
        respectively, for the 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities and $221.2 million for the
        7.85% junior subordinated debt securities at December 31, 2006.

Interest
        expense incurred in connection with these junior subordinated notes was $35.3 million,
        $37.4 million and $37.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.

Capital
        Trust II is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Holdings. Capital Trust was dissolved upon
        the completion of the redemption of the trust preferred securities on November 15,
        2007.

Holdings
        considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the trust preferred securities,
        taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by Holdings of Capital Trust
        II’s payment obligations with respect to their trust preferred securities.

Capital
        Trust II will redeem all of the outstanding trust preferred securities when the junior
        subordinated debt securities are paid at maturity on March 29, 2034. The Company may elect
        to redeem the junior subordinated debt securities, in whole or in part, at any time on or
        after March 30, 2009. If such an early redemption occurs, the outstanding trust preferred
        securities would also be proportionately redeemed.

There
        are certain regulatory and contractual restrictions on the ability of Holdings’
        operating subsidiaries to transfer funds to Holdings in the form of cash dividends, loans
        or advances. The insurance laws of the State of Delaware, where Holdings’ direct
        insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, require regulatory approval before those subsidiaries
        can pay dividends or make loans or advances to Holdings that exceed certain statutory
        thresholds. In addition, the terms of Holdings’ Credit Facility (discussed in Note 5)
        require Everest Re, Holdings’ principal insurance subsidiary, to maintain a certain
        statutory surplus level as measured at the end of each fiscal year. At December 31, 2007,
        $2,595.1 million of the $3,269.7 million in net assets of Holdings’ consolidated
        subsidiaries were subject to the foregoing regulatory restrictions.

        LETTERS OF CREDIT

The
        Company has arrangements available for the issuance of letters of credit, which letters are
        generally collateralized by the Company’s cash and investments. The Company’s
        agreement with Citibank is a bilateral letter of credit agreement only. On November 6, 2007
        the Citibank bilateral letter of credit agreement was decreased by $50.0 million to $300.0
        million. All other terms of this agreement remain the same. The Company’s other
        facility, the Wachovia Group Credit Facility, involves a syndicate of lenders (see Note 5
        of the Group Credit Facility), with Wachovia acting as administrative agent. The Citibank
        Holdings Credit Facility involves a syndicate of lenders (see Note 5 of the Holdings Credit
        Facility), with Citibank acting as administrative agent. At December 31, 2007 and 2006,
        letters of credit for $491.1 million and $460.0 million, respectively, were issued and
        outstanding. The letters of credit collateralize reinsurance obligations of the
        Company’s non-U.S. operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s
        letters of credit at December 31, 2007.

10.
        TRUST AGREEMENTS

Certain
        subsidiaries of Group, principally Bermuda Re, have established trust agreements, which
        effectively use the Company’s investments as collateral, as security for assumed
        losses payable to certain non-affiliated ceding companies. At December 31, 2007, the total
        amount on deposit in trust accounts was $115.5 million.

        OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS

The
        future minimum rental commitments, exclusive of cost escalation clauses, at December 31,
        2007 for all of the Company’s operating leases with remaining non-cancelable terms in
        excess of one year are as follows:

All of
        these leases, the expiration terms of which range from 2008 to 2017, are for the rental of
        office space. Rental expense was $9.9 million, $8.5 million and $7.1 million for the years
        ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

12.
        INCOME TAXES

Under
        Bermuda law, no income or capital gains taxes are imposed on Group and its Bermuda
        subsidiaries. The Minister of Finance of Bermuda has also assured Group and its Bermuda
        subsidiaries that, pursuant to The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966, they
        will be exempt until 2016 from imposition of any such taxes.

All the
        income of Group’s U.S. subsidiaries is subject to the applicable federal, foreign,
        state and local taxes on corporations. Additionally, the income of foreign branches of the
        Company’s insurance operating companies, in particular the UK branch of Bermuda Re,
        is subject to various income taxes. The provision for income taxes in the consolidated
        statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) has been determined in accordance
        with the individual income of each entity and the respective applicable tax laws. The
        provision reflects the permanent differences between financial and taxable income relevant
        to each entity. The significant components of the provision are as follows for the periods
        indicated:

F-27

The
        weighted average expected tax provision has been calculated using the pre-tax income (loss)
        in each jurisdiction multiplied by that jurisdiction’s applicable statutory tax rate.
        Reconciliation of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the expected
        tax provision at the weighted average tax rate for the periods indicated is provided
        below:

Deferred
        income taxes reflect the tax effect of the temporary differences between the value of
        assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and such values as measured by the
        U.S. tax laws and regulations. The principal items making up the net deferred income tax
        asset are as follows for the periods indicated:

F-28

The
        Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the
        implementation of FIN 48, the Company did not recognize any increase in the liability for
        unrecognized tax benefits, and therefore did not need to account for any such increase as a
        reduction to the January 1, 2007, balance of retained earnings. A reconciliation of the
        beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The
        entire amount of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if
        recognized.

In 2007,
        the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed its examination of the
        Company’s consolidated U.S. income tax returns for 2003 and 2004 and issued an
        examination report proposing various adjustments. The Company has submitted a formal
        protest and believes that it has a strong chance of prevailing on the issues involved. With
        few exceptions, the Company no longer is subject to U.S. federal, state and local or
        foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003.

The
        Company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in
        income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company accrued and recognized
        approximately $6.0 million in interest and penalties.

The
        Company is not aware of any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total
        amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve
        months of the reporting date.

For U.S.
        income tax purposes the Company has foreign tax credit carryforwards of $48.5 million that
        begin to expire in 2014. In addition, for U.S. income tax purposes the Company has $28.1
        million of Alternative Minimum Tax credits that do not expire. Management believes that it
        is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its net deferred tax
        assets and accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded for the periods
        presented.

Tax
        benefits of $5.2 million and $5.8 million related to share-based compensation deductions
        for 2007 and 2006, respectively, are reflected in the change in shareholders’ equity
        in “additional paid-in capital”.

13.
        REINSURANCE

The
        Company utilizes reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and
        catastrophic loss occurrences. These agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a
        portion of losses and LAE under certain circumstances without relieving the ceding company
        of its obligations to the policyholders. Losses and LAE incurred and premiums earned are
        reported after deduction for reinsurance. In the event that one or more of the reinsurers
        were unable to meet their obligations under these reinsurance agreements, the Company would
        not realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balances. The Company may hold
        partial collateral, including letters of credit and funds held, under these agreements. See
        also Note 1C.

In
        addition, the Company had coverage under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement
        provided by LM in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Mt. McKinley in
        September 2000. This agreement covers 80% or $160.0 million of the first $200 million of
        any adverse loss reserve development on the carried reserves of Mt.

McKinley
        at the date of acquisition and reimburses the Company as such losses are paid by the
        Company. The Prudential continues to guarantee LM’s obligation under this
        agreement.

Premiums
        written and earned and incurred losses and LAE are comprised of the following for the
        periods indicated:

The
        amounts deducted from losses and LAE incurred for net reinsurance recoveries were $114.7
        million, $109.5 million and $95.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
        2005, respectively, see also Note 3.

        EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined
        Benefit Pension Plans.

The
        Company maintains both qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its
        U.S. employees. Generally, the Company computes the benefits based on average earnings over
        a period prescribed by the plans and credited length of service. The Company’s
        non-qualified defined benefit pension plan, affected in October 1995, provides compensating
        pension benefits for participants whose benefits have been curtailed under the qualified
        plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations.

Although
        not required to make contributions under IRS regulations, the Company contributed $3.6
        million and $22.8 million to the qualified plan in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Pension
        expense for the Company’s plans for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
        was $6.4 million, $9.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively.

The
        following table summarizes the status of these defined benefit plans for U.S. employees for
        the periods indicated:

Other
        changes in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2007 are as
        follows:

Net
        periodic benefit cost for U.S. employees included the following components for the periods
        indicated:

The
        estimated transition obligation, actuarial loss and prior service cost that will be
        amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over
        the next year are $0, $230 thousand and $51 thousand, respectively.

The
        weighted average discount rates used to determine net periodic benefit cost for 2007 and
        2006 were 5.94% and 5.50%, respectively. The rate of compensation increase used to
        determine the net periodic benefit cost for

F-33

2007 and
        2006 was 4.50%. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2007 and 2006 was
        8.0% and was based on expected portfolio returns and allocations.

The
        weighted average discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the
        projected benefit obligation for year end 2007 and 2006 were 6.55% and 5.94%,
        respectively.

The
        asset allocation percentages for the qualified benefit plan, by asset category, for the
        periods indicated:

Plan
        assets consist of shares in investment trusts with approximately 65%, 30% and 5% of the
        underlying assets consisting of equity securities, fixed maturities and cash, respectively.
        The Company manages the qualified plan investments for U.S. employees. The assets in the
        plan consist of debt and equity mutual funds. Due to the long term nature of the plan, the
        target asset allocation consists of 70% equities and 30% bonds.

The
        Company expects to contribute approximately $2.4 million in 2008 to the qualified
        plan.

Defined Contribution Plans.

The
        Company also maintains both qualified and non-qualified defined contribution plans
        (“Savings Plan” and “Non-Qualified Savings Plan”, respectively)
        covering U.S. employees. Under the plans, the Company contributes up to a maximum 3% of the
        participants’ compensation based on the contribution percentage of the employee. The
        Non-Qualified Savings Plan provides compensating savings plan benefits for participants
        whose benefits have been curtailed under the Savings Plan due to Internal Revenue Code
        limitations. The Company’s incurred expenses related to these plans were $1.2 million
        in 2007 and $1.0 million in 2006 and 2005.

In
        addition, the Company maintains several defined contribution pension plans covering
        non-U.S. employees. Each non-U.S. office (Canada, London, Belgium, Singapore and Bermuda)
        maintains a separate plan for the non-U.S. employees working in that location. The Company
        contributes various amounts based on salary, age and/or years of service. The contributions
        as a percentage of salary for the branch offices range from 4% to 19%. The contributions
        are generally used to purchase pension benefits from local insurance providers. The
        Company’s incurred expenses related to these plans were $0.7 million, $0.6 million
        and $0.5 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Post-Retirement Plan.

The
        Company sponsors the Retiree Health Plan. This plan provides healthcare benefits for
        eligible retired employees (and their eligible dependants), who have elected coverage. The
        Company currently anticipates that most covered employees will become eligible for these
        benefits if they retire while working for the Company. The cost of these benefits is shared
        with the retiree. The Company accrues the post-retirement benefit expense during the period
        of the employee’s service.

F-35

A
        healthcare inflation rate for pre-Medicare claims of 9% in 2007 was assumed to decrease one
        percentage point annually to 5% in 2011 and then remain at that level. A healthcare
        inflation rate for post-Medicare claims of 5% in 2007 was assumed to remain at that
        level.

Effective December 31, 2007, the healthcare inflation rate for pre-Medicare
        claims is 9% in 2008, decreasing gradually to 5% in 2015. The healthcare inflation rate for
        post-Medicare claims is 7% in 2008, decreasing gradually to 5% in 2015.

Changes
        in the assumed healthcare cost trend can have a significant effect on the amounts reported
        for the healthcare plans. A one percent change in the rate would have the following effects
        on:

The
        weighted average discount rates used to determine net periodic benefit cost for 2007 and
        2006 were 5.94% and 5.50%, respectively.

The

        DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS AND STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Dividend
        Restrictions.

Under
        Bermuda law, Group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would
        reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate value of its
        liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium (additional paid-in capital)
        accounts. Group’s ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is dependent
        upon dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends by insurer subsidiaries
        is limited under Bermuda law and the laws of the various U.S. states in which Group’s
        insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled. The limitations
        are generally based upon net income and compliance with applicable policyholders’
        surplus or minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio requirements as determined in
        accordance with the relevant statutory accounting practices.

Under
        Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is prohibited from declaring or making payment of a dividend if it
        fails to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a long-term
        insurer, Bermuda Re is also unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a
        policyholder unless, after payment of the dividend, the value of the assets in its
        long-term business fund, as certified by its approved actuary, exceeds its liabilities for
        long-term business by at least the $250,000 minimum solvency margin. Prior approval of the
        Bermuda Monetary Authority is required if Bermuda Re’s dividend payments would reduce
        its prior year-end total statutory capital by 15% or more.

Delaware
        law provides that an insurance company which is a member of an insurance holding company
        system and is domiciled in the state shall not pay dividends without giving prior notice to
        the Insurance Commissioner of Delaware and may not pay dividends without the approval of
        the Insurance Commissioner if the value of the proposed dividend, together with all other
        dividends and distributions made in the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (1)
        10% of statutory surplus or (2) net income, not including realized capital gains, each as
        reported in the prior year’s statutory annual statement. In addition, no dividend may
        be paid in excess of unassigned earned surplus. At December 31, 2007, Everest Re had $309.6
        million available for payment of dividends in 2008 without the need for prior regulatory
        approval.

Statutory Financial Information.

Everest
        Re prepares its statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices
        prescribed or permitted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
        (“NAIC”) and the Delaware Insurance Department. Prescribed statutory accounting
        practices are set forth in the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. The capital
        and statutory surplus of Everest Re was $2,886.6 million and $2,704.1 million at December

        CONTINGENCIES

In the
        ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other
        formal and informal dispute resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the
        Company’s rights and obligations under insurance, reinsurance and other contractual
        agreements. In some disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or
        to collect funds owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others
        to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. These disputes arise from time to time and are
        ultimately resolved through both informal and formal means, including negotiated
        resolution, arbitration and litigation. In all such matters, the Company believes that its
        positions are legally and commercially reasonable. While the final outcome of these matters
        cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that any of these matters,
        when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
        position or liquidity. However, an adverse resolution of one or more of these items in any
        one quarter or fiscal year could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
        results of operations in that period.

In 1993
        and prior, the Company had a business arrangement with The Prudential wherein, for a fee,
        the Company accepted settled claim payment obligations of certain property and casualty
        insurers, and, concurrently, became the owner of the annuity or assignee of the annuity
        proceeds funded by the property and casualty insurers specifically to fulfill these fully
        settled obligations. In these circumstances, the Company would be liable if The Prudential,
        which has an A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from A.M. Best Company (“A.M.
        Best”), were unable to make the annuity payments. The estimated cost to replace all
        such annuities for which the Company was contingently liable at December 31, 2007 and 2006
        was $150.4 million and $150.5 million, respectively.

Prior to
        its 1995 initial public offering, the Company purchased annuities from an unaffiliated life
        insurance company with an A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from A.M. Best to settle
        certain claim liabilities of the Company. Should the life insurance company become unable
        to make the annuity payments, the Company would be liable for those claim liabilities. The
        estimated cost to replace such annuities at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $21.7 million
        and $20.2 million, respectively.

        SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The
        Company has a 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (“2002 Employee Plan”), a 1995 Stock
        Incentive Plan (“1995 Employee Plan”), a 2003 Non-Employee Director Equity
        Compensation Plan (“2003 Director Plan”) and a 1995 Stock Option Plan for
        Non-Employee Directors (“1995 Director Plan”). In addition, the Company has
        awarded options to non-employee directors in Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999. On
        January 1, 2002 the Company implemented FAS 123 and related interpretations for these plans
        and Board actions and on January 1, 2006 the Company implemented FAS 123(R).

Under
        the 2002 Employee Plan, 4,000,000 common shares have been authorized to be granted as share
        options, share awards or restricted share awards to officers and key employees of the
        Company. At December 31, 2007, there were 1,788,800 remaining shares available to be
        granted under the 2002 Employee Plan. The 2002 Employee Plan replaced the 1995 Employee
        Plan; therefore, no further awards will be granted under the 1995 Employee Plan. Under the
        2003 Director Plan, 500,000 common shares have been authorized to be granted as share
        options or share awards to non-employee directors of the Company. At December 31, 2007
        there were 470,000 remaining shares available to be granted under the 2003 Director Plan.
        Under the 1995 Director Plan, a

F-39

total of
        50,000 common shares have been authorized to be granted as share options to non-employee
        directors of the Company. At December 31, 2007, there were 37,439 remaining shares
        available to be granted under the 1995 Director Plan.

Board
        actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999, which were not approved by shareholders, awarded options to
        non-employee directors. The Board actions were designed to award non-employee directors
        with the option to purchase common shares to increase their ownership interest in the
        Company of non-employee directors whose services are considered essential to the
        Company’s continued progress, to align such interests with those of the shareholders
        of the Company and to provide them with a further incentive to serve as directors to the
        Company. Under Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999; 40,000, 30,000 and 26,000 common
        shares were granted as share options to non-employee directors of the Company.

Options
        granted under the 2002 Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at the earlier of 20%
        per year over five years or upon the expiration of any applicable employment agreement,
        options granted under the 1995 Director Plan vest at 50% per year over two years and
        options granted under the 2003 Director Plan and the 2001, 2000 and 1999 Board actions vest
        at 33% per year over three years. All options are exercisable at fair market value of the
        stock at the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. Restricted shares
        granted under the 2002 Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at the earlier of 20%
        per year over five years or upon the expiration of any applicable employment agreement and
        restricted shares granted under the 2003 Director Plan vest at 33% per year over three
        years.

For
        share options granted, nonvested shares granted and shares issued under the 2002 Employee
        Plan, the 1995 Employee Plan, the 2003 Director Plan and the 1995 Director Plan,
        share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations
        and comprehensive income was $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The
        corresponding income tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and
        comprehensive income for share-based compensation was $3.8 million for the year ended
        December 31, 2007.

The fair
        value of each option award was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes
        option valuation model. The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value
        of the options for the periods indicated:

        (market price less exercise price) of options exercised during the years ended December 31,
        2007, 2006 and 2005 was $17.0 million, $20.5 million and $19.7 million, respectively. The
        cash received from the exercised share options for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
        $15.1 million. The tax benefit realized from the options exercised for the year ended
        December 31, 2007 was $5.9 million.

As of
        December 31, 2007, there was $9.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related
        to nonvested share-based compensation expense. That cost is expected to be recognized over
        a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the
        years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, was $4.2 million, $4.5 million and $1.8
        million, respectively. The tax benefit realized from the shares vested for the year ended
        December 31, 2007 was $0.7 million.

        1995 Director Plan, Group issued 1,991 common shares in 2007, 1,661 common shares in 2006
        and 1,962 common shares in 2005 to the Company’s non-employee directors as
        compensation for their service as directors in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These
        issuances had aggregate values of approximately $206,000, $157,000 and $180,000,
        respectively.

Since
        its 1995 initial public offering, the Company has issued to certain key employees of the
        Company 397,000 restricted common shares, of which 40,660 restricted shares have been
        cancelled. The Company has issued to non-employee directors of the Company 17,500

        million, $2.1 million and $1.0 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from employees
        who chose to pay required withholding taxes with shares exercised under the share option
        grants or restricted shares, which became

        acquired 328 common shares at a cost of $32,905 in 2005 from non-employee directors who
        chose to pay the option exercise price with shares.

19.
        RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

During
        the normal course of business, the Company, through its affiliates, engages in reinsurance
        and brokerage and commission business transactions with companies controlled by or
        affiliated with its outside directors. Such transactions, individually and in the
        aggregate, are not material to the Company’s financial condition, results of
        operations and cash flows.

20.
        SEGMENT REPORTING

The
        Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S.
        Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance
        operation writes property and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis,
        through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The
        U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general
        agents and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation
        writes accident and health (“A&H”), marine, aviation and surety business
        within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The
        International operation writes non-U.S. property and casualty reinsurance through Everest
        Re’s branches in Canada and Singapore and offices in Miami and New Jersey. The
        Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty
        markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies
        from its Bermuda office and reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through
        its UK branch.

These
        segments are managed in a coordinated fashion with respect to pricing, risk management,
        control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations.
        Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating
        segments based upon their underwriting results.

Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred,
        commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses. Underwriting results are
        measured using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting
        expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and
        other underwriting expenses by earned premium. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate
        reinsurance, although such reinsurance does not materially impact segment results, as
        business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first
        produced.

The
        Company does not maintain separate balance sheet data for its operating segments.
        Accordingly, the Company does not review and evaluate the financial results of its
        operating segments based upon balance sheet data.

        from and assets residing in the individual foreign countries in which the Company writes
        business are not identifiable in the Company’s financial records. Based on written
        premium, the largest country, other than the U.S., in which the Company writes business, is
        the United Kingdom, with $479.8 million of written premium for the year ended December 31,
        2007. No other country represented more than 5% of the Company’s revenues.

Approximately 14.7%, 17.2% and 17.8% of the Company’s gross written
        premiums in 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively, were sourced through the Company’s
        largest intermediary.
