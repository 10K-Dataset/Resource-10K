financial data in this document have been prepared using generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America. As used in this document,
“Group” means Everest Re Group, Ltd. (formerly Everest Reinsurance Group, Ltd.);
“Holdings” means Everest Reinsurance Holdings, Inc.; “Everest Re”

ITEM 1.

Business

The Company

Group, a Bermuda
company, was established in 1999 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. On February
24, 2000, a corporate restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding
company of Holdings, which remains the holding company for the Company’s U.S. based
operations. Holders of shares of common stock of Holdings automatically became holders of
the same number of common shares of Group. Prior to the restructuring, Group had no
significant assets or capitalization and had not engaged in any business or prior
activities other than in connection with the restructuring. The Company had gross written
premiums in 2004 of $4.7 billion and shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004 of
$3.7 billion.

In connection with the restructuring,
Group established a Bermuda-based reinsurance subsidiary, Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda),
Ltd. (“Bermuda Re”), which commenced business in the second half of 2000. Group
also formed Everest Global Services, Inc., a Delaware subsidiary, to perform
administrative and back-office functions for Group and its U.S. based and non-U.S. based
subsidiaries.

Holdings, a Delaware corporation, was
established in 1993 to serve as the parent holding company of Everest Re, a Delaware
property and casualty reinsurer formed in 1973. Until October 6, 1995, Holdings was an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“The
Prudential”). On October 6, 1995, The Prudential sold its entire interest in the
shares of common stock of Holdings in an initial public offering (the “IPO”).

The Company’s principal
business, conducted through its operating subsidiaries, is the underwriting of reinsurance
and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and international markets. The Company underwrites
reinsurance both through brokers and directly with ceding companies, giving it the
flexibility to pursue business regardless of the ceding company’s preferred
reinsurance purchasing method. The Company underwrites insurance principally through
general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers. Group’s operating
subsidiaries, excluding Mt. McKinley Insurance Company (“Mt. McKinley”), which
is in run-off, are each rated A+ (“Superior”) by A.M. Best Company (“A.M.
Best”), an independent insurance industry rating organization that rates insurance
companies on factors of concern to policyholders.

Following is a summary of the
Company’s principal operating subsidiaries:

o

Bermuda
Re, a Bermuda insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Group, is registered in
Bermuda as a Class 4 insurer and long-term insurer and is authorized to write property
and casualty business and life and annuity business. Bermuda Re commenced business in the
second half of 2000. On January 1, 2004 Bermuda Re purchased the UK branch of Everest Re.
Bermuda Re’s UK branch provides property and casualty reinsurance to the United Kingdom and
European markets.  Bermuda Re had shareholders’equity
at December 31, 2004 of $1.7 billion based on U.S. GAAP.


o

Everest
International Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Everest International”), a Bermuda
insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Group, is
registered in Bermuda as a Class 4 insurer and is authorized to write property and
casualty business. All of Everest International’s business during 2004, related to
quota share reinsurance of Everest Re and the UK branch of Bermuda Re. Everest
International had shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2004 of $142 million based on
U.S. GAAP.

o

Everest
Re, a Delaware insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Holdings, is a licensed
property and casualty insurer and/or reinsurer in all states (except Nevada and Wyoming),
the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and is authorized to conduct reinsurance
business in the United Kingdom (through July 12, 2004), Canada and Singapore. Everest Re
underwrites property and casualty reinsurance for insurance and reinsurance companies in
the U.S. and international markets. Everest Re had statutory surplus at December 31, 2004
of $2.1 billion.

o

Everest
National Insurance Company (“Everest National”), an Arizona insurance company
and a direct subsidiary of Everest Re, is licensed in 47 states and the District of
Columbia and is authorized to write property and casualty insurance in the jurisdictions
in which it is licensed. This is called writing insurance on an admitted basis. The
majority of Everest National’s business is reinsured by its parent, Everest Re.

o

Everest
Indemnity Insurance Company (“Everest Indemnity”), a Delaware insurance company
and a direct subsidiary of Everest Re, engages in the excess and surplus lines insurance
business in the U.S. Excess and surplus lines insurance is specialty property and
liability coverage that an insurer not licensed to write insurance in a particular
jurisdiction is permitted to provide to insureds when the specific specialty coverage is
unavailable from admitted insurers. This is called writing insurance on a non-admitted
basis. Everest Indemnity is licensed in Delaware and is eligible to write business on a
non-admitted basis in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The majority
of Everest Indemnity’s business is reinsured by its parent, Everest Re.

o

Everest
Security Insurance Company (“Everest Security”), formerly Southeastern Security
Insurance Company, a Georgia insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Everest Re, was
acquired in January 2000 and writes property and casualty insurance on an admitted basis
in Georgia and Alabama. The majority of Everest Security’s business is reinsured by
its parent, Everest Re.

o

Mt.
McKinley (f/k/a Gibraltar Casualty Company, “Gibraltar”), a Delaware insurance
company and a direct subsidiary of Holdings, was acquired by Holdings in September 2000
from The Prudential. Mt. McKinley was formed by Everest Re in 1978 to engage in the
excess and surplus lines insurance business in the U.S. In 1985, Mt. McKinley ceased
writing new and renewal insurance and now its ongoing operations relate to servicing
claims arising from its previously written business. Effective September 19, 2000, Mt.
McKinley and Bermuda Re entered into a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement,
whereby Mt. McKinley transferred, for what management believes to be arm’s-length
consideration, all of its net insurance exposures and reserves to Bermuda Re.

o

Everest
Re Holdings,  Ltd.  ("Everest Ltd."), a Bermuda company and a direct subsidiary of
Everest Re, was formed      in 1998 and owned Everest Re Ltd., a United  Kingdom  company
that was  dissolved  after its  reinsurance  operations      were  converted into branch
 operations of Everest Re.  Everest Ltd.  holds $79 million of investments  and cash, the
     management of which constitutes its principal operations.

Reinsurance Industry Overview

Reinsurance
is an arrangement in which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify
another insurance company, the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance
risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more insurance contracts.
Reinsurance can provide a ceding company with


several benefits, including a
reduction in net liability on individual risks or classes of risks, catastrophe
protection from large or multiple losses and assistance in maintaining acceptable
financial ratios. Reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting
capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be
possible without a concomitant increase in capital and surplus. Reinsurance, however,
does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to policyholders.

There are two basic types of
reinsurance arrangements: treaty and facultative reinsurance. In treaty reinsurance, the
ceding company is obligated to cede and the reinsurer is obligated to assume a specified
portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company. Treaty reinsurers do
not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties and,
consequently, after a review of the ceding company’s underwriting practices, are
largely dependent on the original risk underwriting decisions made by the ceding company.
In facultative reinsurance, the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part
of the risk under a single insurance contract. Facultative reinsurance is negotiated
separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance normally
is purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered by their reinsurance
treaties, for amounts in excess of the dollar limits of their reinsurance treaties or for
unusual risks.

Both treaty and facultative
reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis. Under
pro rata reinsurance, the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as
the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion. Under excess of loss reinsurance, the
reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and
expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount, known as the ceding company’s
retention or reinsurer’s attachment point, generally subject to a negotiated
reinsurance contract limit.

In pro rata reinsurance, the
reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission. The ceding commission
generally is based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the business being
reinsured (commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative
expense). Premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss
reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives
because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk. There is usually no ceding
commission on excess of loss reinsurance.

Reinsurers may purchase reinsurance
to cover their own risk exposure. Reinsurance of a reinsurer’s business is called a
retrocession. Reinsurance companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other
reinsurers, known as retrocessionaires, for reasons similar to those that cause insurers
to purchase reinsurance: to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks,
protect against catastrophic losses, stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional
underwriting capacity.

Reinsurance can be written through
intermediaries, generally professional reinsurance brokers, or directly with ceding
companies. From a ceding company’s perspective, both the broker and the direct
distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages. A ceding company’s decision
to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of
such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed.

Business Strategy

The Company’s underwriting
strategies seek to capitalize on its financial strength and capacity, its employee
expertise and its flexibility to offer multiple products through multiple distribution
channels. The Company’s strategies include effective management of the property and
casualty underwriting cycle, which refers to the tendency of insurance premiums, profits
and the demand for and availability of coverage to rise and fall over time. The Company
also seeks to manage its catastrophe exposures and retrocessional costs. Efforts to
control expenses and to operate in a cost-efficient manner are also a continuing focus for
the Company.


The Company’s products include:
(1) the full range of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance coverages, including
marine, aviation, surety, errors and omissions liability (“E&O”),
directors’ and officers’ liability (“D&O”), medical malpractice,
other specialty lines, accident and health (“A&H”), workers’
compensation and (2) reinsurance of life and annuity business. The Company’s product
distribution includes direct and broker reinsurance channels; U.S., Bermuda and
international markets; treaty and facultative reinsurance and admitted and non-admitted
insurance.

The Company’s underwriting
strategy emphasizes underwriting profitability rather than premium volume, writing
specialized property and casualty risks and integration of underwriting expertise across
all underwriting units. Key elements of this strategy are prudent risk selection,
appropriate pricing through strict underwriting discipline and continuous adjustment of
the Company’s business mix to respond to changing market conditions. The Company
focuses on reinsuring companies that effectively manage the underwriting cycle through
proper analysis and pricing of underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and
performance are compatible with its objectives.

The Company’s underwriting
strategy also emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions,
such as increased demand or favorable pricing trends. The Company believes that its
existing strengths, including its broad underwriting expertise, U.S., Bermuda and
international presence, strong financial ratings and substantial capital, facilitate
adjustments to its mix of business geographically, by line of business and by type of
coverage, allowing it to capitalize on those market opportunities that provide the
greatest potential for underwriting profitability. The Company’s insurance operations
complement these strategies by allowing the Company access to business that would not
likely be available to it on a reinsurance basis. The Company carefully monitors its mix
of business across all operations to avoid inappropriate concentrations of geographic or
other risk.

Marketing

The Company writes
business on a worldwide basis for many different customers and for many lines of
business, providing a broad array of coverages. The Company is not materially dependent
on any single customer, small group of customers, line of business or geographical area.
For the 2004 calendar year, no single customer (ceding company or insured) generated more
than 7.8% of the Company’s gross written premiums. The Company does not believe that
a reduction of business from any one customer would have a material adverse effect on its
future financial condition or results of operations due to the Company’s competitive
position in the marketplace and the continuing availability of other sources of business.

Approximately 60.0%, 13.1% and 26.9%
of the Company’s 2004 gross written premiums were written in the broker reinsurance,
direct reinsurance and insurance markets, respectively. The Company’s ability to
write reinsurance both through brokers and directly with ceding companies gives it the
flexibility to pursue business regardless of the ceding company’s preferred
reinsurance purchasing method.

The broker reinsurance market
consists of several substantial national and international brokers and a number of smaller
specialized brokers. Brokers do not have the authority to bind the Company with respect to
reinsurance agreements, nor does the Company commit in advance to accept any portion of a
broker’s submitted business. Reinsurance business from any ceding company, whether
new or renewal, is subject to acceptance by the Company. Brokerage fees are generally paid
by reinsurers. The Company’s ten largest brokers accounted for an aggregate of
approximately 45.1% of gross written premiums in 2004, with the two largest brokers
accounting for approximately 16.9% (Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.) and 8.3% (Aon
Risk Services) of gross written premiums, respectively. The Company does not believe that
a reduction of business assumed from any one broker would have a materially adverse effect
on the Company due to its competitive position in the market place, relationships with
ceding companies and the continuing availability of other sources of business.


The direct reinsurance market remains
an important distribution channel for reinsurance business written by the Company. Direct
placement of reinsurance enables the Company to access clients who prefer to place their
reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon the reinsurer’s in-depth
understanding of the ceding company’s needs.

The Company’s insurance business
is written principally through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers. In
2004, the Company’s largest agency relationship, American All-Risk Insurance
Services, LLC, accounted for approximately 7.8% of gross written premiums, which consists
of approximately 15,000 individual workers’ compensation policies. In June 2004, the
Company received notification of termination with respect to its contract with American
All-Risk Insurance Services, LLC. Under the terms of the contract, the agency continued to
produce business exclusively for the Company through October 15, 2004. The business
produced under this relationship will continue in force through the policy expiration
dates or cancellation. The Company does not believe that the termination of this contract
will have a material adverse effect on future Company operations.

The Company continually evaluates
each business relationship, including the underwriting expertise and experience brought to
bear through the involved distribution channel, performs analyses to evaluate financial
security, monitors performance and adjusts underwriting decisions accordingly.

Segment Information

The
Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S.
Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance
operation writes property and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative
basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the
U.S. The U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily
through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The
Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business
within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The
International operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re’s
branches in Canada and Singapore, in addition to foreign business written through Everest
Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and
insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers
through brokers and directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and property
and casualty reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK
branch.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, including with
respect to capital, investments and support operations. As a result, management monitors
and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their
underwriting gain (loss) or underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned
premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) incurred, commission
and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in
particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which,
respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting
expenses by earned premium. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance, but such
reinsurance generally does not impact segment results, as business is generally reported
within the segment in which the business was first produced. For selected financial
information regarding these segments, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re
sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re. Business for this branch was previously
included in the International segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to
the sale and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (“FAS
131”), the Company restated the International and Bermuda segments for the years
ended 2003 and 2002 to conform to December 31, 2004 segment reporting.


In 2003, Everest National, another
subsidiary of the Company, opened a regional office in California to better serve its
western U.S. Insurance business. The business produced through this additional office is
included in the U.S. Insurance operation.

Underwriting Operations

The following table presents the
distribution of the Company’s gross written premiums by its U.S. Reinsurance, U.S.
Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda operations for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000, classified according to whether the
premium is derived from property or casualty business and, for reinsurance business,
whether it represents pro rata or excess of loss business:



U.S. Reinsurance Operation.

The Company’s U.S. Reinsurance operation writes           property
and casualty reinsurance, both treaty and facultative, through           reinsurance
brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S.           The Company
targets certain brokers and, through the broker market, specialty           companies and
small to medium sized standard lines companies. On a direct basis,           the Company
targets companies that place their business predominantly in the           direct market,
including small to medium sized regional ceding companies, and           seeks to develop
long-term relationships with those companies. In addition, the           U.S. Reinsurance
operation writes portions of reinsurance programs for larger,           national
insurance companies.

In 2004, $452.1 million of gross
written premiums were attributable to U.S. treaty property business, of which 24.9% was
written on an excess of loss basis and 75.1% was written on a pro rata basis. The
Company’s property underwriters utilize sophisticated underwriting methods, which
management believes are necessary to analyze and price property business, particularly
that segment of the property market which has catastrophe exposure.

U.S. treaty
casualty business accounted for $792.6 million of gross written premiums           in
2004, of which 11.3% was written on an excess of loss basis and 88.7% was
          written on a pro rata basis. The treaty casualty portfolio consists of
          professional liability, D&O liability, workers’ compensation, excess
          and surplus lines and other liability coverages. As a result of the complex
          technical nature of most of these risks, the Company’s casualty
          underwriters tend to specialize by line of business and work closely with the
          Company’s pricing actuaries.

The Company’s facultative unit
conducts business both through brokers and directly with ceding companies, and consists of
four underwriting units representing property, casualty, specialty and national brokerage
lines of business. Business is written from a facultative headquarter office in New York
and satellite offices in Chicago and Oakland. In 2004, $64.3 million, $115.3 million,
$21.7 million and $32.1 million of gross written premiums were attributable to the
property, casualty, specialty and national brokerage lines of business, respectively.

In 2004, 83.0%, 10.4% and 6.6% of the
U.S. Reinsurance operation’s gross written premiums were written in the broker
reinsurance, direct reinsurance and insurance markets, respectively.

U.S. Insurance
Operation.

In 2004, the Company’s U.S. Insurance operation           wrote
$1,167.8 million of gross written premiums, of which 86.4% was casualty,
          predominantly workers’ compensation insurance, and 13.6% was property. Of
          the total business written, Everest National wrote $953.1 million and Everest
Re           wrote $10.6 million, with both principally targeting commercial property and
          casualty business written through general agency relationships with program
          administrators. Workers’ compensation business accounted for $686.4
          million, or 58.8% of the total business written, including $371.7 million, or
          54.2% of the total workers’ compensation business written as California
          workers’ compensation business and $481.4 million, or 41.2% of the total
          business written as non-workers’ compensation business. Everest Indemnity
          wrote $176.6 million, principally targeting excess and surplus lines insurance
          business written through surplus lines brokers. Everest Security wrote $27.5
          million, principally targeting non-standard auto business written through
retail           agency relationships. With respect to insurance written through general
agents           and surplus lines brokers, the Company supplements the initial
underwriting           process with periodic claims, underwriting and operational reviews
and ongoing           monitoring.

Specialty Underwriting
 Operation.

The
Company’s Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and
surety reinsurance. The A&H unit primarily focuses on health reinsurance of
traditional indemnity plans, self-insured health plans, accident coverages and specialty
medical plans. The marine and aviation unit focuses on ceding companies with a particular
expertise in marine and aviation business. The marine and aviation business is written
primarily through brokers and contains a significant international component written
primarily in the London market. Surety business underwritten by the Company consists
mainly of reinsurance of contract surety bonds.


Gross written premiums of the A&H
unit in 2004 totaled $281.9 million, of which 63.8% was written through the broker market
and 36.2% was written through the direct market.

Gross written premiums of the marine
and aviation unit in 2004 totaled $100.1 million, substantially all of which was written
on a treaty basis and sourced through reinsurance brokers. Marine treaties represented
53.1% of marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2004 and consisted mainly of hull
and liability coverage. Approximately 43.3% of the marine unit premiums in 2004 were
written on a pro rata basis and 56.7% as excess of loss. Aviation premiums accounted for
46.9% of marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2004 and included reinsurance for
airlines and general aviation. Approximately 72.6% of the aviation unit’s premiums in
2004 were written on a pro rata basis and 27.4% as excess of loss.

In 2004, gross written premiums of
the surety unit totaled $105.1 million. Approximately 93.9% of the surety unit premiums in
2004 were written on a pro rata basis and 6.1% on an excess of loss basis. Most of the
portfolio is reinsurance of contract surety bonds written directly with ceding companies,
with the remainder being credit reinsurance, mostly in international markets.

International Operation.

The
Company’s International operation aims to capitalize on the growth opportunities in
the international reinsurance markets. The Company targets several international markets,
including: Canada, with a branch in Toronto; Asia, with a branch in Singapore; and Latin
America, Africa and the Middle East, which business is serviced from Everest Re’s
Miami and New Jersey offices. The Company also writes “home-foreign” business,
which provides reinsurance on the international portfolios of U.S. insurers, from New
Jersey. Approximately 85.2% of the gross written premiums by the Company’s
international underwriters in 2004 represented property business, while 14.8% represented
casualty business. As with its U.S. operations, the Company’s International operation
focuses on financially sound companies that have strong management and underwriting
discipline and expertise. Approximately 66.1% of the Company’s international business
was written through brokers, with 33.9% written directly with ceding companies.

Gross written premiums of the
Company’s Canadian branch totaled $140.5 million in 2004 and consisted of pro rata
property (42.1%), excess property (24.4%), pro rata casualty (6.0%) and excess casualty
(27.5%). Approximately 72.2% of the Canadian premiums consisted of treaty reinsurance,
while 27.8% was facultative reinsurance.

The Company’s Singapore branch
covers the Asian markets and accounted for $112.1 million of gross written premiums in
2004. This business consisted of pro rata property (58.1%), excess property (37.0%), pro
rata casualty (4.2%) and excess casualty (0.7%).

International business written out of
Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices accounted for $435.1 million of gross
written premiums in 2004 and consisted of pro rata treaty property (69.7%), pro rata
treaty casualty (8.3%), excess treaty property (9.6%), excess treaty casualty (2.4%) and
excess facultative property and casualty (10.0%). Of this international business, 60.6%
was sourced from Latin America, 25.7% was sourced from the Middle East, 10.4% was sourced
from Africa and 3.3% was “home-foreign” business.

Bermuda Operation.

The
Company’s Bermuda operation writes property, casualty, life and annuity business
through Bermuda Re and property and casualty reinsurance through its UK branch. In 2004,
the Bermuda operation continued to scale up and had gross property and casualty written
premiums of $342.2 million accounting for virtually all of its business, of which $117.7
million or 34.4% was facultative reinsurance or individual risk insurance and $224.5
million or 65.6% was treaty reinsurance.

In 2004, the Company’s gross
written premiums by the UK branch of Bermuda Re totaled $541.2 million and consisted of pro rata
property (34.1%), excess property (22.0%), pro rata casualty (27.2%) and excess casualty
(16.7%). All of London’s gross written premiums related to treaty reinsurance.


Geographic Areas

The Company
conducts its business in Bermuda, the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. For select
financial information about geographic areas, see Note 18 of Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Risks attendant to the foreign operations of the Company parallel
those attendant to the U.S. operations of the Company, with the primary exception of
foreign exchange risks. For more information about the risks, see ITEM 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Safe
Harbor Disclosure”.

Underwriting Process

The
Company offers ceding companies full service capability, including actuarial, claims,
accounting and systems support, either directly or through the broker community. The
Company’s capacity for both property and casualty risks allows it to underwrite
entire contracts or major portions thereof that might otherwise need to be syndicated
among several reinsurers. The Company’s strategy is to act as “lead” reinsurer
in many of the reinsurance treaties it underwrites. The lead reinsurer on a treaty
generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in a stronger
position to negotiate price, terms and conditions than is a reinsurer that takes a
smaller position. Management believes this strategy enables it to more effectively
influence the terms and conditions of the treaties on which it participates. When the
Company does not lead the treaty, it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the
treaty. The Company may decline to participate in a treaty based upon its assessment of
all relevant factors.

The Company’s treaty
underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among the Company’s underwriters,
actuaries and claim staff. Treaties are reviewed for compliance with the Company’s
general underwriting standards and certain larger treaties are evaluated in part based
upon actuarial analyses by the Company. The actuarial models used in such analyses are
tailored in each case to the exposures and experience underlying the specific treaty and
the loss experience for the risks covered by such treaties. The Company does not
separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties. The Company
does, however, generally evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to
determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty. The Company, when appropriate,
also conducts underwriting, operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding
companies to ensure that the ceding companies operate within such guidelines. Underwriting
audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff, the selection and pricing of risks
and the capability of monitoring price levels over time. Claim audits, when appropriate,
are performed in order to evaluate the client’s claims handling abilities and
practices.

The Company’s facultative
underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks, limits and
maximum risk exposures. Specified classes of U.S. risks and large premium risks are
referred to Everest Re’s New York facultative headquarters for specific review before
premium quotations are given to clients. In addition, the Company’s guidelines
require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate
limits, complexity or volatility, regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract.
Non-U.S. risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within
the involved operations.

The Company’s insurance
operations principally write property and casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through
select program managers. These programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and
the program manager’s capabilities. The Company’s rates, forms and underwriting
guidelines are tailored to specific risk types. The Company’s underwriting,
actuarial, claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to
establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate
monitoring mechanisms.

Risk Management and Retrocession
Arrangements

The Company manages its risk of loss
through a combination of aggregate exposure limits, underwriting guidelines that take into
account risks, prices and coverage, and retrocessional arrangements.


The Company is exposed to multiple
insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a
hurricane or an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory.
Any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one, several or many of the
Company’s treaties or lines of business, including property and/or casualty
exposures. The Company employs various techniques, including licensed modeling software,
to assess its accumulated exposure. Such techniques are inherently more difficult to apply
to non-property exposures. Accumulated exposures with respect to catastrophe losses are
generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss (“PML”). The Company
defines PML as its anticipated maximum loss, taking into account contract limits, caused
by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused
by a hurricane or earthquake, of such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in
every 100 years.

Management believes that the
Company’s greatest catastrophe exposure world wide from any single event is to a U.S.
earthquake affecting the west coast including workers’ compensation exposure where
the Company estimates it has a pre-tax PML exposure of $427 million. The Company further
estimates that its second largest exposure relates to a hurricane affecting the U.S. east
coast with a pre-tax PML of $390 million. There can be no assurance that the Company will
not experience losses from one or more catastrophic events that exceed, perhaps by a
substantial amount, its estimated PML.

The U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act
of 2002 was signed into law in November 2002. This legislation provides Federal
reimbursement of 90% of insured losses, in excess of statutory retention levels, due to
acts of terrorism carried out by foreign powers on U.S. soil or against U.S. air carriers,
vessels or foreign missions. This coverage does not apply to reinsurance. Reinsurance
contracts generally exclude losses arising from terrorist events, except where such
coverage has been specifically included in the underwriting and pricing of the involved
reinsurance. As the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 is due to expire on December 31,
2005, the Company is generally excluding coverage for terrorism risks
effective January 1, 2006 on its insurance business, where such exclusions have
been approved by state regulators. These endorsements are conditional based on an
extension or modification of the legislation. The Company does not believe that this
legislation has had a significant impact on its operations.

Underwriting guidelines have been
established for each business unit. These guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of
business that can be written based on a variety of factors, including ceding company, line
of business, geographical location and risk hazards. In each case, those guidelines permit
limited exceptions, which must be authorized by the Company’s senior management.

The Company employs a retrocessional
approach under which the Company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business
written or exposure accumulations or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering
the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the
Company’s operations. All reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the
potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing, terms, conditions
and availability of such coverage, with the aim of securing cost-effective protection. The
level of reinsurance coverage varies over time, reflecting the underwriter’s and/or
Company’s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the
reinsurance markets.

The Company does not typically
purchase significant amounts of reinsurance to cover specific reinsurance business
written, but it does from time to time purchase retrocessional protections where
underwriting management deems it to be prudent and/or cost-effective to reinsure a
portion of the specific risks being assumed. The Company purchased an excess property
facultative retrocessional program in 2002 and 2001 as well as an excess workers’ compensation
retrocessional program in 2001. In addition, the Company purchased an excess property
catastrophe retrocessional program for losses incurred outside of the U.S. in 2002 and
2001. The 2002 program, which expired on June 5, 2003, was not renewed. The Company also
participates in “common account” retrocessional arrangements for certain
reinsurance treaties. Common account reinsurance arrangements are arrangements whereby
the ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and


its reinsurers on one or more of its
reinsurance treaties. Common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of
individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies, including the ceding
company, with respect to the involved treaties.

The Company typically considers the
purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the U.S. Insurance
operation. The type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk
exposures, individual program exposures, aggregate exposures by line of business, overall
segment exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance. Facultative
reinsurance will typically be considered for individual accounts with large exposure and
quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for individual programs of business.
In evaluating the purchase of reinsurance for a line of business, the Company generally
seeks to limit exposure to individual claim severity as opposed to frequency. For
workers’ compensation, the Company’s predominant business line at the time, the
Company purchased in 1998, for policies incepting during and after November 1998, a
workers’ compensation reinsurance program that provided for statutory limits coverage
in excess of $75,000 of losses per occurrence on the Company’s workers’
compensation insurance business written prior to November 1, 2000. Effective November
2000, this primary workers’ compensation reinsurance program provided statutory
limits coverage in excess of $250,000 of losses per occurrence for business written prior
to December 31, 2001. The Company has not purchased such coverage for the period
subsequent to December 31, 2001. The remaining net aggregate U.S Insurance segment
exposures, after purchasing facultative reinsurance, quota share program reinsurance
and/or aggregate line of business coverage, are considered in evaluating the purchase of
corporate level retrocessional protection.

The Company considers purchasing
corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of
exposures. Such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the
availability of cost-effective retrocessional protection. For years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss
retrocession coverage that provided up to $175 million of coverage for each year. These
excess of loss policies provided coverage if Everest Re’s consolidated statutory
basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment point for each year of
coverage. The attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included adjustable
premium provisions that effectively caused the Company to offset, on a pre-tax income
basis, up to approximately 57% of such ceded losses. The maximum recovery for each year
was $175 million before giving effect to the adjustable premium. As of December 31, 2004,
the Company has ceded the maximum limits under all three contracts. The Company did not
purchase similar coverage subsequent to December 31, 2001.

Although certain of the
Company’s catastrophe and aggregate excess of loss retrocessions have terms which
provide for additional premiums to be paid to the retrocessionaire in the event that
losses are ceded, all aspects of the Company’s retrocessional program have been
structured to permit these agreements to be accounted for as reinsurance under Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance
of Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts”.

If a single catastrophe were to occur
that resulted in $427 million of gross loss and LAE in 2005 (an amount equivalent to the
Company’s PML), management estimates that the effect on the Company’s income
would be approximately $427 million and $341 million before and after taxes, respectively.
There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience one or more catastrophic
events that could cause these estimates to be exceeded, perhaps by a substantial amount.

In connection with the Company’s
acquisition of Mt. McKinley in September 2000, the Company had coverage under an
aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by Prudential Property and
Casualty Insurance Company of Indiana (“Prupac”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
The Prudential. On October 31, 2003, LM Property & Casualty Insurance Company (“LM”)
completed its purchase of Prupac and its obligations from The Prudential. The Prudential
continues to guarantee LM’s obligation under this agreement. This agreement covers
80% or $160 million of the first $200 million of any adverse loss reserve development on
the carried


reserves of Mt. McKinley at the date
of acquisition and reimburses the Company as such losses are paid by the Company.
Cessions under this reinsurance agreement exhausted the limit available under the
contract at December 31, 2003.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company
carried as an asset $1,210.8 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses
ceded. Of this amount, $405.0 million, or 33.4%, was receivable from subsidiaries of
London Reinsurance Group (“London Life”), $160.0 million, or 13.2%, was
receivable from LM, $132.5 million, or 10.9%, was receivable from Transatlantic
Reinsurance Company (“Transatlantic”) and $100.0 million, or 8.3%, was
receivable from Continental Insurance Company (“Continental”). No other
retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s receivables. See ITEM 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Financial Condition”.

The Company’s arrangements with
both London Life and Continental are managed on a funds held basis, which means that the
Company has not released premium payments to the retrocessionaire, but rather retains such
payments to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire, records them as a liability,
credits interest on the balances and reduces the liability account as payments become due.
As of December 31, 2004, such funds had reduced the Company’s net exposure to London
Life to $184.1 million, effectively 100% of which has been secured by letters of credit,
and its exposure to Continental to $43.7 million. LM’s obligations are guaranteed by
The Prudential.

No assurance can be given that the
Company will seek or be able to obtain retrocessional coverage in the future similar to
that in place currently or in the past. The Company continuously evaluates its exposures
and risk capacities in the context of reinsurance market conditions, at both the specific
and corporate level. Although management carefully selects its reinsurers, the Company is
subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to
reinsurers does not relieve the Company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies.

Claims

Reinsurance claims are managed by the
Company’s professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial
loss reports and coverage issues, monitoring claims handling activities of ceding
companies, establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of
claims. In addition to claims assessment, processing and payment, the claims staff
selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim
procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies. Insurance claims, except those
relating to Mt. McKinley’s business, are generally handled by third party claims
services providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the
Company’s professional claims staff.

The Company intensively manages its
asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) exposures through dedicated, centrally
managed claim staffs for Mt. McKinley and Everest Re. Both are staffed with experienced
claim and legal professionals that specialize in the handling of such exposures. These
units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account, responding to claim
developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as
appropriate. Specific or general claim developments that may have material implications
for the Company are regularly communicated to senior management, actuarial, legal and
financial areas. Meetings among these areas, claim management and senior management are
held at least quarterly to review the Company’s overall reserve positions and make
changes, if appropriate. The Company continually reviews its internal processing,
communications and analytics, seeking to enhance the management of its A&E exposures,
in particular in the context of changes in the landscape of asbestos claims and
litigation.

Reserves for Unpaid Property and
Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Significant periods of time may elapse
between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the insurer and
the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the
insurer by the reinsurer. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and LAE, insurers
and reinsurers establish reserves,


which are balance sheet liabilities
representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and
related expenses on losses that have already occurred. Actual losses and LAE paid may
deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves. To the extent reserves prove to be
insufficient to cover actual losses and LAE after taking into account available
reinsurance coverage, the Company would have to augment such reserves and incur a charge
to earnings, which could be material in the period such augmentation takes place. See
ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Loss and LAE Reserves”.

While the reserving process is
difficult and subjective for insurance companies, the inherent uncertainties of estimating
such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer, due primarily to the longer time between
the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer, the
diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or
facultative contracts, the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information
regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies. In
addition, trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not
necessarily occur or affect liability development to the same degree in the future. As a
result, actual losses and LAE may deviate, perhaps substantially, from estimates of
reserves reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Like many other property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company has experienced adverse loss development
for prior accident years, which has led to adjustments in losses and LAE reserves. The
increase in net reserves for prior accident years reduced net income for the periods in
which the adjustments were made. There can be no assurance that adverse development from
prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have
a material adverse effect on net income.

Changes in Historical Reserves

The following table shows changes in
historical loss reserves for the Company for 1994 and subsequent years. The table is
presented on a GAAP basis except that the Company’s loss reserves for its Canadian
branch operations are presented in Canadian dollars, the impact of which is not material.
The top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and LAE recorded
at each year end date. Each amount in the top line represents the estimated amount of
future payments for losses and LAE on claims occurring in that year and in all prior
years. The upper (paid) portion of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid through
each subsequent year on those claims for which reserves were carried as of each specific
year end. The lower (liability re-estimated) portion shows the re-estimated amount of the
previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year.
The reserve estimates change as more information becomes known about the actual claims for
which the initial reserves were carried. The cumulative redundancy/deficiency line
represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established.
It is equal to the initial reserve less the latest liability re-estimated amount.

Each amount other than the original
reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts
for prior periods. For example, if a loss settled in 1997 for $100,000, was first reserved
in 1994 at $60,000 and remained unchanged until settlement, the $40,000 deficiency (actual
loss minus original estimate) would be included in the cumulative redundancy (deficiency)
in each of the years in the period 1994 through 1996 shown below. Conditions and trends
that have affected development of liability in the past are not indicative of future
developments. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or
deficiencies based on this table.



The most recent six years on the
above table reflect cumulative deficiencies, also referred to as adverse development, with
the largest indicated deficiency in 2001. Three active classes of business are the
principal contributors to those deficiencies: professional liability reinsurance, general
casualty reinsurance and workers’ compensation insurance. In addition to these active
business classes, there continues to be adverse experience on A&E reserves.

In the professional liability
reinsurance class, the late 1990s and early 2000s saw a proliferation of claims relating
to bankruptcies and other corporate, financial and/or management improprieties. This
resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims on the professional
liability policies reinsured by the Company. In the general casualty area, the Company
continues to experience claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the
Company’s pricing and reserving assumptions, particularly for accident years 1999 and
2000. These losses reflect unfavorable trends in litigation and economic variability. With
respect to both of these classes, another factor was the increasingly competitive
conditions in insurance and reinsurance markets during this period. While the Company
seeks to manage the impact of competitive condition changes on its results, it is
generally unable to divorce itself entirely from the underlying industry cycles of its
principal business. See ITEM 1, “Business – Competition”.

In the workers’ compensation
insurance class, the majority of which was written in California, the Company has
experienced adverse development primarily for accident years 2001 and 2002. As a result of
significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment, the
Company’s writings in this class were relatively more subject to variability than are
some of its more established and/or stable lines of business. Although cumulative results
through 2004 continue to be quite profitable for this book of business, there has been
some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years 2001 and
2002.

With respect to active business
classes, the Company actively manages the collection, auditing and analysis of loss data,
and factors the resulting information into both its reserving processes and its
prospective underwriting and pricing activities on as timely a basis as possible.

For years 1994 and prior, management
believes that two factors had the most significant impact on loss development. First,
through the 1980s, a number of industry and external factors, such as the propensity of
courts to award large damage awards in liability cases, combined to increase loss
frequency and severity to unexpectedly high levels. Second, contracts written prior to
1986 contained coverage terms which, for the Company and the industry in general, have
been interpreted by courts to provide coverage for A&E exposures not contemplated by
either the pricing or the initial reserving of the contracts. Legal developments during
the 1980s, and continuing to date, have necessitated additional reserving for such
exposures on both a case basis and an incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) basis.
These factors were the primary reasons for the cumulative adverse development on the 1994
and prior calendar year reserves. See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting
Policies – Asbestos and Environmental Exposures”.

The change between 1994 and 1995
reflects the impact of a stop loss reinsurance agreement with Mt. McKinley, which was then
a subsidiary of The Prudential. This stop loss agreement commenced in 1995 when The
Prudential sold the stock of the Company in an initial public offering and hence
recoveries under this coverage are attributed to the 1995 accident year. As a result of
this agreement, reserve development arising from claims incurred prior to July 1, 1995
(January 1, 1995 as respects catastrophe losses) was ceded under the agreement with no
impact on net development, except for a modest retention, when the adverse development
reflected for accident year 1994 and prior is considered in the context of the mitigating
favorable development attributed to the 1995 accident year. This coverage became an
inter-affiliate reinsurance transaction with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley in 2000,
which eliminated any subsequent impact on net reserve development. See ITEM 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Financial Condition”.


Management believes that adequate
provision has been made for the Company’s loss and LAE reserves. While there can be
no assurance that reserves for and losses from these claims will not increase in the
future, management believes that the Company’s existing reserves, reserving
methodologies and retrocessional arrangements lessen the probability that any such
increases would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. These statements regarding the Company’s loss
reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities
laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein. See
ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations – Safe Harbor Disclosure”.

The following table is derived from
the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table above and summarizes the effect of reserve
re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations by accident year for the
same ten year period ended December 31, 2004. Each column represents the amount of reserve
re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the
re-estimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far
right represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates for the indicated accident years.

The reserve development by accident
year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors discussed
above that caused the deficiencies shown in the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table.
Development in accident years 1994 and prior principally reflect the impact of the
liability award inflation and A&E exposures discussed above. The favorable
development experienced for the 1995 accident year is due to stop loss reinsurance
provided to the Company at the time of its initial public offering, which, when
established, was specifically intended to mitigate the impact of development on reserves
at June 30, 1995. The adverse development experienced in the 1998 through 2001 accident
years relates principally to casualty reinsurance, including professional liability
classes and workers’ compensation insurance where, in retrospect, the Company’s
initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of
unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures. The favorable development for
accident years 2002 and 2003 relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to
property reinsurance business.


The Company’s loss reserving
methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends,
seeking, on a timely basis, to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to
factor the impact of such shifts into its underwriting and pricing on a prospective
basis.

The following table presents a
reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve balances for the years indicated on a GAAP
basis:

Prior year incurred losses were
$312.0 million in 2004 and $256.9 million in 2003. Such losses were the result of the
reserve development noted above, as well as inherent uncertainty in establishing loss and
LAE reserves.

Reserves for Asbestos and
Environmental Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

The Company’s reserves include
an estimate of the Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims for which
ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. There are
significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses
from A&E claims. See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Asbestos and Environmental Exposures” and
Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mt. McKinley’s
book of direct A&E exposed insurance is relatively small and           homogenous.
The book is based principally on excess liability policies; thus the
          claim/legal staff does not have to analyze exposure under many different policy
          forms, but rather can focus on a limited number of policies and policy forms.
As           a result of this focused structure, the Company believes that it is able to
          comprehensively analyze its exposures, allowing it to identify and analyze
those           claims on which it has unusual exposure, such as policies in which it may
be           exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non-products
asbestos           claims, for concentrated ongoing attention.

The Company aims to be actively
engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to Mt.
McKinley. Such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement, negotiation,
litigation, or the monitoring of claim activity under Settlement in Place (“SIP”)
agreements. SIP agreements generally condition an insurer’s payment upon the actual
claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to
control the insurer’s payments. The Company’s Mt. McKinley operation is
currently managing nine SIP agreements, three of which were executed prior to the
acquisition of Mt. McKinley


in 2000. The Company’s
preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a
fixed schedule of payments, because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty.

The Company has significantly
enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time, as well as
its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active. Those
insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous, but
still active management, with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics, which may
indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity. The Company continually focuses on
further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential
exposure of policyholders, including those that may not have reported significant A&E
losses.

Everest Re’s book of assumed
reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of A&E exposed
relationships. Because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the Company has
been managing the A&E exposures for many years, its claim staff is familiar with the
ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are
therefore most likely to generate future liabilities. The Company’s claim staff has
developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies
and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies. This level of
familiarity enhances the quality of the Company’s analysis of its exposure through
those companies. As a result, the Company believes that it can identify those claims on
which it has unusual exposure, such as non-products asbestos claims, for concentrated
attention. However, in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities, the Company
relies on claims data supplied by its ceding companies and brokers. This information is
not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of ultimate loss
projections.

The following table summarizes the
composition of the Company’s total reserves for A&E losses, gross and net of
reinsurance, for the years ended December 31:

Additional losses, including those
relating to latent injuries and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type
or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the Company or the industry, may emerge
in the future. Such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the
Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Future Policy Benefit
Reserves

Future policy benefit liabilities for
annuities are reported at the accumulated fund balance of these contracts. Reserves for
those liabilities include both mortality and morbidity provisions with respect to life and
annuity claims, both reported and unreported. Actual experience in a particular period may
be worse than assumed experience and, consequently, may adversely affect the
Company’s operating results for the period. See Note 1F of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


Activity in the reserve for future
policy benefits is summarized as follows:

Investments

The Company’s
overall financial strength and results of operations are, in part, dependent on the
quality and performance of its investment portfolio. Net investment income and net
realized capital gains (losses) on the Company’s invested assets constituted 11.7%,
8.9%, and 11.8% of the Company’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company’s cash and invested assets totaled $11.5
billion at December 31, 2004, which consisted of 93.0% fixed maturities of which 95.5%
were investment grade, 5.6% equity securities and 1.4% other invested assets.

The Company’s current investment
strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income, through a high quality, diversified, taxable
bond and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of
liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted
continuously, consistent with the Company’s current and projected operating results,
market conditions and tax position. Additionally, the Company invests in equity
securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the
investment portfolio.

The board of directors of each of the
Company’s operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy
and guidelines and, together with senior management, for overseeing their execution. The
Company’s investment portfolio is in compliance with the insurance laws of the
jurisdictions in which its subsidiaries are regulated. Generally, an independent
investment advisor is utilized to manage the Company’s fixed income investment
portfolio within the established guidelines and is required to report activities on a
current basis and to meet with the Company periodically to review and discuss the
portfolio structure, securities selection and performance results. The Company manages
directly its investments in its equity and other invested asset portfolios.

The Company’s investment
guidelines include a general duration guideline of five to six years. The duration of an
investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of
interest and the possibility of early prepayment of such security. This investment
duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management, which considers
economic and business factors. An important factor considered by management is the
Company’s average duration of potential liabilities, which, at December 31, 2004, is
estimated at approximately 4.5 years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting
liabilities using standard duration calculations.

The duration of the fixed income
portfolio at December 31, 2004 was 5.2 years. The Company made a decision to shorten
duration during the second half of 2003 by purchasing interest only strips of
mortgaged-back securities (“interest only strips”). The interest only strips
give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an
underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are
guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash flow from these investments
is primarily dependent upon the average life of the underlying mortgage pool. Generally,
as market interest rates and more


specifically market mortgage rates
decline, mortgagees tend to refinance, which will decrease the average life of a mortgage
pool and decrease expected cash flows. Conversely, as market interest rates and more
specifically market mortgage rates rise, repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows
will tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to increase
as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These
movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the Company’s
other fixed income investments. As interest rates peaked during the second quarter of
2004 the Company liquidated its portfolio of interest only strips causing duration to
rise back to the present levels. Such investments contributed to the 4.2 year duration at
December 31, 2003.

For each currency in which the
Company has established substantial reserves, the Company seeks to maintain invested
assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately comparable to the estimated
liabilities. Approximately 8.5% of the Company’s consolidated reserves for losses and
LAE and unearned premiums represent estimated amounts payable in foreign currencies.

As of December 31, 2004, 93.0% of the
Company’s total investments and cash were comprised of fixed maturity investments or
cash and 95.5% of the Company’s fixed maturities consisted of investment grade
securities. The average maturity of fixed maturities was 8.1 years at December 31, 2004,
and their overall duration was 5.2 years. As of December 31, 2004, the Company did not
have any investments in commercial real estate or direct commercial mortgages or any
material holdings of derivative investments or securities of issuers that are experiencing
cash flow difficulty to an extent that the Company’s management believes could
threaten the issuer’s ability to meet debt service payments, except where other than
temporary impairments have been recognized.

As of December 31, 2004, the
Company’s common stock portfolio, which is comprised primarily of publicly traded
equity index funds, had a market value of $650.9 million, comprising 5.6% of total
investments and cash.

Ratings

The following table
shows the financial strength ratings of the Company’s operating subsidiaries as
reported by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“Standard &Poor’s”)
and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”). These ratings are
based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be considered an indication
of the degree or lack of risk involved in an equity investment in an insurance company.

A.M. Best
states that the “A+” (“Superior”) rating is assigned to
          those companies which, in its opinion, have a superior ability to meet their
          ongoing obligations to policyholders based on A.M. Best’s comprehensive
          quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company’s balance sheet
          strength, operating performance and business profile. The “A+"          (“Superior”)
rating is the second highest of fifteen ratings assigned           by A.M. Best, which
range from “A++” (“Superior”) to           “F” (“In
Liquidation”). Additionally, A.M. Best has five           classifications within the
“Not Rated” category. Standard &          Poor’s states that the “AA-” rating
is assigned to those           insurance companies which, in its opinion, have very
strong financial security           characteristics with respect to their ability to pay
under its insurance           policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. The
“AA-”          rating is the fourth highest of nineteen ratings assigned by
Standard &          Poor’s, which range from “AAA” to “R”.
Ratings from AA           to CCC may be modified by the use of a plus or minus sign to
show relative           standing of the insurer within those rating categories. Moody’s
states that           insurance companies rated “Aa” offer excellent financial
security.           Together with the Aaa rated companies, Aa rated companies constitute
what are           generally known as high-grade companies, with Aa rated companies
generally           having somewhat larger long-term risks. Moody’s rating
gradations are shown           through the use of nine distinct symbols, each symbol
representing a group of           ratings in which the financial security is broadly the
same. The “Aa3”          (Excellent) rating is the fourth highest of ratings
assigned by Moody’s,           which range from “Aaa” (Exceptional) to
“C” (Lowest).           Moody’s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to
each generic rating           classification from Aa through Caa. Numeric modifiers are
used to refer to the           ranking within a group – with 1 being the highest and
3 being the lowest.

Subsidiaries other than Everest Re
and Bermuda Re may not be rated by some or any rating agencies because such ratings are
not considered essential by the individual subsidiary’s customers or because of the
limited nature of the subsidiary’s operations. In particular, Mt. McKinley is not
rated because it is in run-off status.

The following table shows the debt
ratings by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s of the Holdings’
senior notes due March 15, 2005, March 15, 2010 and October 15, 2014 and Everest Re
Capital Trust (“Capital Trust”) and Everest Re Capital Trust II’s
(“Capital Trust II”) trust preferred securities due November 15, 2032 and March
29, 2034, all of which are considered investment grade. Debt ratings are a current
assessment of the credit worthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific obligation.

A debt rating of “a” or
“a-” is assigned by A.M. Best where the issuer, in A.M. Best’s opinion, has
a strong ability to meet the terms of the obligation. The “a” and “a-”
ratings are the sixth and seventh highest of 19 ratings assigned by A.M. Best, which range
from “aaa” to “ccc”. A debt rating of “A-” is assigned by
Standard & Poor’s where the obligor has a strong capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation, although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher
rated categories. Standard & Poor’s assigns a debt rating of “BBB” to
issues that exhibit adequate protection parameters although adverse economic conditions or
changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to
meet its financial commitment on the obligation. The “A-” and “BBB”
ratings from Standard & Poor’s are the seventh and ninth highest of 24 ratings
assigned by Standard & Poor’s, which range from “AAA” to “D”.
According to Moody’s, a debt rating of “A3” is assigned to issues that are
considered upper-medium-grade obligations and subject to low credit risk. Obligations
rated “Baa1” are subject to moderate credit risk and are considered medium-grade
and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics. The “A3” and
“Baa1” ratings are the seventh and eighth highest of 21 ratings assigned by
Moody’s, which range from “AAA” to “C”.

All of the above-mentioned ratings
are continually monitored and revised, if necessary, by each of the rating agencies.

The Company believes that its
ratings, in general, have become increasingly important to its operations because they
provide the Company’s customers and investors with an independent assessment of the
Company’s underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative
comparisons.

Competition

The worldwide
reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive yet cyclical by product and
market. Competition with respect to the types of reinsurance and insurance business in
which the Company is engaged is based on many factors, including the perceived overall
financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by
A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor’s, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions
where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and
coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and
insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and
experience in lines written. These factors operate at the individual market participant
level to varying degrees as applicable to the specific participant’s circumstances.
They also operate in aggregate across the reinsurance industry more generally
contributing, in combination with background economic conditions and variations in the
reinsurance buying practices of insurance companies, by participant and in the aggregate,
to cyclical movements in reinsurance rates, terms and conditions and ultimately
reinsurance industry aggregate financial results.

The Company competes in the U.S.,
Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous international
and domestic reinsurance and insurance companies. The Company’s competitors include
independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established
worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and
domestic and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at
Lloyd’s. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the Company
and have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the
industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the potential for
securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provides an
additional source of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition.

In 2004, the favorable market
conditions, which had developed during 2000 through 2003, generally began to weaken.
There were signs that pricing for most property classes declined modestly and that
pricing for most casualty classes softened. Competition increased, in part due to the
relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers over 2002 and 2003 and the attendant
buildup of capital in these participants. However, this profitability and capital buildup
varied significantly by market participant, reflecting the fact that the industry


generally still remained exposed to
fundamental issues that had negatively impacted its aggregate capacity in 2002 and 2003,
including weak investment market conditions and adverse loss emergence. Both of these had
tended to depress the industry’s aggregate financial performance and perceptions of
financial strength of industry participants over this period albeit with significant
variation by individual market participant. The industry experienced a record level of
catastrophe losses during 2004, particularly in the second half of the year, and it
remains unclear whether the aggregate catastrophe losses experienced by the industry will
reverse, stop or even moderate the trends toward market softening, particularly as
respects property classes.

Through 2003, reinsurance and
insurance markets had generally continued to firm, reflecting the continuing, although
diminishing, implications of losses arising from the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001, and more broadly, the impact of aggregate company reactions to broad and growing
recognition that competition in the late 1990s reached extremes in many classes and
markets, which ultimately led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms, conditions and
coverages. The effect of these extremes, which became apparent through excessive loss
emergence, varied widely by company depending on product offerings, markets accessed,
underwriting and operating practices, competitive strategies and business volumes. Across
all market participants, however, the aggregate general effect was depressed financial
results and erosion of the industry capital base. Coupled with deteriorating investment
market conditions and results, and renewed concerns regarding longer-term industry
specific issues, including legacy reserve issues and sub-par capital returns, these
financial impacts introduced substantial, and in some cases extreme, pressure for the
initiation and/or strengthening of corrective action by individual market participants.
These pressures, aggregating across industry participants, reinforced the trend
established in 2000 through 2003 toward firming prices, more restrictive terms and
conditions, tightened coverage availability across most classes and markets and increasing
concern with respect to the financial security of insurance and reinsurance providers,
impacts which set the stage for the 2004 trends discussed above.

The Company has been somewhat
disappointed by industry developments in 2004, which have generally operated to modestly
weaken pricing. The Company can not predict with any reasonable certainty whether and to
what extent these trends or conditions will persist and in particular whether the property
catastrophe losses experienced by the industry in 2004 will lessen competitive pressures,
particularly for the property classes of business. Notwithstanding these catastrophe
losses, the continued growth of reinsurance capacity, particularly in Bermuda, changes in
the Lloyd’s market, and the potential reemergence of a market share orientation among
some industry participants, combined with improving and in some cases strong financial
results, continues to contribute to uncertainty about the prospective level of competitive
pressures.

Employees

As of March 1,
2005, the Company employed 606 persons. Management believes that its employee relations
are good. None of the Company’s employees are subject to collective bargaining
agreements, and the Company is not aware of any current efforts to implement such
agreements.

Regulatory Matters

The Company
and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of
the various jurisdictions in which they conduct business, including essentially all
states of the U.S., Canada, Singapore, the United Kingdom and Bermuda. These regulations
vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect ceding
insurance companies and policyholders by regulating the Company’s conduct of
business, financial integrity and ability to meet its obligations relating to its
business transactions and operations. Many of these regulations require reporting of
information designed to allow insurance regulators to closely monitor the Company’s
performance.

Insurance Holding Company
Regulation.

Under applicable U.S. laws and regulations, no person, corporation or
other entity may acquire a controlling interest in the Company, unless such person,
corporation or entity has obtained the prior approval for such acquisition from the
Insurance Commissioners of Delaware and the other states in which the Company’s
insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled, currently Arizona,


California and Georgia. Under these
laws, “control” is presumed when any person acquires, directly or indirectly,
10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company. To obtain the approval of
any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file an application with the relevant
insurance commissioner disclosing, among other things, the background of the acquirer and
that of its directors and officers, the acquirer’s financial condition and its
proposed changes in the management and operations of the insurance company. U.S. state
regulators also require prior notice or regulatory approval of material inter-affiliate
transactions within the holding company structure. See “Dividends”.

The Insurance Companies Act of Canada
also requires prior approval by the Minister of Finance of anyone acquiring a significant
interest in an insurance company authorized to do business in Canada. In addition, the
Company is subject to regulation by the insurance regulators of other states and foreign
jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business. Certain of these states and
foreign jurisdictions impose regulations regulating the ability of any person to acquire
control of an insurance company authorized to do business in that jurisdiction without
appropriate regulatory approval similar to those described above.

Dividends.

Under
Bermuda law, Group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend           if such
payment would reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount           less than
the aggregate value of its liabilities and its issued share capital           and share
premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts. Group’s ability to           pay
dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends           from
its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries is           limited
under Bermuda law as well as the laws of the various U.S. states in           which Group’s
insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or           deemed domiciled. The
limitations are generally based upon net income and           compliance with applicable
policyholders’ surplus or minimum solvency           margin and liquidity ratio
requirements as determined in accordance with the           relevant statutory accounting
practices. As Holdings has outstanding debt           obligations, it is dependent upon
dividends and other permissible payments from           its operating subsidiaries to
enable it to meet its debt and operating expense           obligations and to pay
dividends to Group.

Under Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is
unable to declare or make payment of a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum solvency
margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is also unable to
declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless, after payment of the
dividend, the value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as certified by its
approved actuary, exceeds its liabilities for long-term business by at least the $250,000
minimum solvency margin. Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority is required if
Bermuda Re’s dividend payments would reduce its prior year end total statutory
capital by 15.0% or more. At December 31, 2004, Bermuda Re and Everest International met
their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant margin.

The payment of dividends to Holdings
by Everest Re is subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law. Generally, Everest Re may
only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus, which was $1,368.4 million at
December 31, 2004, and only after it has given 10 days prior notice to the Delaware
Insurance Commissioner. During this 10-day period, the Commissioner may, by order, limit
or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the Commissioner finds the insurer to be
presently or potentially in financial distress. Further, the maximum amount of dividends
that may be paid without the prior approval of the Delaware Insurance Commissioner in any
twelve month period is the greater of (1) 10% of an insurer’s statutory surplus as of
the end of the prior calendar year or (2) the insurer’s statutory net income, not
including realized capital gains, for the prior calendar year. Under this definition, the
maximum amount that will be available for the payment of dividends by Everest Re in 2005
without triggering the requirement for prior approval of regulatory authorities in
connection with a dividend is $209.3 million.

Insurance Regulation.

Neither

Bermuda
Re nor Everest International are admitted to do business in any jurisdiction in the U.S.
Both conduct their insurance business from their offices in Bermuda, and in the case of
Bermuda Re, its branch in the UK. In Bermuda, Bermuda Re and Everest International are
regulated by the


Insurance Act 1978 (as amended) and
related regulations (the “Act”). The Act establishes solvency and liquidity
standards and auditing and reporting requirements and subjects Bermuda Re and Everest
International to the supervision, investigation and intervention powers of the Bermuda
Monetary Authority. Under the Act, Bermuda Re and Everest International, as Class 4
insurers, are each required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda, to maintain a
minimum of $100 million in statutory capital and surplus, to have an independent auditor
approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority conduct an annual audit and report on their
respective statutory financial statements and filings and to have an appointed loss
reserve specialist (also approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority) review and report on
their respective loss reserves annually.

Bermuda Re is also registered under
the Act as a long-term insurer and is thereby authorized to write life and annuity
business. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is required to maintain $250,000 in statutory
capital separate from its Class 4 minimum statutory capital and surplus, to maintain a
long-term business fund, to separately account for this business and to have an approved
actuary prepare a certificate concerning its long-term business assets and liabilities to
be filed annually.

U.S. domestic property and casualty
insurers, including reinsurers, are subject to           regulation by their state of
domicile and by those states in which they are           licensed. The regulation of
reinsurers is typically related to the           reinsurer’s financial condition,
investments, management and operation. The           rates and policy terms of
reinsurance agreements are generally not subject to           direct regulation by any
governmental authority.

The operations of Everest Re’s
foreign branch offices in Canada, and Singapore are subject to regulation by the insurance
regulatory officials of those jurisdictions. Management believes that the Company is in
material compliance with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business and
operations. Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re sold its United Kingdom branch to
Bermuda Re, a Bermuda insurance company and direct subsidiary of Group. Business for this
branch was previously included in the International segment and is now included in the
Bermuda segment. Through this transaction, Bermuda Re’s operations in the United
Kingdom and worldwide are subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority (the
“FSA”). The FSA imposes solvency, capital adequacy, audit, financial reporting
and other regulatory requirements on insurers transacting business in the United Kingdom.
Bermuda Re presently meets or exceeds all of the FSA’s solvency and capital
requirements.

Everest Indemnity, Everest National,
Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to regulations similar to the U.S.
regulations applicable to Everest Re. In addition, Everest National and Everest Security
must comply with substantial regulatory requirements in each state where they conduct
business. These additional requirements include, but are not limited to, rate and policy
form requirements, requirements with regard to licensing, agent appointments,
participation in residual markets and claim handling procedures. These regulations are
primarily designed for the protection of policyholders.

Licenses.

Everest
Re is a licensed property and casualty insurer and/or reinsurer in           all states
(except Nevada and Wyoming), the District of Columbia and Puerto           Rico. In New
Hampshire and Puerto Rico, Everest Re is licensed for reinsurance           only. Such
licensing enables U.S. domestic ceding company clients to take credit           for
reinsurance ceded to Everest Re.

Everest Re is licensed as a property
and casualty reinsurer in Canada. It is also authorized to conduct reinsurance business
in Singapore. Everest Re can also write reinsurance in other foreign countries. Because
some jurisdictions require a reinsurer to register in order to be an acceptable market
for local insurers, Everest Re is registered as a foreign insurer and/or reinsurer in the
following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and the Philippines. Everest National is
licensed in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Everest Indemnity is licensed in
Delaware and is eligible to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in 49 states, the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Everest Security is licensed in Georgia and
Alabama. Mt. McKinley is licensed in Delaware and California.


Bermuda Re and Everest International
are registered as Class 4 insurers in Bermuda. Bermuda Re is also registered as a
long-term insurer in Bermuda.

Periodic Examinations.

Everest
Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity, Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to
periodic financial examination (usually every 3 years) of their affairs by the insurance
departments of the states in which they are licensed, authorized or accredited. Everest
Re’s, Everest Security’s, Everest Indemnity’s and Mt. McKinley’s last
examination reports were as of December 31, 2000, while Everest National’s last
examination was as of December 31, 2001. None of these reports contained any material
findings or recommendations. In addition, U.S. insurance companies are subject to
examinations by the various state insurance departments where they are licensed concerning
compliance with applicable conduct of business regulations.

NAIC Risk-Based Capital
Requirements.

The U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(“NAIC”) employs a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a
property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in
light of its size and risk profile. The major categories of a company’s risk profile
are its asset risk, credit risk, and underwriting risk. The standards are an effort by the
NAIC to prevent insolvencies, to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance
companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments.

Under the approved formula, a
company’s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital (“RBC”).
If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no action is necessary. Below this threshold
are four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees
of authority over a domestic insurer as the ratio of surplus to RBC decreases. The mildest
intervention requires the Company to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions. The
most severe action requires the Company to be rehabilitated or liquidated.

Based on their financial positions at
December 31, 2004, Everest Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity and Everest Security
exceed the minimum thresholds. Since Mt. McKinley ceased writing new and renewal insurance
in 1985, its domiciliary regulator, Delaware, has exempted Mt. McKinley from complying
with RBC requirements. Various proposals to change the RBC formula arise from time to
time. The Company is unable to predict whether any such proposal will be adopted, the form
in which any such proposals would be adopted or the effect, if any, the adoption of any
such proposal or change in the RBC calculations would have on the Company.

Tax Matters.

The following
summary of the taxation of the Company is based on current law. There can be no assurance
that legislative, judicial, or administrative changes will not be enacted that materially
affect this summary.

Bermuda.

Under
current Bermuda law, no income, withholding or capital gains taxes are           imposed
upon Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries. Group and its Bermuda           subsidiaries
have received an undertaking from the Minister of Finance in           Bermuda that, in
the event of any taxes being imposed, Group and its Bermuda           subsidiaries will
be exempt from taxation in Bermuda until March 2016.           Non-Bermuda branches of
Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the           jurisdictions in which
they operate.

Barbados.

Through
December 31, 2004, Group, maintained its principal office in           Barbados and was
registered as an external company under the Companies Act, Cap.           308 of Barbados
and was licensed as an international business company under the           Barbados
International Business Companies Act, 1991-24. As a result, Group was           subject
to a preferred rate of corporation tax on profits and gains in Barbados           and was
exempt from withholding tax on dividends, interest, royalties,           management fees,
fees or other income paid or deemed paid to a person who is not           resident in
Barbados or who, if so resident, carried on an international           business. No tax
was imposed on capital gains. Effective January 1, 2005,           Group’s principal
office was relocated to Bermuda.


United States.

Group’s
U.S. subsidiaries conduct business in and are subject to taxation in the U.S. Non-U.S.
branches of U.S. subsidiaries are subject to local taxation in the jurisdictions in which
they operate. Should the U.S. subsidiaries distribute current or accumulated earnings and
profits in the form of dividends or otherwise to Group, the Company would be subject to
withholding taxes. Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries believe that they have operated and
will continue to operate their businesses in a manner that will not cause them to generate
income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the
U.S. On this basis, Group does not expect that it and its Bermuda subsidiaries will be
required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes other than withholding taxes on certain
investment income and premium excise taxes. If Group or its Bermuda subsidiaries were
subject to U.S. income tax; there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

United Kingdom.

Bermuda
Re’s UK branch conducts business in the UK and is subject to taxation in the UK.
Bermuda Re’s Bermuda operations believe that they have operated and will continue to
operate in a manner which will not cause them to be subject to UK taxation. If Bermuda
Re’s Bermuda operations were subject to UK income tax there could be a material
adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash
flow.

ITEM 2.

Properties

Everest Re’s corporate offices
are located in approximately 115,000 square feet of leased office space in Liberty Corner,
New Jersey. Bermuda Re’s corporate offices are located in approximately 3,600 total
square feet of leased office space in Hamilton, Bermuda. The Company’s other twelve
locations occupy a total of approximately 76,400 square feet, all of which are leased.
Management believes that the above-described office space is adequate for its current and
anticipated needs.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

The Company does not believe that
there are any material pending legal proceedings to which it or any of its subsidiaries is
a party or of which any of their properties are subject.

In the ordinary course of business,
the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute
resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the Company’s rights and
obligations under insurance, reinsurance and other contractual agreements. In some
disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds
owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others to collect
funds or enforce alleged rights. Such disputes are resolved through formal and informal
means, including litigation and arbitration.

In all such matters, the Company
believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. The Company also
regularly evaluates those positions and, where appropriate, establishes or adjusts
insurance reserves to reflect its evaluation. The Company’s aggregate reserves take
into account the possibility that the Company may not ultimately prevail in each and
every disputed matter. The Company believes its aggregate reserves reduce the potential
that an adverse resolution of one or more of these matters, at any point in time, would
have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of
operations. However, there


can be no assurance that adverse
resolutions of such matters in any one period or in the aggregate will not result in a
material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

The number of record holders of common shares as of March 1, 2005 was 79. That number
excludes the beneficial owners of shares held in “street” name or held through
participants in depositories, such as The Depository Trust Company.

Dividend History and Restrictions

In 1995, the Board of Directors of the Company established a policy of declaring regular
quarterly cash dividends and has paid a regular quarterly dividend in each quarter since
the fourth quarter of 1995. The Company declared and paid its regular quarterly cash
dividend of $0.10 per share for each quarter of 2004 and $0.09 per share for each quarter
of 2003. A committee of the Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of
$0.11 per share, payable on or before March 25, 2005 to shareholders of record on March
7, 2005.

The declaration and payment of
future dividends, if any, by the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of
Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company’s earnings,
financial condition, business needs and growth objectives, capital and surplus
requirements of its operating subsidiaries, regulatory restrictions, rating agency
considerations and other factors. As an insurance holding company, the Company is
partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to
pay cash dividends to its stockholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and
to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment
of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re will be subject to


Bermuda insurance regulatory
restrictions. See “Regulatory Matters – Dividends” and Note 14A of Notes

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATION

Unless otherwise indicated, all
financial data in this document have been prepared using generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America. As used in this document,
“Group” means Everest Re Group, Ltd. (formerly Everest Reinsurance Group, Ltd.);
“Holdings” means Everest Reinsurance Holdings, Inc.; “Everest Re”
means Everest Reinsurance Company and its subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise
requires); and the “Company” means Everest Re Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries,
except when referring to periods prior to February 24, 2000, when it means Holdings and
its subsidiaries.

The following is a discussion of the
results of operations and financial condition of the Company. This discussion and analysis
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data”.

RESTRUCTURING

On February 24, 2000, a corporate
restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding company of Holdings,
which remains the holding company for Group’s U.S. operations. Effective January 1,
2005 the principal executive offices of Group were relocated from Barbados to Bermuda.

INDUSTRY CONDITIONS

The worldwide reinsurance and
insurance businesses are highly competitive yet cyclical by product and market.
Competition with respect to the types of reinsurance and insurance business in which the
Company is engaged is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial
strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best
and/or Standard & Poor’s, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the
reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered,
premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business
offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines
written. These factors operate at the individual market participant level to varying
degrees as applicable to the specific participant’s circumstances. They also operate
in aggregate across the reinsurance industry more generally contributing, in combination
with background, economic conditions and variations in the reinsurance buying practices of
insurance companies, by participant and in the aggregate, to cyclical movements in
reinsurance rates, terms and conditions and ultimately reinsurance industry aggregate
financial results.

The Company competes in the U.S.,
Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous international
and domestic reinsurance and insurance companies. The Company’s competitors include
independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established
worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and
domestic and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at
Lloyd’s. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the Company
and have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the
industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the potential for
securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provides an
additional source of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition.

In 2004, the favorable market
conditions, which had developed during 2000 through 2003, generally began to weaken.
There were signs that pricing for most property classes declined modestly and that
pricing for most casualty classes softened. Competition increased, in part due to the
relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers over 2002 and 2003 and the attendant
buildup of capital in these participants. However, this profitability and capital buildup
varied significantly by market participant, reflecting the fact that the industry
generally still remained exposed to fundamental issues that had negatively impacted its
aggregate capacity in 2002 and 2003, including weak investment market conditions and
adverse loss emergence. Both of these had tended to depress the industry’s aggregate
financial performance and perceptions of financial strength of


industry participants over this
period albeit with significant variation by individual market participant. The industry
experienced a record level of catastrophe losses during 2004, particularly in the second
half of the year, and it remains unclear whether the aggregate catastrophe losses
experienced by the industry will reverse, stop or even moderate the trends toward market
softening, particularly as respects property classes.

Through 2003, reinsurance and
insurance markets had generally continued to firm, reflecting the continuing, although
diminishing, implications of losses arising from the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001, and more broadly, the impact of aggregate company reactions to broad and growing
recognition that competition in the late 1990s reached extremes in many classes and
markets, which ultimately led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms, conditions and
coverages. The effect of these extremes, which became apparent through excessive loss
emergence, varied widely by company depending on product offerings, markets accessed,
underwriting and operating practices, competitive strategies and business volumes. Across
all market participants, however, the aggregate general effect was depressed financial
results and erosion of the industry capital base. Coupled with deteriorating investment
market conditions and results, and renewed concerns regarding longer-term industry
specific issues, including asbestos exposure and sub-par capital returns, these financial
impacts introduced substantial, and in some cases extreme, pressure for the initiation
and/or strengthening of corrective action by individual market participants. These
pressures, aggregating across industry participants, reinforced the trend established in
2000 through 2003 toward firming prices, more restrictive terms and conditions, tightened
coverage availability across most classes and markets and increasing concern with respect
to the financial security of insurance and reinsurance providers, impacts which set the
stage for the 2004 trends discussed above.

The Company has been somewhat
disappointed by industry developments in 2004, which have generally operated to modestly
weaken pricing. The Company can not predict with any reasonable certainty whether and to
what extent these trends or conditions will persist and in particular whether the property
catastrophe losses experienced by the industry in 2004 will lessen competitive pressures,
particularly for the property classes of business. Notwithstanding these catastrophe
losses, the continued growth of reinsurance capacity, particularly in Bermuda, changes in
the Lloyd’s market, and the potential reemergence of a market share orientation among
some industry participants, combined with improving and in some cases strong financial
results, continue to contribute to uncertainty about the prospective level of competitive
pressures.


FINANCIAL SUMMARY

The Company’s management
monitors and evaluates overall Company performance based upon financial results. The
following table displays a summary of the consolidated net income for the periods
indicated:

As indicated in the preceding
“Industry Conditions” section, the reinsurance and insurance industry generally
experienced favorable market conditions from 2001 through 2003. These favorable market
conditions, coupled with the Company’s financial strength, strategic positioning and
market and underwriting expertise, enabled the Company to increase its volume of business
significantly over this period. With the change in competitive trend throughout 2004 and
with little clarity regarding the impact of property catastrophe losses on prospective
market conditions, the Company continued to adapt its operations to slow its rate of
growth and even decrease writings for some classes of business and reemphasize its focus
on profitability as opposed to volume.

Gross written premiums were $4.7
billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 2.8% as compared with $4.6
billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, which had increased 60.7% compared with the
year ended December 31, 2002. Gross written premiums were $2.8 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2002, an increase of 51.8% compared with the year ended December 31, 2001.

Due to the nature of its businesses,
the Company is unable to precisely differentiate between the effects of price changes as
compared to the effects of changes in exposure. Similarly, because individual reinsurance
arrangements often reflect revised coverages, structuring, pricing, terms and/or
conditions from period to period, the Company is unable to differentiate between the
premium volumes attributable to new business as compared to renewal business. Management
believes, however, that on balance, the Company’s growth has been reasonably
balanced between growth in exposures underwritten and increased pricing and/or improved
terms and conditions. Management believes further that market conditions, although
changing, remain generally more


favorable for casualty business
classes than for property business classes; however, management notes that it continues
to see business opportunities in most product classes and markets. Although premium
volumes on a year to date basis have increased, the Company continues to decline business
that does not meet its objectives regarding underwriting profitability, a discipline
which became more apparent over the second half of 2004 with quarterly volumes for the
third and fourth quarters which reflected year over year declines in gross premiums
written.

In June 2004, the Company received
notification of termination with respect to its contract with American All-Risk Insurance
Services, LLC, its single largest producer of California workers’ compensation
insurance.  In 2004, American All–Risk Insurance Services, LLC accounted for approximately
7.8% of total gross written premiums.  Under the terms of the contract, the agency continued
to produce business
exclusively for the Company through October 15, 2004. The business produced under this
relationship will continue in force through the policy expiration dates or cancellation.
The Company does not believe that the termination of this contract will have a material
adverse effect on future Company operations and believes the termination was not entirely
inconsistent with its plan to moderate its writings in this market.

Net written premiums, comprised of
gross written premiums less ceded premiums, were $4.5 billion for the year ended December
31, 2004, an increase of 5.0% compared with $4.3 billion for the year ended December 31,
2003, which had increased 63.6% compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. Net
written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $2.6 billion, an increase of
69.1% compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. The increases in net written premium
are in line with the increases in gross written premium, as ceded written premium over the
period was relatively stable at $172.6 million, $258.4 million and $208.9 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Ceded premiums relate
primarily to specific reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and, to a
lesser extent, adjustment premiums in 2003 and 2002 on loss cessions made to the
Company’s corporate level aggregate reinsurance coverages.

Premiums earned were $4.4 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 18.4% compared with $3.7 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2003, which had increased 64.4% compared with the year ended
December 31, 2002. Premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $2.3 billion,
an increase of 54.9% compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. These increases
reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix together with
normal variability in earning patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company
shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets,
but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in
coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted with
coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring contracts.
Changes in estimates related to unreported reinsurance activity also contribute.

Incurred losses and LAE for the year
ended December 31, 2004 were $3.3 billion, an increase of 26.6% compared with $2.6 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2003, which had increased 59.6% compared with the year
ended December 31, 2002. Incurred losses and LAE for the year ended December 31, 2002 were
$1.6 billion, an increase of 34.7% compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. The
major contributing factor for the increases in 2004 was the increase in incurred losses
and LAE due to property catastrophe net event losses of $403 million, arising principally
from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, Edmonton hailstorms
and the Asian tsunami. Other factors, including the level of incurred losses and LAE
related to changes in volume as measured by earned premium, changes in rates, and terms
and the effect of changes in prior period loss reserve estimates, also contributed. The
increase in incurred losses and LAE relating to net adverse prior period reserve
strengthening of $312.0 million, $256.9 million and $140.1 million for years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, principally related to the Company’s
asbestos exposures, treaty casualty and workers’ compensation, partially offset in
2004 by a $33.4 million reduction in


reserves related to the World Trade Center events.
See ITEM 1, “Business — Changes in Historical Reserves” for additional
details and explanation.

Commission, brokerage and tax expense
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $975.2 million, $863.9 million
and $551.8 million, respectively, increasing principally as a result of premium volume
changes, as these expenses generally vary in direct proportion to premiums earned.
However, the percentage increase in expenses was somewhat less than the change in
premiums, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in the Company’s business mix.

Net investment income was $495.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 23.2% compared with $402.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which had increased 14.8% compared with the
year ended December 31, 2002. Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2002
was $350.7 million, an increase of 3.0% compared with the year ended December 31, 2001.
The year ended December 31, 2004 included a $32.7 million increase arising from an
atypical increase in the value of one of the Company’s limited partnership
investments. Excluding this increase, the net investment income increase generally
reflected growth in the Company’s cash and invested assets. Premiums are generally
collected over the first 12 to 15 months of the Company’s reinsurance and insurance
contract, while related losses are typically paid out over numerous years. This tends to
increase cash flow from operations when premiums are increasing. The Company’s cash
flow from operations was $1,487.6 million, $1,653.8 million and $742.7 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flow from operations was
impacted in particular by increased loss payments relating to catastrophe losses and
asbestos claim settlements in 2004. Coupled with common stock offerings and the issuance
of junior subordinated debt securities, this contributed to the growth in the
Company’s total investments and cash to $11,530.2 million.

Net realized capital gains of $89.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2004 were primarily the result of gains on the
sale of the Company’s interest only strips investment portfolio. Net realized capital
losses of $38.0 million and $50.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, were primarily the result of valuation adjustments on the interest only
strip portfolio in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 99-20, “Recognition
of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchases and Beneficial Interests in Securitized
Financial Assets” (“EITF 99-20”) and write-downs in the value of securities
deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, partially offset by realized
gains.

The Company’s income tax expense
is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding net income in the
jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with the impact from tax preferenced
investment income. Variations between years generally reflect changes in the relative
levels of pre-tax income between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Additionally, in
conjunction with the transfer of the Company’s UK Branch to Bermuda Re, there were
various tax issues giving rise to incremental net tax expenses in 2004. The Company
incurred income tax expenses of $64.9 million, $65.2 million and $30.7 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The slight decrease in tax
expense primarily reflected the impact of the catastrophe losses on 2004 underwriting
results, which were partially offset by additional taxable net investment income, taxable
realized capital gains and the expense associated with the transfer of the UK branch.

Net income for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $494.9 million, $426.0 million and $231.3 million,
respectively, generally reflecting improving underwriting and investment results and
realized capital gains in 2004, partially offset by realized capital losses in 2003 and
2002 and, particularly in 2004, catastrophe and asbestos losses, all moderated by the
impact of income taxes.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S.
Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance
operation writes property and casualty


reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative
basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the
U.S. The U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily
through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The
Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine,
aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly
with ceding companies. The International operation writes property and casualty
reinsurance through Everest Re’s branches in Canada and Singapore, in addition to
foreign business written through Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices. The
Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty
markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding
companies from its Bermuda office and property and casualty reinsurance to the United
Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, including with
respect to capital, investments and support operations. As a result, management generally
monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon
their underwriting gain (loss) or underwriting results. Underwriting results include
earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other
underwriting expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in particular loss, commission and
brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively divide incurred
losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by earned premium. The
Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance but such reinsurance generally does not
impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in which the
business was first produced. For selected financial information regarding these segments,
see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re
sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re. Business for this branch was previously
included in the International segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to
the sale and in accordance with FAS 131, the Company restated the International and
Bermuda segments for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 to conform to December 31,
2004 segment reporting.

In 2003, Everest National, another
subsidiary of the Company, opened a regional office in California to better serve its
western U.S. insurance business. The business produced through this additional office is
included in the U.S. Insurance operation.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004
COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003

Premiums.

Gross written premiums increased 2.8% to $4,704.1 million in 2004 from
          $4,573.8 million in 2003, as the Company took advantage of selected growth
          opportunities, while continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach.
          Premium growth areas included a 32.0% ($166.9 million) increase in the
          International operations, primarily due to a $97.7 million increase in
          international business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices,
          representing primarily Latin American business, and a $67.2 million increase in
          Asian business. The Bermuda operation grew 21.3% ($155.2 million) reflecting an
          emphasis on traditional business classes in Bermuda and the UK. The U.S.
          Insurance operation grew 9.2% ($98.3 million), principally as a result of a
          $193.8 million increase in program business other than workers’
          compensation, partially offset by a $95.5 million decrease in workers’
          compensation business. The Specialty Underwriting operation decreased 3.1%
          ($15.8 million), resulting primarily from a $70.4 million decrease in A&H
          business, partially offset by an increase in surety business of $29.6 million
          and an increase in marine and aviation business of $25.0 million. The U.S.
          Reinsurance operation decreased 15.6% ($274.1 million), principally relating to
          an $142.5 million decrease in treaty casualty business, a $74.9 million decrease
          in facultative business, a $32.6 million decrease in treaty property business
          and a $19.8 million decrease in treaty non-property business.

Ceded premiums decreased to $172.6
million in 2004 from $258.4 million in 2003, principally resulting from the inclusion in
2003 of $49.6 million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the 2000
accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the Company’s corporate
retrocessional programs, compared with no such adjustment premiums in 2004. Aside from
the corporate retrocessional programs, ceded premiums


generally relate to specific
reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and fluctuate based upon the level
of premiums written in the applicable programs.

Net written premiums increased by
5.0% to $4,531.5 million in 2004 from $4,315.4 million in 2003, reflecting the increase in
gross written premiums, combined with the decrease in ceded premiums.

Premium Revenues.

Net premiums
earned increased by 18.4% to $4,425.1 million in 2004 from $3,737.9 million in 2003.
Contributing to this increase was a 60.6% ($339.1 million) increase in the Bermuda
operation, a 42.0% ($194.1 million) increase in the International operation, a 13.8%
($114.0 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 3.5% ($49.7 million)
increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, partially offset by a 2.1% ($9.6 million)
decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. All of these changes reflect period to
period changes in net written premiums and business mix, together with normal variability
in earnings patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis
between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets, but also as
individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in coverage,
structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted with coverages,
structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring contracts. As premium
reporting, earnings, loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of
individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual contracts, arising from both
strategic shifts and day to day underwriting, can and does introduce appreciable
background variability in various underwriting line items. Changes in estimates related to
unreported reinsurance activity also contribute.

Expenses.

Incurred
loss and LAE increased by 26.6% to $3,291.1 million in 2004 from           $2,600.2
million in 2003. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was           principally
attributable to the provision for estimated catastrophe losses from           hurricanes
Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, the Asian           tsunami and
reserve adjustments for prior period losses, together with the           mitigating
effects of the increase in net premiums earned and the impact of           favorable
changes in the Company’s underlying business mix and aggregate           rates,
terms and conditions.

The Company’s loss and LAE
reserves reflect estimates of ultimate claim liability. Such estimates are reevaluated on
an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into
consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim
experience. The effect of such reevaluations impacts incurred losses for the current
period. The Company notes that its analytical methods and processes operate at multiple
levels, including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of
business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the aggregate. The
complexities of the Company’s business and operations require analyses and
adjustments, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. Additionally, the
attribution of reserves, changes in reserves and incurred losses between accident year and
underwriting year requires adjustments and allocations, both qualitative and quantitative,
at these various levels. All of these processes, methods and practices appropriately
balance actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended
to assure the accuracy, precision and consistency of the Company’s reserving
practices, which are fundamental to the Company’s operation. The Company notes,
however, that the underlying reserves remain estimates, which are subject to variation,
and that the relative degree of variability is generally least when reserves are
considered in the aggregate and generally increases as the focus shifts to more granular
data levels.

Incurred losses and LAE in 2004
reflected ceded losses and LAE of $141.0 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2003
of $278.4 million. The decrease in ceded losses is primarily the result of the absence in
2004 of cessions under the corporate level aggregate reinsurance covers. The ceded losses
and LAE in 2003 included $85.0 million of losses ceded under the 2000 accident year
aggregate excess of loss component of the Company’s corporate retrocessional program
and $81.1 million under the LM/Mt. McKinley reinsurance agreement.


Incurred losses and LAE include
catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable
and adverse development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance. Individual
catastrophe losses are reported net of specific reinsurance, but before recoveries under
corporate level reinsurance and potential IBNR reserve offsets. The Company defines a
catastrophe as a property event with expected reported losses of at least $5.0 million
before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific
cessions, were $403.0 million in 2004, relating principally to aggregate estimated losses
of $428.8 million from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons,
Edmonton hailstorms and the Asian tsunami, which were partially offset by $33.4 million of
reserve reductions related to the World Trade Center events. Catastrophe losses, net of
contract specific cessions, were $36.8 million in 2003, relating principally to the May
2003 tornado and hailstorm events and hurricanes Fabian and Isabel.

Net adverse prior period reserve
adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $312.0 million compared to $256.9
million in 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the adverse reserve adjustments included net adverse A&E adjustments
of $159.4 million and net adverse non-A&E adjustments of approximately $186.0 million
relating primarily to casualty reinsurance, partially offset by favorable development of
$33.4 million relating to the reduction of reserves for the World Trade Center events. For
the year ended December 31, 2003, net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for A&E
exposures were $50.2 million and net adverse non-A&E adjustments were $206.7 million,
which were net of a cession of $85 million under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess
of loss component of the Company’s corporate retrocessional program. It is important
to note that adverse non-A&E accident year reserve development arises from the
reevaluation of accident year results and that such reevaluations also impact premiums and
commissions attributed by accident year, generally mitigating, in part, the impact of loss
development and that such impacts are recorded as part of the overall reserve evaluation.

The U.S. Reinsurance segment
accounted for $77.7 million of net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for the year
ended December 31, 2004, which included $34.2 million of favorable development due to the
reserve reduction related to the catastrophe losses from the World Trade Center events, as
compared to net adverse prior period reserve adjustments of $150.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. Asbestos exposures accounted for $10.3 million and $16.8 million
of adverse reserve adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, with the remainder principally attributable to professional liability and
casualty business classes. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, there had been a
proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other financial management
improprieties. This increased number of claims, combined with larger claims, has
significantly increased incurred losses on the professional liability policies. In the
general casualty area, the Company continues to experience losses greater than historical
trends for accident years 1998 through 2001. These losses are being driven by adverse
trends in litigation and economic variability. In both the professional liability and
general casualty reinsurance areas, the Company relies upon loss reports from ceding
companies. Although the Company may record reserves at higher levels than those reported
by ceding companies, actual reported results have exceeded the initial loss indications.

The U.S. Insurance segment reflected
$43.3 million and $58.7 million of net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The adverse prior period reserve
adjustments were principally due to accident years 2000 through 2002, where the Company
strengthened its


reserves for California workers’ compensation insurance. This was a
relatively new book of business and was written in a challenging political
and economic environment. While management believes the cumulative results through 2004
remain quite positive, there has been some deterioration in claim frequency and severity
related to accident years 2001 and 2002.

The Specialty Underwriting segment
had $5.1 million of net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended
December 31, 2004, principally related to net adverse prior period reserve adjustments in
the surety and A&H business lines partially offset by favorable development from
marine and aviation. The net favorable prior period reserve
adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $23.9 million, primarily related to A&H business.

The International segment had $4.4
million of favorable net prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31,
2004 and net adverse prior period reserve adjustments of $15.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The favorable development in 2004 related primarily to 2003 Canadian
property catastrophe, international and Asia business. The prior period reserve
development for 2003 related primarily to general casualty business written in the U.S.
and Canada on both a quota share and excess basis for accident years 1996 through 2002.

The Bermuda segment reflected $190.3
million of net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31,
2004 and $55.4 million of net adverse prior reserve adjustments for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The development in the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the
result of $149.1 million of A&E reserve development. For the year ended December 31,
2003, reserve adjustments included $33.5 million related to A&E exposures. All of the
development related to asbestos exposures that were assumed through the September 19, 2000
loss portfolio transfer from Mt. McKinley in 2000.

Aggregate reserve development related
to A&E exposures was $159.4 million and $50.2 million for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written
by the Company prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley
acquisition in September 2000. The reserve strengthening on business written by the
Company, net of reinsurance, was $10.3 million and the net strengthening on the acquired
business was $149.1 million in 2004. Substantially all of the Company’s A&E
exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods prior to
1986. Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management is
unable to establish a meaningful range for these obligations.

In all cases, the prior period
development, sometimes referred to as reserve strengthening, reflects management’s
judgment as to the implications of losses and claim information reported during the period
on the Company’s reserve balances.

The segment components of the
increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2004 from 2003 were a 99.4% ($370.3 million)
increase in the Bermuda operation, a 56.6% ($151.4 million) increase in the International
operation, a 10.3% ($109.5 million) increase in the U.S Reinsurance operation, an 8.8%
($53.2 million) increase in the U.S.


Insurance operation and a 2.2% ($6.6 million)
increase in the Specialty Underwriting operation. These changes reflect variability in premiums
earned and changes in the loss expectation assumptions for business written, as well as
the net prior period reserve development and catastrophe losses discussed above. Incurred
losses and LAE for each operation were also impacted by generally improved pricing of the
underlying business, as well as variability relating to changes in the mix of business by
class and type, which in general reflected a more favorable mix.

The Company’s loss ratio, which
is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net premiums earned, increased by 4.8
percentage points to 74.4% in 2004 from 69.6% in 2003, reflecting the impact of the
changes in premiums earned and incurred losses and LAE discussed above, as well as
favorable changes in the underlying business mix and aggregate rates, terms and
conditions.

The following table shows the loss
ratios for each of the Company’s operating segments for 2004 and 2003. The loss
ratios for all operations were impacted by the factors noted above.

Segment underwriting expenses
increased by 12.9% to $1,075.8 million in 2004 from $952.6 million in 2003. Commission,
brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $111.2 million, principally reflecting increases in
premium volume and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses
increased by $11.9 million as the Company continues to expand operations to support its
increased business volume. Contributing to the segment underwriting expense increases were
a 47.5% ($62.8 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, a 40.4% ($49.6 million)
increase in the International operation and a 6.6% ($24.7 million) increase in the U.S.
Reinsurance operation, which were all partially offset by a 5.5% ($10.1 million) decrease
in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 2.7% ($3.7 million) decrease in the Specialty
Underwriting operation. The changes for each operation’s expenses principally
resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium volume and
business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of specific
reinsurance, as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business. The
Company’s expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net
premiums earned, was 24.4% in 2004 compared to 25.6% in 2003.

Investments.

Net
investment income increased 23.2% to $495.9 million in 2004 from $402.6           million
in 2003, principally reflecting the effects of investing $1,487.6           million of
cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31,           2004, as
well as $320.0 of net proceeds from the issuance of junior subordinated           debt
securities in March 2004 and $250.0 of net proceeds from the issuance of           senior
notes in October 2004. The increase also reflected $32.7 million           representing
an atypical increase in the carrying value of a limited partnership           investment.

The Company, because of its historical
income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of income yield
and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a measure of
performance than its overall income yield. With changes the Company perceives in overall
investment market conditions, and more specifically the acquisition of $496.5 million of
equity securities into the overall investment portfolio in 2004, the Company is
reweighting its view of total return. The following table provides a comparison of the
Company’s total return by asset class to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for
2004 and 2003.

Net realized capital gains were
$89.6 million in 2004, which reflected realized capital gains on the Company’s
investments of $164.3 million, including $118.2 million on the sale of interest only
strip investments, partially offset by $74.7 million of realized capital losses, which
included $65.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest only strips
deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with EITF 99-20,
prior to liquidation of the interest only strip portfolio during the second quarter of
2004. Net realized capital losses of $38.0 million in 2003 reflected realized capital losses on the Company’s
investments of $88.7 million, which included $25.7 million relating to write-downs in the
value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis and $46.2
million related to the impairment on interest only strips,


partially offset by $50.7 million of realized capital gains,
which included $16.8 million of realized capital gains on sales of the interest only
strips.

The Company has one credit default
swap, which it no longer writes, and five specialized equity put options in its product
portfolio. These products meet the definition of a derivative under Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“FAS 133”). Net derivative expense from these derivative
transactions in 2004 was $2.7 million and net derivative income from these derivative
transactions in 2003 was $5.9 million, with both periods principally reflecting changes in
fair value for the specialized equity put options. See also Note 2 of Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other income in 2004 was $0.7 million
compared to other expense of $1.0 million in 2003. The decrease in net expense for 2004
was primarily due to variability in the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by
other miscellaneous expenses.

Corporate underwriting expenses not
allocated to segments increased to $6.5 million for 2004 compared with $6.0 million for
2003 as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support increased business volume.

Interest expense in 2004 was $75.5
million compared to $57.3 million in 2003. Interest expense in 2004 included $42.0 million
relating to the senior notes, $32.4 million relating to the junior subordinated debt
securities and $1.2 million relating to borrowings under the Company’s revolving
credit facility. Interest expense in 2003 reflected $38.9 million relating to the issuance
of the senior notes, $17.0 million relating to the junior subordinated debt securities and
$1.4 million relating to borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility.
The increase in interest expense was due to the additional issuance of $320 million of
junior subordinated debt securities in March 2004 and the issuance of $250 million of
senior notes in October 2004.

Income Taxes.

The
Company’s income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and
corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with the
impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations between years generally reflect
changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income between jurisdictions with different tax
rates. Additionally, in conjunction with the transfer of the Company’s UK Branch to
Bermuda Re, there were various tax issues giving rise to net tax expenses. The Company
recognized income tax expense of $64.9 million in 2004 compared to $65.2 million in

.

Net Income.

Net income was
$494.9 million in 2004 compared to net income of $426.0 million in 2003, reflecting
improved investment income and realized capital gains, partially offset by reduced
underwriting profitability due to catastrophe losses.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003
COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002

Premiums.

Gross
written premiums increased 60.7% to $4,573.8 million in 2003 from           $2,846.5
million in 2002, as the Company took advantage of the general firming           of rates,
terms and conditions and selected growth opportunities, while           continuing to
maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. Premium growth areas           included a
95.9% ($857.7 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation,           principally
related to a $519.4 million increase in treaty casualty business, a           $253.9
million increase in treaty property business and a $62.8 million increase           in
facultative business. The International operation increased 42.9% ($156.3
          million), primarily due to a $79.6 million increase in international business
          written through the Miami and New Jersey offices representing primarily Latin
          American business and a $67.4 million increase to Canadian business. The U.S.
          Insurance operation grew 30.2% ($248.1 million), principally as a result of an
          $89.5 million increase in workers’ compensation and a $73.2 million
          increase in excess and surplus lines insurance. The Bermuda operation increased
          $450.8 million, reflecting a $256.9 million increase in premiums from the UK
          branch, and a shift toward more traditional business resulting from the rollout
          of treaty, facultative and individual risk capabilities in Bermuda. The
          Specialty Underwriting operation increased 2.9% ($14.3 million), resulting
          primarily from a $38.0 million increase in A&H business and a $19.0 million
          decrease in marine and aviation.


Ceded premiums increased to $258.4
million in           2003 from $208.9 million in 2002, principally reflecting growth in
specific           reinsurance of the Company’s primary insurance business, which
increased           from $116.1 million to $146.4 million. In addition, ceded premiums
for 2003           included $49.6 million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made
under the           2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the Company’s
          corporate retrocessional programs, while ceded premiums for 2002 included $5.1
          million and $49.4 million in adjustment premium relating to claims made under
          the 2001 and 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss elements of the
          Company’s corporate retrocessional programs, respectively.

Net written premiums increased by
63.6% to $4,315.4 million in 2003 from $2,637.6 million in 2002, reflecting the increase
in gross written premiums, combined with the growth in ceded premiums.

Premium Revenues.

Net premiums
earned increased by 64.4% to $3,737.9 million in 2003 from $2,273.7 million in 2002.
Contributing to this increase was a 96.0% ($697.5 million) increase in the U.S.
Reinsurance operation, a 45.1% ($143.4 million) increase in the International operation, a
43.7% ($250.5 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation, a $363.8 million increase
in the Bermuda operation and a 1.9% ($9.0 million) increase in the Specialty Underwriting
operation. All of these changes reflect period to period changes in net written premiums
and business mix together with normal variability in earnings patterns. Business mix
changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business,
distribution channels and markets but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew,
almost always with changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new
contracts are accepted with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from
those of expiring contracts. As premium reporting and earnings and loss and commission
characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts, the continuous
turnover of individual contracts, arising from both strategic shifts and day to day
underwriting, can and does introduce appreciable background variability in various
underwriting line items.

Expenses.

Incurred
loss and LAE increased by 59.6% to $2,600.2 million in 2003 from           $1,629.4
million in 2002. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was           principally
attributable to the increase in net premiums earned, the impact of           changes in
the Company’s mix of business and reserve adjustments for prior           period
losses.

Incurred losses and LAE in 2003
reflected ceded losses and LAE of $278.4 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2002
of $287.7 million. The ceded losses and LAE in 2003 included $85.0 million of losses ceded
under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company’s
corporate retrocessional program and $81.1 million under the LM/Mt. McKinley reinsurance
agreement. The ceded losses and LAE in 2002 included $11.0 million and $90.0 million of
losses ceded under the 2001 and 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of
the Company’s corporate retrocessional program, respectively, and $56.7 million under
the LM/Mt. McKinley reinsurance agreement.


Incurred losses and LAE include
catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable
and adverse development on prior period events, and are net of reinsurance. A catastrophe
is an event that causes a pre-tax loss on property exposures of at least $5.0 million
before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. Catastrophe losses, net of contract
specific cessions, were $36.8 million in 2003, relating principally to the May 2003
tornado and hailstorm events and hurricanes Fabian and Isabel, compared to $30.2 million
in 2002.

Net adverse prior period reserve
adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $256.9 million, which were net of a
cession of $85 million under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of
the Company’s corporate retrocessional program. For the year ended December 31, 2002,
net adverse prior period reserve adjustments were $140.1 million, which were net of
cessions of $11 million and $90 million under the 2001 and 2000 accident year aggregate
excess of loss component of the Company’s corporate retrocessional program,
respectively.

The U.S. Reinsurance segment
accounted for $134.2 million and $96.7 million of the non-A&E net prior period reserve
adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The two
principal underwriting areas responsible for these deficiencies are professional liability
and general casualty. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, there had been a
proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other financial management
improprieties. This increased number of claims combined with larger claims has
significantly increased incurred losses on the professional liability policies. In the
general casualty area, the Company continues to experience losses greater than historical
trends for accident years 1998 through 2003. These losses are being driven by adverse
trends in litigation and economic variability. In both the professional liability and
general casualty reinsurance areas, the Company relies upon loss reports from ceding
companies. Although the Company generally records reserves at higher levels than those
reported by ceding companies, actual reported results have exceeded the initial loss
indications. The reserve adjustments in these areas were partially offset by favorable
reserve development relating to property reinsurance for the 2002 accident year.

The U.S. Insurance segment reflected
$58.7 million and $14.0 million of net prior period reserve adjustments for years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, principally due to California workers’
compensation insurance. This was a relatively new book of business and was written in a
challenging political and economic environment. While management believes the cumulative
results through 2003 remain positive, there has been some deterioration in claim frequency
and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002.

The Specialty Underwriting segment
had favorable net prior period reserve adjustments of $23.9 million and $0.4 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The favorable adjustments for
2003, related primarily to A&H business and cessions under the corporate
retrocessional program and related principally to the 2000 through 2002 accident years.


The International segment had an
unfavorable net prior period reserve adjustment of $15.8 million and a favorable net
prior period reserve adjustment of $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. These reserve adjustments relate primarily to general casualty
business written in the U.S. and Canada on both a quota share and excess basis for
accident years 1996 through 2002, with the larger development on the 1998 through 2000
years.

The Bermuda segment reflected $21.9
million of unfavorable non-A&E net prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended
December 31, 2003 and $11.7 million of development for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Reserve development related to A&E exposures
were $50.2 million and $23.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written by the Company
prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley acquisition in
September 2000. The reserve strengthening on business written by the Company, net of
reinsurance, was $16.7 million in the U.S. Reinsurance segment and the net strengthening
on the acquired business was $33.5 million in the Bermuda segment in 2004. Substantially all of
the Company’s A&E exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with
coverage periods prior to 1986.

In all cases, the prior period
development reflects management’s judgment as to the implications of losses and claim
information reported during the period on the Company’s reserve balances.

The segment components of the
increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2003 from 2002 were a 97.6% ($523.1 million)
increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, an 45.1% ($83.2 million) increase in the
International operation, a 39.9% ($172.7 million) increase in the U.S Insurance operation
and a $209.7 million increase in the Bermuda operation, partially offset by a 5.7% ($18.0
million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. These changes generally reflect
increases in premiums earned, changes in the current year loss expectation assumptions for
business written, generally reflecting continued improvement in market conditions and
pricing, an increase in catastrophe losses and the net prior period reserve development
discussed above. Incurred losses and LAE for each operation were also impacted by
variability relating to changes in the level of premium volume and the mix of business by
class and type.

The Company’s loss ratio, which
is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net premiums earned, decreased by 2.1
percentage points to 69.6% in 2003 from 71.7% in 2002, reflecting the premiums earned and
incurred losses and LAE discussed above, as well as the general firming of rates, terms
and conditions and changes in business mix.


The following table shows the loss
ratios for each of the Company’s operating segments for 2003 and 2002. The loss
ratios for all operations were impacted by the expense factors noted above.

Segment underwriting expenses
increased by 54.0% to $952.6 million in 2003 from $618.5 million in 2002. Commission,
brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $312.2 million, principally reflecting increases in
premium volume and changes in the mix of business, together with the Company’s
emphasis on acquisition cost control. Segment other underwriting expenses increased by
$21.9 million as the Company expanded operations to support its increased business volume.
Contributing to these underwriting expense increases were an 84.8% ($170.9 million)
increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, a 36.3% ($32.7 million) increase in the
International operation, a 24.7% ($36.7 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation,
a $90.7 million increase in the Bermuda operation and a 2.3% ($3.1 million) increase in
the Specialty Underwriting operation. The changes for each operation’s expenses
principally resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium
volume and business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of
specific reinsurance as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business.
The Company’s expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by
net premiums earned, was 25.6% in 2003 compared to 27.3% in 2002.

Investments.

Net
investment income increased 14.8% to $402.6 million in 2003 from $350.7           million
in 2002, principally reflecting the effects of investing $1,653.8           million of
cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31,           2003, $209.9
million of net proceeds from Holdings’ issuance of junior


subordinated debt securities in November
2002 and $316.8 million of net proceeds from           the issuance of Group’s
common shares in April 2003, all partially offset           by the effects of the lower
interest rate environment.

Net realized capital losses were
$38.0 million in 2003, reflecting realized capital losses on the Company’s
investments of $88.7 million, which included $25.7 million relating to write-downs in the
value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, and $46.2
million related to the impairment on interest only strips in accordance with EITF
99-20, partially offset by $50.7 million of realized capital gains, which included
$16.8 million of realized capital gains on sales of the interest only strips, compared to
net realized capital losses of $50.0 million in 2002. The net realized capital losses in
2002 reflected realized capital losses on the Company’s investments of $142.8
million, which included $101.3 million relating to write-downs in the value of securities
deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, of which $33.0 million was for
WorldCom, Inc., partially offset by $92.8 million of realized capital gains. The company
owned no interest only strips during 2002.

The Company has a small number of
credit default swaps, which it no longer writes, and specialized equity put options in its
product portfolio. These products meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. Net derivative income from these derivative
transactions in 2003, was $5.9 million, which principally reflects changes in fair value
of the specialized equity put options, compared to net derivative expenses of $14.5
million in 2002, which principally related to the specialized equity put options. See also
Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other expense in 2003 was $1.0
million compared to $2.1 million in 2002. The decrease in net expenses for 2003 was due to
foreign exchange gains, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses.

Corporate underwriting expenses not
allocated to segments increased to $6.0 million for 2003 compared with $3.2 million for
2002 as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support increased business volume.

Interest expense in 2003 was $57.3
million compared to $44.6 million in 2002. Interest expense in 2003 reflected $38.9
million relating to the senior notes, $17.0 million relating to the junior subordinated
debt securities and $1.4 million relating to borrowings under the Company’s revolving
credit facility. Interest


expense in 2002 reflected $38.9 million relating to the issuance
of the senior notes, $2.2 million relating to the junior subordinated debt securities and
$3.5 million relating to borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility.

Income Taxes.

The Company
recognized income tax expense of $65.2 million in 2003 compared to $30.7 million in

.

The increase in taxes generally reflects the improved underwriting and
investment income results.

Net Income.

Net income was
$426.0 million in 2003 compared to net income of $231.3 million in 2002, reflecting
improved underwriting and investment income results partly offset by increased income
taxes.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of the
critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that (1) require management
to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the
consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions.

LOSS AND LAE RESERVES.

The
Company’s most critical accounting policy is the determination of its loss and LAE
reserves. The Company maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability for
losses and LAE with respect to reported and unreported claims relating to both its
insurance and reinsurance businesses. Because reserves are estimates of ultimate losses
and LAE, management, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques, monitors
reserve adequacy over time, evaluating new information as it becomes known and adjusting
reserves as necessary. Management considers many factors when setting reserves, including:
(1) the Company’s exposure base, generally its premiums earned; (2) its expected loss
ratios on current year writings as determined through extensive interaction between its
underwriters and actuaries by product and class categories; (3) internal actuarial
methodologies which analyze the Company’s loss reporting and payment experience with
similar cases, information from ceding companies and historical trends, such as reserving
patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and
liability; (5) economic conditions; and (6) the uncertainties discussed below regarding
reserve requirements for A&E claims. Based on these considerations, management
believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company’s insurance and
reinsurance loss and LAE reserves. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate,
perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the
change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes of the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The Company acknowledges that there
is more uncertainty in establishing loss reserves on assumed business as compared to
direct business. At December 31, 2004 the Company had assumed loss reserves of $5,939.1
million, of which $313.0 million were loss reserves on A&E business.

Reserving for assumed reinsurance
requires evaluating loss information received from ceding companies. Depending on the
type of contract and the contractual reporting requirements, ceding companies report
losses to the Company in many forms. Generally, proportional/quota share contracts
require the submission of a monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss
settlement activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the
ceding company. This information is recorded into the Company’s records. For certain
proportional contracts, there is also an individual loss reporting clause, which requires
a detailed loss report on claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a
particular type of loss. Excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require
individual loss reporting with precautionary notices generally sent when losses reach a
significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract. All individual loss
reports and supporting claim information are managed by the Company’s experienced
claims staff. Based on the evaluation of the claim, the Company may choose to establish
additional case reserves over that reported by the ceding company. The Underwriting,
Claim, Reinsurance Accounting and Internal Audit departments of the Company perform
various reviews of the ceding carriers, particularly larger ceding carriers, to ensure
that underwriting and claims procedures
meet required standards. The claim information received from the ceding


companies is
compiled into loss development triangles. Accepted actuarial methodologies, supplemented
by judgment where appropriate, are then used to develop the appropriate IBNR for the
Company. Included in the determination of IBNR, is a factor for reporting lags of the
ceded carriers. Each quarter, the Company compares its actual reported losses for the
quarter and cumulatively since the most recently completed reserve study to the expected reported
losses for the respective period, which may result in additional reserving actions. This
is done by aggregate class and/or type of business.
This information is used as a tool in the judgmental process by which
management assesses the overall adequacy of loss and LAE reserves.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
EXPOSURES.

The Company continues to receive claims under expired contracts, both
insurance and reinsurance, asserting alleged injuries and/or damages relating to or
resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos. The
Company’s asbestos claims typically involve potential liability for bodily injury
from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products
containing asbestos. The Company’s environmental claims typically involve potential
liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b)
bodily injury or property damages caused by the release of hazardous substances into the
land, air or water.

The Company’s reserves include
an estimate of the Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims. This estimate is
made based on judgmental assessment of the underlying exposures as the result of (1) long
and variable reporting delays, both from insureds to insurance companies and from ceding
companies to reinsurers; (2) historical data, which is more limited and variable on
A&E losses than historical information on other types of casualty claims; and (3)
unique aspects of A&E exposures for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using
traditional reserving techniques. There are significant uncertainties in estimating the
amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties
are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily
injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or
environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or
liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and
judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental
claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions
concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g)
uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or
environmental exposure.

With respect to asbestos claims in
particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound
the difficulty in estimating the Company’s liability. These developments include: (a)
continued growth in the number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive
plaintiff bar and including claims against defendants formerly regarded as
“peripheral”; (b) a disproportionate percentage of claims filed by individuals
with no functional injury, which should have little to no financial value but that have
increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the growth in the
number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims
(including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in which companies attempt to resolve their
asbestos liabilities in a manner that is prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers
from the negotiation of bankruptcy plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a small
number of states that favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims that might
impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product
liability portion; (f) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst
procedural abuses; (g) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants,
especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some states to
address asbestos litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or the U.S.
Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation.

Management believes that these
uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for A&E and particularly
asbestos losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves
for other types of losses. Given these uncertainties, management believes that no
meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established. The Company establishes
reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law
reflect an exposure for the Company or its ceding companies.


In connection with the acquisition of
Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, LM
provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the
first $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley’s reserves as of
September 19, 2000 and The Prudential guaranteed LM’s obligations to Mt.
McKinley. Cessions under this reinsurance agreement exhausted the limit available under
the contract at December 31, 2003. Due to the uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate
losses may vary materially from current loss reserves and, depending on coverage under the
Company’s various reinsurance arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See
also Note 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

With respect to Mt. McKinley, where
the Company has a direct relationship with policyholders, the Company’s aggressive
litigation posture and the uncertainties inherent in the asbestos coverage and bankruptcy
litigation have provided an opportunity to actively engage in settlement negotiations with
a number of those policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities.
Those discussions are oriented towards achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that
limit Mt. McKinley’s liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. In 2004, the
Company has concluded such settlements or reached agreement in principle with 9 of its
high profile policyholders. The Company currently has identified 15 policyholders based on
their past claim activity and/or potential future liabilities as “High Profile
Policyholders” and its settlement efforts are generally directed at such
policyholders, in part because their exposures have developed to the point where both the
policyholder and the Company have sufficient information to be motivated to settle. The
Company believes that this active approach will ultimately result in a more cost-effective
liquidation of Mt. McKinley’s liabilities than a passive approach, although it may
also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley’s losses and cash flows as
reserves are adjusted to reflect the development of negotiations and, ultimately,
potentially accelerated settlements.

There is less potential for similar
settlements with respect to the Company’s reinsurance asbestos claims. Ceding
companies, with their direct obligation to insureds and overall responsibility for claim
settlements, are not consistently aggressive in developing claim settlement information
and conveying this information to reinsurers, which can introduce significant and perhaps
inappropriate delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers. These
delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but also restrict the
information available to estimate the reinsurers’ ultimate exposure. At December 31,
2004 the Company had asbestos loss reserves of $632.3 million, of which $313.0 million was
for assumed business and $319.3 was for direct business. See the reserve discussion under
the heading Financial Condition.

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

The
Company utilizes reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and
catastrophic loss occurrences. These agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a
portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances without relieving the
insurer of its obligation to the policyholder. In the event reinsurers were unable to
meet their obligations under these reinsurance agreements or were able to successfully
challenge losses ceded by the Company under the reinsurance contracts, the Company would
not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balance. In some
cases, the Company may hold partial collateral, including letters of credit and funds
held arrangements, for these agreements. The Company establishes reserves for
uncollectible balances based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of the
outstanding balances. To minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables,
the Company has a reinsurance credit security committee that generally evaluates the
financial strength of a reinsurer prior to entering into a reinsurance arrangement.
Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the U.S. are
generally required to secure their obligations. Management believes that adequate
provision has been made for the Company’s uncollectible balances. Actual
uncollectible amounts may vary, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting
income in the period in which the change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Financial Condition.

PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED.

Premiums
written by the Company are earned ratably over the periods of the related insurance and
reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned premium reserves are established to cover the


remainder of the unexpired contract
period. Such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies
or computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data. Premiums earned, and the
related costs, which have not yet been reported to the Company, are estimated and
accrued. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies are used to estimate earned but not
reported premium at each financial reporting date.

the Company’s incurred losses and loss and LAE reserves. Commission expense and
incurred losses related to the change in earned but not reported premium is not
differentiated from current period reported premium and the effects of both are included
in current period company and segment financial results. See also Note 1 of Notes to the

INVESTMENT VALUATION.

The
Company’s investment portfolio consists of investments available for sale and
accordingly these securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis. Most securities
are traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available. The Company
holds some privately placed securities that are either valued by an investment advisor or
by the Company using cash flow projections. Through the second quarter of 2004 the Company
owned interest only strips that were accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20, which
set forth the rules for determining when these securities must be written down to fair
value due to impairment. Unrealized gains and losses from market fluctuations are
reflected as comprehensive income, while market value declines that are considered other
than temporary impairments are reflected in the income statement as realized capital
losses. The Company considers many factors when determining whether a market value decline
is other than temporary, including: (1) the length of time the market value has been below
book value, (2) the credit strength of the issuer, (3) the issuer’s market sector,
(4) the length of time to maturity and (5) for asset backed securities, increases in
prepayments. If management assessments change in the future, the Company may ultimately
record a realized loss after management originally concluded that the decline in value was
temporary. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH
AND INVESTED ASSETS.

Aggregate invested assets, including cash and
short-term investments, were $11,530.2 million at December 31, 2004, $9,321.3 million at
December 31, 2003 and $7,265.6 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in cash and
invested assets in 2004 from 2003 resulted primarily from $1,487.6 million in cash flows
from operations generated during 2004, $320.0 million from net proceeds of the issuance
of junior subordinated debt securities, $250 million from net proceeds of the issuance of
senior notes and $40.1 million in net pre-tax unrealized appreciation of the Company’s
investments, partially offset by a $70 million repayment on the revolving credit
agreement. The increase in cash and invested assets in 2003 from 2002 resulted primarily
from $1,653.8 million in cash flows from operations generated during 2003, $316.8


million of net proceeds from the
offering of common shares in April 2003 and $68.1 million in net unrealized appreciation
of the Company’s investments.

The Company’s current investment
strategy generally seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified,
taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level
of liquidity. Although not a primary objective, the Company actively considers total
return performance, in particular as respects the exposures of its fixed income portfolio
to variability in unrealized appreciation/depreciation as interest rates shift. The
Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously,
consistent with the Company’s current and projected operating results, market
conditions and the Company’s tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment
portfolio are comprised of available for sale securities. Additionally, the Company is
expanding its investments in equity securities, principally public equity index
securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the
investment portfolio.

Commencing with the second quarter of
2003 and through the second quarter of 2004, the Company had investments in interest only
strips. These investments were aimed at mitigating potential decreases in unrealized
appreciation on the Company’s fixed income portfolio during a period where management
judged that there was extraordinary potential for an increase in general interest rates.
These fixed maturity securities give the holder the right to receive interest payments at
a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments on the
outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash
flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the mortgage
pool. Generally, as market interest rates and, more specifically, market mortgage rates
decline, mortgagees tend to refinance which will decrease the average life of a mortgage
pool and decrease expected cash flows. Conversely, as market interest rates and, more
specifically, market mortgage rates rise, repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows
will tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to increase as
general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These movements
are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the Company’s other
fixed income investments. The Company liquidated its interest only strip investment
portfolio in the second quarter of 2004, at which point management concluded the
extraordinary potential for increases in general interest rates had subsided to a more
normal level.

The increase in short-term
investments is due principally to maintaining liquidity to repay the maturing $250 million
of senior notes due in March 2005. The increase in equity securities reflects a modest and
continuing reweighting of the Company’s target investment mix.

The Company, because of its
historical income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of
income yield and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a
measure of performance than its overall income yield. With changes the Company perceives
in overall investment market conditions, and more specifically the acquisition of $496.5
million of equity securities into the overall investment portfolio in 2004, the Company is
reexamining the weighting of total return in its overall investment strategy.

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

Reinsurance receivables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled $1,210.8 million at
December 31, 2004, $1,284.1 million at December 31, 2003, and $1,116.4 million at December
31, 2002. At December 31, 2004, $405.0 million, or 33.4%, was receivable from subsidiaries
of London Life. These receivables are effectively secured by a combination of letters of
credit and funds held arrangements under which the Company has retained the premium
payments due the retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced
such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire. In addition, $160.0
million, or 13.2%, was receivable from LM, whose obligations are guaranteed by The
Prudential, $132.5 million, or 10.9%, was receivable from Transatlantic and $100.0
million, or 8.3%, was receivable from Continental, which is partially secured by funds
held arrangements. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the
Company’s receivables.


LOSS AND LAE RESERVES.

Gross
loss and LAE reserves totaled $7,836.3 million at December 31, 2004, $6,361.2 million at
December 31, 2003, and $4,905.6 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in 2004, 2003
and 2002 is primarily attributable to increased premiums earned, increase in catastrophe
losses, net prior period reserve adjustments in select areas and normal variability in
claim settlements.

Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re
sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re. Business for this branch was previously
included in the International segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to
the sale and in accordance with FAS 131, the Company restated the International and
Bermuda segments for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 to conform to December 31,
2004 segment reporting.

The following tables summarize gross
outstanding loss and LAE reserves, segregated into case reserves and IBNR reserves, which
are managed on a combined basis, for the periods indicated.


The increases by segment generally
reflect increases in earned premium, changes in business mix and the impact of reserve
reestimations together with claim settlement activity. The fluctuations for A&E reflect
the impact of reserve reevaluations and claim settlement activity.

The Company’s loss and LAE
reserves reflect estimates of ultimate claim liability. Such estimates are reevaluated on
an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into
consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim
experience. The effect of such reevaluations impacts incurred losses for the current
period. The Company notes that its analytical methods and processes operate at multiple
levels including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of
business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the aggregate. The
complexities of the Company’s business and operations require analyses and
adjustments, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. Additionally, the
attribution of reserves, change in reserves and incurred losses, between accident year and
underwriting year requires adjustments and allocations, both qualitative and quantitative,
at these various levels. All of these processes, methods and practices appropriately
balance actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended
to assure the accuracy, precision and consistency of the Company’s reserving
practices, which are fundamental to the Company’s operation. The Company notes
however, that the underlying reserves remain estimates, which are subject to variation,
and that the relative degree of variability is generally least when reserves are
considered in the aggregate and generally increases as the focus shifts to more granular
data levels.

There can be no assurance that
reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future. However,
management believes that the Company’s existing reserves and reserving methodologies
lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In this context,
the Company notes that over the past 10 years, its past calendar year operations have been
affected variably by effects from prior period reserve re-estimates, with such effects
ranging from a favorable $35.4 million, representing 1.2% of the net prior period reserves
for the year in which the adjustment was made, to an unfavorable $312.0 million,
representing 6.0% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment
was made. The Company has noted that variability has increased over the past three years
and has taken actions to attempt to reduce this year to year variability prospectively.


The following table represents the
reserve levels and ranges as of December 31, 2004 for each of the Company’s business
segments.

The Company has included ranges for
loss reserve estimates determined by the Company’s actuaries, which are derived
through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. The Company notes that its
presentation of this information is not directly comparable to similar presentations of
other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards
governing such presentations. The Company further notes that its recorded reserves reflect
the Company’s best point estimate of its liabilities and that its actuarial
methodologies focus on such point estimates around which ranges are subsequently
developed.

Depending on the specific segment,
the range derived for the loss reserves, excluding reserves for A&E exposures, ranges
from minus 5.0% to minus 8.3% for the low range and from plus 5.0% to plus 8.3% for the
high range. Both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the Specialty
Underwriting segment. Within each range, management’s best estimate of loss reserves
is based on the point estimate

derived by the Company’s actuaries in detailed
reserve studies. Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally
accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development. In particular, the Company
notes that the width of the range is dependent on the level of confidence associated with
the outcome. For the above presentation, management has assumed what it believes is a
reasonable confidence level but notes that there can be no assurance that the
Company’s claim obligations will not vary within and potentially outside of these
ranges, requiring incurred loss adjustments in the period the variability is recognized.
The Company is not able to establish a meaningful range for A&E reserves.

Additional losses, including those
relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type
or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the Company or the reinsurance and insurance
industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not
covered by existing retrocessional


contracts, could have material
adverse effects on the Company’s future financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

The Company generally has exposure to
A&E losses through its Mt. McKinley operation with respect to insurance policies and
through Everest Re with respect to reinsurance contracts. In each case, the Company’s
management and analysis of its exposures takes into account a number of features of its
business that differentiate the Company’s exposures from many other insurers and
reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures.

Mt. McKinley
began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and           increased
the volume of its writings in 1977. These writings ceased in 1984,           giving Mt.
McKinley an approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure,           which is
appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with           significant A&E
exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and           standardization of policy forms,
it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s           to have been issued without
aggregate limits on at least the product liability           coverage offered; policies
issued in earlier decades are generally more at risk           of not having aggregate
limits.

The vast majority of Mt.
McKinley’s A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies, with
aggregate coverage limits, which by definition also have protection afforded by underlying
coverage. Mt. McKinley’s attachment points vary but usually are protected by
millions, often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying coverage. The excess nature of
most of Mt. McKinley’s policies also offers protection against non-product claims
(for example, claims arising under general liability coverage). Although under some
circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non-product claims, such claims
generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non-product claims are generally
less likely to aggregate. In addition, environmental claims arise under general liability
coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these claims tend to create exposure for
primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies.

Virtually all of the Mt. McKinley
policies that are still potentially exposed to claims have policy language providing that
expenses were paid within limits rather than in addition to limits. This is a substantial
difference from primary coverage, which would most often cover expenses in addition to
limits.

Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was
not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under which A&E exposures
generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E exposures through
contract exclusions effected in 1984. Therefore, Everest Re has an approximate 11-year
window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many reinsurance companies that have
significant A&E exposures. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re was not
as heavily involved in casualty business as in property business, which generally is not
exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re generally took smaller lines of exposure per
contract than many other reinsurers operating in the casualty reinsurance market and those
lines were generally also smaller than the excess limits provided by Mt. McKinley
policies. This means that the potential adverse development on Everest Re’s
reinsurance business would not be subject to the same level of volatility as would be the
case for companies having greater exposures per risk. Everest Re reinsured both primary
and excess policies. However, its claim experience to date indicates that the majority of
its reinsurance supported excess policies. As a result, most of Everest Re’s exposure
derives from excess policies similar to those written by Mt. McKinley.

With respect to both the Mt.
McKinley and Everest Re operations, the Company was not a member of the Asbestos Claims
Facility (“Wellington”) or the Center for Claims Resolution (“CCR”)
claim settlement facilities. Insurers supporting those facilities made broad commitments
concerning the application of insurance coverage to asbestos claims. With respect to its
direct insurance exposures, the fact that the Company has not made those commitments may
allow it to resolve insurance exposure to Wellington/CCR insureds more economically than
if it had joined these facilities. With respect to its reinsurance exposures, although
the Company was not a signatory to the Wellington or CCR facilities, it has, within the
bounds of its reinsurance contracts, generally supported ceding companies that were
signatories. Because the insurers supporting these


facilities have generally paid their
exposures more quickly than non-signatory insurers, the Company believes that this has
generally meant that it has paid its reinsurance exposure more quickly than it likely
would have if it had not been subject to Wellington/CCR payments.

The Company believes that its A&E
exposures are unique and differentiated, by the points noted above, from those insurers
and reinsurers with appreciable A&E exposure but there can be no assurance that such
factors will protect the Company from adverse development, perhaps material, or allow it
to secure advantages in the settlement of its claims obligations.


The following table summarizes
incurred losses with respect to A&E on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for
the periods indicated:

At December 31, 2004, the gross
reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $148.5 million representing case reserves
reported by ceding companies, $151.3 million representing additional case reserves
established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $272.1 million representing case
reserves established by the Company on direct insurance claims, including Mt. McKinley,
and $156.4 million representing IBNR reserves.

The gross incurred losses for A&E
exposures increased by $171.7 million and $172.6 million for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. These increases are the result of reevaluations by
management reflecting additional information received from insureds and ceding companies,
ongoing litigation, additional claims received and settlement activity. Management closely
monitors this additional information and adjusts reserves accordingly. The net incurred
losses primarily reflect the impact of the reinsurance agreement between Mt. McKinley and
LM.

Industry analysts have developed a
measurement, known as the survival ratio, to compare the A&E reserves among companies
with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a
company’s current net reserves by the three year average of paid losses, and
therefore measures the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves
based on historical payment patterns. Using this measurement, the Company’s net three
year A&E survival ratio was 5.2 years at December 31, 2004. Adjusting for the effect
of the reinsurance ceded under the reinsurance agreement with LM, this ratio rises to the
equivalent of 6.8 years at December 31, 2004. The cession of $160.0 million to the stop
loss reinsurance provided by LM in connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley results
in unpaid proceeds that are not reflected in past net payments and effectively extend the
funding available for future net payments.

Because the survival ratio was
developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and not of absolute reserve
adequacy, the Company considers, but does not rely on, the survival ratio when evaluating
its reserves.


In particular, the Company notes
that loss payout variability, which can be material, due in part to the Company’s
orientation to negotiated settlements, particularly on its Mt. McKinley exposures,
significantly impairs the credibility and utility of this measure as an analytical tool.
During 2004, the Company made asbestos net claim payments of $134.3 million on Mt
McKinley high profile claimants where the claim was either closed or a settlement was
reached. Such payments, which are effectively non-repetitive, do for 2004, and will for
2005 and 2006, distort the Company’s three year survival ratio. Adjusting for such
settlements, recognizing total settlements are generally considered fully reserved to an
agreed settlement, the Company considers that its adjusted survival ratio for net
unsettled claims is 16.0 years.

Developments in 2004 and 2003
affecting asbestos exposures in general and the Company’s asbestos exposures in
particular, together with enhancements in the Company’s claim management and
analytical processes, resulted in the reserve strengthening noted earlier. These
developments and actions have increased the emphasis on asbestos exposures as a separate
component of the Company’s A&E exposures. Despite the Company’s approach of
handling A&E exposures on a combined basis, management believes additional disclosure
of the asbestos element of its A&E exposures is appropriate.

The following tables summarize
reserve and claim activity for asbestos claims, on both a gross and net of ceded
reinsurance basis, for the periods indicated with particular emphasis on the
differentiation of insured categories within the Mt. McKinley operation, which the Company
believes reflects the most volatile element of its asbestos exposures for the years ended
December 31:




The Company’s net three year
survival ratio on its asbestos exposures only was 4.9 years for the period ended December
31, 2004. This three year survival ratio, when adjusted for the effect of the reinsurance
ceded under the stop loss cover from LM, was 6.8 years and, when adjusted for settlements
in place and structured settlements, which are either fully funded by reserves or subject
to financial terms that substantially limit the potential variability in the liability,
and the stop loss protection from LM, was 22.3 years.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY.

The Company’s shareholders’ equity increased to $3,712.5 million as of December 31,
2004 from $3,164.9 million as of December 31, 2003, principally reflecting $494.9 million
of net income in 2004, $26.5 million in net proceeds from options exercised, an increase
of $25.7 million in net unrealized appreciation of investments and a $22.9 million
increase in foreign currency translation, partially offset by $22.4 million in shareholder
dividends. The Company’s shareholders’ equity increased to $3,164.9 million as
of December 31, 2003 from $2,368.6 million as of December 31, 2002, principally reflecting
$426.0 million of net income in 2003, $316.8 million in net proceeds from Group’s
offering of 4.5 million common shares in April 2003, an increase of $36.4 million in net
unrealized appreciation of investments and a $22.2 million increase in foreign currency
translation, partially offset by $19.6 million in shareholder dividends. Dividends of
$22.4 million, $19.6 million and $16.3 million were declared and paid by the Company in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CAPITAL.

The Company’s business operations are in part dependent on the
Company’s financial strength, and the market’s perception thereof, as
measured by shareholders’ equity, which was $3,712.5 million and $3,164.9
million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company has flexibility
with respect to capitalization as a result of its perceived financial
strength, including its financial strength ratings as assigned by independent
rating agencies, and its access to the debt and equity markets. The Company
continuously monitors its capital and financial position, as well as investment
and security market conditions, both in general and with respect to the
Company’s securities, and responds accordingly.

From time to time the Company has
used open market share repurchases to effectively adjust its capital position. It made no
such purchases in 2004. In September 2004, the Company’s existing authorization to
purchase up to 1.7 million shares was amended to authorize the repurchase of up to 5
million shares. The Company notes that, outside of its open market repurchase program, it
repurchased 4,800 shares in 2004 from employees in connection with restricted share
vestings where individual employees chose to discharge withholding tax liabilities on
vesting shares by surrendering of a portion of such shares. At December 31, 2004, 5
million shares remained under the existing repurchase authorization.

The Company has a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”), which was declared effective by the SEC on December 22, 2003, that
provides for the issuance of up to $975 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf
registration statement, Group is authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt
securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings is authorized to issue debt
securities and Capital Trust II and Everest Re Capital Trust III (“Capital Trust
III”) are authorized to issue trust preferred securities. The following securities
have been issued pursuant to that registration statement, which at December 31, 2004 has a
remaining balance of $405.0 million.

o

On
March 29, 2004, Capital Trust II, an unconsolidated affiliate, issued trust preferred
securities resulting in a takedown from the shelf registration statement of $320 million.
In conjunction with the issuance of Capital Trust II’s trust preferred securities,
Holdings issued $329.9 million of 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities due March 29,
2034 to Capital Trust II. Part of the proceeds from the junior subordinated debt
securities issuance was used for capital contributions to Holdings’ operating
subsidiaries.


o

On
October 6, 2004, Holdings completed a public offering of $250.0 million principal amount
of 5.40% senior notes due October 15, 2014. The net proceeds will be utilized to retire
existing debt at Holdings, which is coming due in March 2005, and for other general
corporate purposes.

On July 30, 2002, the Company filed a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance of up to
$475.0 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group
was authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and
hybrid securities, Holdings was authorized to issue debt securities and Capital Trust was
authorized to issue trust preferred securities. This shelf registration statement became
effective on September 26, 2002 and was effectively exhausted with the April 23, 2003
transaction described below. The following securities were issued pursuant to that
registration statement.

o

On
November 14, 2002, pursuant to a trust agreement between Holdings and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, the property trustee, and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, the Delaware trustee, Capital
Trust, an unconsolidated affiliate, completed a public offering of $210.0 million of
7.85% trust preferred securities, resulting in net proceeds of $203.4 million. The
proceeds of the issuance were used to purchase $210 million of 7.85% junior subordinated
debt securities of Holdings that will be held in trust by the property trustee for the
benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities. In conjunction with the
issuance of Capital Trust’s trust preferred securities, Holdings issued $216.5
million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities due November 15, 2032 to Capital
Trust. The proceeds from the junior subordinated debt securities issuance were primarily
used for capital contributions to Holdings’ operating subsidiaries.

o

On
April 23, 2003, the Company expanded the size of the remaining shelf registration to $318
million by filing a Post-Effective Amendment under Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and General Instruction IV of Form S-3 promulgated there under. On the
same date, the Company issued 4,480,135 of its common shares at a price of $70.75 per
share, which resulted in $317.0 million in proceeds, before expenses of approximately
$0.2 million. This transaction effectively exhausted the September 26, 2002 shelf
registration.

Capital Trust will redeem all of the
outstanding trust preferred securities when the junior subordinated debt securities are
paid at maturity on November 15, 2032. Holdings may elect to redeem the junior
subordinated debt securities, in whole or in part, at any time after November 14, 2007. If
such an early redemption occurs, the outstanding trust preferred securities would also be
proportionately redeemed.

On November 7, 2001, the Company
filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance
of up to $575.0 million of common equity. On February 27, 2002, the Company completed an
offering of 5,000,000 of its common shares at a price of $69.25 per share, which resulted
in $346.3 million of proceeds before expenses of approximately $0.5 million related to the
offering. The Company has used the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate
purposes. On October 2, 2002, the Company filed a post-effective amendment to this
registration statement that removed the remaining securities from registration.

On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed
public offerings of $200.0 million principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15,
2010 and $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due March 15, 2005. During
2000, the net proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were distributed by
Holdings to Group.

LIQUIDITY.

The
Company’s current investment strategy generally seeks to maximize
          after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable bond and
          tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level
of           liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments
is           adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company’s current and
projected           operating results, market conditions and tax position. With changes
the Company           perceives in overall investment market conditions, and more
specifically


the           acquisition of $496.5
million of equity securities into the overall investment           portfolio in 2004, the
Company is reweighting its view of total return.

The Company’s liquidity
requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow
results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for
claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the
collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally
invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and investment income provides
additional funding for loss payments. The Company’s net cash flows from operating
activities were $1,487.6 million, $1,653.8 million and $742.7 million

for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, these cash flows
reflected net tax payments of $100.0 million, $52.6 million and $10.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively; catastrophe loss payments of
$201.6 million, $96.0 million and $62.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively; and a $46.8 million payment on a terminated annuity
reinsurance arrangement for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in net cash
flows from operations in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to higher claim
payments on catastrophes and increased A&E settlements, which totaled $187.1 million,
$43.3 million and $64.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The increase in cash flow from 2002 reflects business growth and favorable
underwriting results.

In periods for which disbursements
for claims and benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses exceed
premium inflows, cash flow from insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash
flow from operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income.
Additionally, cash flow from investment maturities, both short term investments and longer
term maturities, would further mitigate the impact on total cash flow.

As the exact timing of the payment of
claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains portfolios
of long term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments
that are intended to provide adequate cash for payment of claims. At December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003 the Company held cash and short-term investments of $770.8 million and
$336.7 million, respectively. Part of the short-term cash position at December 31, 2004
will be used to pay the $250 million of senior notes that come due on March 15, 2005. In
addition to these cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2004, the Company had
$0.3 billion, at fair value, of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing
within one year, $1.9 billion maturing within two to five years and $7.7 billion maturing
after five years. These securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and
positive cash flow from operations, provide adequate sources of liquidity for the expected
payment of losses in the near future. The Company does not anticipate selling securities
or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but has the ability to do so.
Management expects the trend of positive cash flow from operations, which in general
reflects the strength of overall pricing over the 2003 and 2004 years, to persist over the
near term. However, in the intermediate and long term, the trend continuation will be
impacted by the extent to which competitive pressures weaken overall pricing available in
the Company’s markets and the extent to which the Company successfully implements its
strategy of emphasizing profitability over volume should persist.

Effective December 8, 2004, Group,
Bermuda Re, and Everest International entered into a new three year, $750 million group
credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (“Group Credit Facility”). Wachovia
Bank is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility. The Group Credit Facility
consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $250 million of revolving credit for
liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of standby letters of
credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the option of each of the
borrowers, be either (1) Base Rate Loans (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of
the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or
the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the
fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depend on Group’s senior unsecured debt
rating.


Tranche two exclusively provides up
to $500 million for the issuance of standby letters of credit on a collateralized basis.

The Group Credit Facility requires
Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a
minimum net worth amount. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of (i) $2,373
million plus (ii) (A) 25% of consolidated net income for each of Group’s fiscal
quarters and (B) 50% of any increase in consolidated net worth attributable to the
issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. The base amount is reset at
the end of each fiscal year to be the greater of 70% of Group’s consolidated net
worth as of the last day of the fiscal year and the calculated minimum amount of net worth
prior to the last day of the fiscal year. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants.

During the year ended December 31,
2004, there were no borrowings under tranche one of the Group Credit Facility. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company has $66.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under
tranche two of the Group Credit Facility. In addition, the Company has $284.9 million in
letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004 under a $300 million bilateral
agreement with Citibank. All of these letters of credit are collateralized by the
Company’s cash and investments. These letters of credit are generally used to
collateralize reinsurance assumed by Bermuda Re from jurisdictions where collateralization
is generally required for the ceding company to receive credit for such reinsurance
recoverables from its principal regulator. Bermuda Re and Everest International also used
trust arrangements to provide collateralization to ceding companies, including affiliates.
The Company generally avoids providing collateral except where required for ceding
companies to receive credit from their regulators. Additionally, at December 31, 2004,
$188.9 million of assets were deposited in trust accounts, primarily on behalf of Bermuda
Re, as security for reinsurance recoverables of certain non-affiliated ceding companies.

Effective October 10, 2003, Holdings
entered into a new three year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of lenders, replacing the December 21, 1999, three year senior revolving credit
facility, which expired on December 19, 2003. Both the October 10, 2003 and December 21,
1999 senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the
“Holdings Credit Facility”. Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Holdings
Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general corporate
purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million
with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base Rate (as
defined below) or (2) an adjusted LIBOR plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of the
rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or the
Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the fees
payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings’ senior unsecured debt
rating.

The Holdings Credit Facility requires Holdings
to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1, Holdings to maintain a
minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its statutory
surplus at $1.0 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future
aggregate capital contributions. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance
with these covenants.

During the year ended December 31,
2004, there were payments made of $70.0 million and there were no incremental borrowings made under Holdings
Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2003, there were no payments made and
no incremental borrowings made under Holdings Credit Facility. During the year ended December
31, 2002, there were payments made of $80 million and new Holdings Credit Facility borrowings of
$45 million. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were outstanding Holdings Credit Facility
borrowings of $0.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively. Interest expense incurred in
connection with these borrowings was $1.2 million, $1.4 million and $3.5 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


The Company’s 2004 total cash
flow, as distinguished from its cash flow from operations, activity in 2004 included
$320.0 million of new investable cash from Holdings’ issuance of junior subordinated
debt securities in March and $246.7 million of new investable cash from Holdings’issuance
of senior notes securities in October. The total cash flow activity in 2003 included
$316.8 million of new investable cash resulting from Group’s offering of common
shares in April. The total cash flow activity in 2002 included $346.3 million of new
investable cash resulting from Group’s offering of common shares in February and
$209.9 million of new investable cash from Holdings’ issuance of junior subordinated
debt securities in November.

EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES.

As
with other reinsurers, the Company’s operating results and financial condition can be
adversely affected by volatile and unpredictable natural and other disasters, such as
hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions. Any such catastrophic
event could generate insured losses in one or many of the Company’s treaties or lines
of business, including property and/or casualty exposures. Although the Company attempts
to limit its exposure to acceptable levels, including through the purchase of reinsurance
when considered to be cost effective, it is possible that an actual catastrophic event or
multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.

The Company employs various
techniques, including licensed modeling software, to assess its accumulated exposure. Such
techniques are inherently more difficult to apply to non-property exposures. Accumulated
exposures with respect to catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the PML.
The Company defines PML as its anticipated maximum loss, taking into account contract
limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such
as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake of such a magnitude that it is expected to
occur once in every 100 years.

Management believes that the
Company’s greatest catastrophe exposure world wide from any single event is to a U.S.
earthquake affecting the west coast including workers’ compensation exposure where
the Company estimates it has a pre-tax PML exposure of $427 million. The Company further
estimates that its second largest exposure relates to a hurricane affecting the U.S. east
coast with a pre-tax PML of $390 million. There can be no assurance that the Company will
not experience losses from one or more catastrophic events that exceed, perhaps by a
substantial amount, its estimated PML.

The Company employs a retrocessional
approach under which the Company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business
written or exposure accumulations or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering
the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the
Company’s operations. All reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the
potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing, terms, conditions
and availability of such coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective protection. The
level of reinsurance coverage varies over time, reflecting the underwriter’s and/or
Company’s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the
reinsurance markets.

If a single catastrophe were to occur
that resulted in $427 million of gross loss and LAE in 2005 (an amount equivalent to the
Company’s PML including its property and workers’ compensation exposures),
management estimates that the effect on the Company’s income before and after taxes
would be approximately $427 million and $341 million, respectively. Such impact represents
approximately 9.2% of the Company’s beginning of year capital. Such estimates involve
multiple variables, including which Everest entity would experience the loss, and as a
result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded.

For 2003, 2004 and thus far in 2005,
the Company has chosen not to purchase corporate retrocessional protection and to
generally de-emphasize the purchase of specific reinsurance by its underwriters,
reflecting the Company’s view that its exposures, in the context of its capital and
financial position and current market pricing, do not warrant reinsurance purchases at
current retrocessional price levels. For 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased
accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage, which provided up to


$175.0
million of recoveries per accident year if Everest Re’s consolidated statutory basis
accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment point provided in the contract
for the respective accident years. Each arrangement provided for an adjustment premium,
which reduces the net benefit by approximately 50%, in the event that the coverage is
used. There are no remaining limits available under these coverages. See ITEM 1, “Business
— Risk Management and Retrocession Arrangements” for further details.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

The
following table shows the Company’s contractual obligations for the year ended
December 31, 2004:

The senior notes and junior
subordinated debt contractual obligations are the responsibility of Holdings. While the
Company has sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to
satisfy these obligations, and in particular has the current liquidity to payoff the 8.5%
senior notes maturing in March 2005, Holdings generally depends for its funding upon
dividends from Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary, capital contributions from
Group or access to the capital markets. The Company’s various operating insurance and
reinsurance subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle
outstanding reserves for losses and LAE. Management believes that the Company, and each of
its entities, have sufficient financial resources, or ready access thereto, to meet all
obligations.

DIVIDENDS

During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the
Company declared and paid shareholder dividends of $22.4 million, $19.6 million and $16.3
million, respectively. As an insurance holding company, the Company is partially dependent
on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to
its shareholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest
Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by
Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. Management expects
that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest
Re’s ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Holdings’
general corporate needs and Holdings’ and Bermuda Re’s ability to declare and
pay dividends sufficient to support Group’s general corporate needs. For the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Everest Re paid dividends to Holdings of $70
million, $45 million and $85 million, respectively. Bermuda Re paid dividends to Group of
$15 million in 2004. See ITEM 1, “Business – Regulatory Matters –
Dividends” and Note 14A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


APPLICATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In January 2003, FASB issued
Financial Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”(“FIN
46”). FIN 46 addresses whether certain types of entities, referred to as variable
interest entities (“VIEs”), should be consolidated or deconsolidated in a
company’s financial statements. During October 2003, the FASB deferred the effective
date of FIN 46 provisions for VIEs created prior to February 1, 2003 to the first
reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. During December 2003, the FASB issued
FIN 46R, replacing FIN 46. FIN 46R is effective, for entities that had not adopted FIN 46
as of December 24, 2003, no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends on
or after March 15, 2004. The Company adopted FIN 46R in the first quarter of 2004,
resulting in the deconsolidation of Everest Re Capital Trust (“Capital Trust”)
and Everest Re Capital Trust II (“Capital
Trust II”). For 2003 and 2002, where applicable, the financial statements have been
restated to reflect the deconsolidation.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issue
Task Force (“EITF”) reached a final consensus on Issue 03-1, “The Meaning
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”. This
issue establishes guidance for determining whether to record impairment losses associated
with investments in certain equity and debt securities. The application of this issue was
required for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004. On September 30, 2004, the
FASB issued a FASB Staff Position EITF Issue 03-1-1, which delayed the effective date for
the measurement and recognition guidance included in paragraphs 10 through 20 of EITF
Issue 03-1. The Company is unable to predict the impact on other-than-temporary
impairments until the guidance is finalized. Currently, the Company continues to apply
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“FAS 115”), and the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)‘s Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5:M,
“Other Than Temporary Impairment Of Certain Investments In Debt And Equity
Securities” and believes that unrealized losses in its investment portfolio are
temporary in nature.

In December 2004, the Financial
accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Statement 123(R) “Share-Based
Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”). FAS 123(R) requires all share-based compensation
awards granted, modified or settled after December 15, 1994 to be accounted for using the
fair value method of accounting. Under the modified prospective application, compensation
cost is recognized for the outstanding, non-vested awards based on the grant date fair
value of those awards as calculated under FAS 123. The Company does not expect the
adoption of the statement to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition or results of operation. The application of this issue will become effective
for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005.

MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS

The SEC’s Financial Reporting
Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial
statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative
commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, “market
sensitive instruments”). The Company does not generally enter into market sensitive
instruments for trading purposes.

The Company’s current
investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality,
diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an
adequate level of liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced
investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with its current and projected operating
results, market conditions and the Company’s tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment
portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, the
Company invests in equity securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted
total return of the investment portfolio. The Company has also engaged in a small number
of credit default swaps and specialized equity options.

The overall investment strategy
considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular,
estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability
transactions, together with the Company’s capital structure and other factors, are
used to develop a net liability analysis. This


analysis includes estimated payout
characteristics for which the investments of the Company provide liquidity. This analysis
is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation,
duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure
principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period, including the
acquisition of interest only strips in 2003 and early 2004, which market value increases
as interest rates rise and decreases as interest rates fall. The addition of these
securities to the portfolio reduced the impact of interest rate shift on the entire
portfolio. As interest rates rose during the second quarter of 2004, the Company fully
liquidated its interest only strip investment portfolio.

The Company’s $11.5 billion
investment portfolio at December 31, 2004 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are
subject to interest rate risk and foreign currency rate risk, and equity securities, which
are subject to equity price risk. The impact of these risks on the investment portfolio is
generally mitigated by changes in the value of operating assets and liabilities and their
associated income statement impact.

Interest rate risk is the potential
change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, due to
change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, it includes
prepayment risk on the $1,474.0 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $9,947.2
million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated
principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the
security.


The tables below display the
potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on the
Company’s fixed maturity portfolio as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 based on parallel
200 basis point shifts in interest rates up and down in 100 basis point increments. For
legal entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each
security individually. To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed
securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments
were taken into account. For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency,
the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the
market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios. All amounts are in
U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. In general, for 2003,
the lower volatility was attributable to the Company’s investments in interest only
strips, the effect of which was to reduce overall portfolio duration and therefore
sensitivity to interest rate moves.

The Company had $7,836.3 million and
$6,361.2 million of reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2004
and December 31, 2003. These amounts are recorded at their nominal or estimated ultimate
payment amount, as opposed to fair value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to
reflect the time value of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the fair
value of the reserves is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the fair
value of the reserves decreases and conversely, if interest rates decline, the fair value
will increase. These movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair
value of investments since reserves are future obligations. While the difference between
fair value and nominal value is not reflected in the Company’s financial statements,
the Company’ financial results will include investment income over time from the
investment portfolio until the claims are paid. The Company’s loss and loss reserve
obligations have an expected duration of approximately 4.5 years, which is reasonably
consistent with the Company’s fixed income portfolio. If the company were to discount
its loss and LAE reserves, net of reinsurance receivable on unpaid losses, the discount
would be approximately $1.5 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of
approximately $5.2 billion, representing approximately 50% of the fixed maturity market value.
The existence of such obligations, and the variable differential between ultimate and fair
value, which in theory applies equally to invested assets and insurance liability,
provides substantial mitigation of the economic effects of interest rate variability even
though such mitigation is not reflected in the Company’s financial statements.

Foreign currency rate risk is the
potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. Each of the Company’s non-U.S./Bermuda (“foreign”)
operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location
consistent with local regulatory guidelines.  Generally, the Company prefers to
maintain the capital of its operations in U.S. dollar assets, although this


varies by
regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation may
conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in
which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations
are the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. The Company mitigates
foreign exchange exposure by a general matching of the currency and duration of its
assets to its corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52, the Company translates the assets,
liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S.
dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income.
As of December 31, 2004, there has been no material change in exposure to foreign
exchange rates as compared to December 31, 2003.

The tables below display the
potential impact of a parallel 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the
valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure in 10% increments as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003. This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation
from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of
translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. The growth in
exposure between 2004 and 2003 principally arises from increases in the level of foreign
currency investments, which are generally commensurate with changes in the Company’s
mix of business. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions.

Equity risk is the potential change
in market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios arising from changing
equity prices. The Company invests in exchange traded and mutual funds, which invest
principally in high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major
exchanges in the U.S.. The primary objective in managing the equity portfolio is to
provide long-term capital growth through market appreciation and income.


The tables below display the impact
on market value and after-tax unrealized appreciation of a 20% change in equity prices up
and down in 10% increments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The growth in exposure is
primarily due to the growth in the equity portfolio. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and
are presented in millions.

Although not considered material in
the context of the Company’s aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments, the
Company has issued five specialized equity put options based on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”) index that are market sensitive and sufficiently
unique to warrant supplemental disclosure.

During 2001, the Company sold five
specialized equity put options based on the S&P 500 index for total consideration, net
of commissions, of $16.9 million. These contracts each have a single exercise date, with
maturities ranging from 18 to 30 years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to
$1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is at
or above the strike price on the exercise dates. If the S&P 500 index is lower than
the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately
with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical
index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2004 index value, the Company estimates
the probability for each contract of the S&P 500 index being below the strike price on
the exercise date to be less than 6.4%. The theoretical maximum payouts under the
contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P 500 index value were
zero.

As these specialized equity put
options are derivatives within the framework of FAS 133, the Company reports the fair
value of these instruments in its balance sheet and records any changes to fair value in
its statement of operations. The Company has recorded fair values for its obligations on
these specialized equity put options at December 31, 2004 and 2003 of $21.5
million and $16.5 million, respectively; however, the Company does not believe that the
ultimate settlement of these transactions is likely to require a payment that would exceed
the initial consideration received or any payment at all.

As there is no active market for
these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted
option pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions, including those regarding
volatility and expected rates of return.


The tables below estimate the impact
of potential movements in interest rates and the S&P 500 index, which are the
principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair
value at December 31, 2004 and 2003. These are estimates and there can be no assurance
regarding future market performance. The asymmetrical results of the interest rate and
S&P 500 index shifts reflect that the liability cannot fall below zero whereas it can
increase to its theoretical maximum.

update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors, in
addition to the other information provided in this report, should be considered when
evaluating the Company. If the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors
materialize, the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of the Company’s
common shares could decline significantly.

RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY’S
BUSINESS

The Company’s results could
be adversely affected by catastrophic events.

Like all insurance and reinsurance
companies, the Company is exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events, including
weather-related and other natural catastrophes, as well as acts of terrorism. Any material
reduction in the Company’s operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more
catastrophes could inhibit its ability to pay dividends or to meet its interest and
principal payment obligations. The Company defines a catastrophe as an event that causes a
pre-tax loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least $5.0 million, before
corporate level reinsurance and taxes. By way of illustration, during the past five
calendar years, pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of contract specific reinsurance but
before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs, were as follows:

Calendar year

Pre-tax catastrophe losses


$

403.0 million


$

36.8 million


$

30.2 million


$

222.6 million


$

13.9 million


If the Company’s loss
reserves are inadequate to meet its actual losses, net income would be reduced or it could
incur a loss.

The Company is required to maintain
reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses
for both reported and unreported claims incurred. These reserves are only estimates of
what the Company believes the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on
facts and circumstances known to it. In setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities,
the Company relies on claim data supplied by its ceding companies and brokers. This
information is not always timely or accurate and can result in inaccurate loss
projections. Because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves and LAE,
the Company cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of
losses and loss adjustment reserves. If the Company’s reserves are insufficient to
cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, the Company would have to augment
its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings. These charges could be material. By way
of illustration, during the past five calendar years, the reserve re-estimation process
affected the Company’s net income in the following manner:

Calendar year

Effect on pre-tax net income


$

312.0 million decrease


$

256.9 million decrease


$

140.1 million decrease


$

no change


$

7.8 million decrease

See ITEM 1, “Business —
Changes in Historical Reserves,” which provides a more detailed chart showing the
effect of reserve re-estimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years.

The difficulty in estimating the
Company’s reserves is increased because loss reserves include reserves for potential
A&E liabilities. A&E liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons,
including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury
or property damage, difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental
contamination, long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for
the asbestos or environmental damage. Legal tactics and judicial and legislative
developments affecting the scope of insurers’ liability, which can be difficult to
predict, also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for A&E liabilities.

The failure to accurately assess
underwriting risk could reduce the Company’s net income or generate a net loss.

The Company’s success depends on
its ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the
risk is retained. If the Company fails to accurately assess the risks it retains, it may
fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover its losses and LAE. This could reduce
the Company’s net income and even result in a net loss. Losses may arise from events
or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced. An example of an
unanticipated event is the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Neither the magnitude
of loss on a single line of business nor the combined impact on several lines of business
from an act of terrorism on such a large scale was contemplated when the Company priced
its coverages. In addition to unanticipated events, the Company also faces the
unanticipated expansion of its exposures, particularly in long-tail liability lines. An
example of this is the ongoing expansion of the scope of insurers’ legal liability
for A&E exposures discussed above.


Decreases in pricing for property
and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce the Company’s net income.

The Company writes primarily property
and casualty reinsurance and insurance. The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses
are highly competitive, yet cyclical by product and market. These cycles, as well as other
business, economic and societal trends that influence aggregate supply and demand for
property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products, are outside of the
Company’s control.

In 2004, the favorable market
conditions, which had developed during 2000 through 2003, generally began to weaken. There
were signs that pricing for most property classes declined modestly and that pricing for
most casualty classes softened. Competition increased in part due to the relative
profitability achieved by many reinsurers over 2002 and 2003 and the attendant buildup of
capital in these market participants. However, this profitability and capital buildup
varied significantly by participant reflecting the fact that the industry generally still
remained exposed to fundamental issues that had negatively impacted its aggregate capacity
in 2002 and 2003, including weak investment market conditions and adverse loss emergence.
Both of these had tended to depress the industry’s aggregate financial performance
and perceptions of financial strength of industry participants over this period albeit
with significant variation by individual market participant. The industry experienced a
record level of catastrophe losses during 2004, particularly in the second half of the
year, and it remains unclear whether the aggregate catastrophe losses experienced by the
industry will reverse, stop or even moderate the trends toward market softening,
particularly as respects property classes. Further discussion of competitive issues can be
found in ITEM 1, “Business – Competition”.

If rating agencies downgrade their
ratings of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries, future prospects for growth and
profitability could be significantly and adversely affected.

The Company’s insurance company
subsidiaries, other than Mt. McKinley, which is in runoff, currently hold an “A+
(“Superior”)” financial strength rating from A.M. Best. Everest Re, Bermuda
Re and Everest National hold an “AA– (“Very Strong”)” financial
strength rating from Standard & Poor’s. Everest Re and Bermuda Re hold an
“Aa3 (“Excellent”)" financial strength rating from Moody’s.
Financial strength ratings are used by insurers and reinsurance and insurance
intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of
reinsurers. In addition, an unfavorable rating or the lack of a rating of its reinsurers
may adversely affect the rating of a company purchasing reinsurance. A downgrade or
withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect the Company’s ability to
market its insurance products and could have a material and adverse effect on future
prospects for growth and profitability. During the last five years, no active subsidiary
of the Company had experienced financial strength rating downgrade. However, the Company
cannot assure that a downgrade will not occur in the future. Consistent with market
practice, many of the Company’s treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company
to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of the Company’s obligations in
the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold. The termination provision would
generally be triggered only if a rating fell below A.M. Best’s A- rating level, which
is three levels below Everest Re’s current rating of A+. Everest Re also has more
modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of
outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade. That provision would
also generally be triggered only if Everest Re’s rating fell below A.M. Best’s
A- rating level.

The Company’s
reinsurers may not satisfy their obligations.

The Company is subject to credit
risk with respect to its reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not
relieve it of its liability to the insured. In addition, reinsurers may be unwilling to
pay the Company even though they are able to do so. The failure of one or more of the
Company’s reinsurers to honor their obligations to it in a timely fashion would
impact its cash flow and reduce its net income and could cause it to incur a significant
loss.


If the Company is unable or
chooses not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers, its net income could
be reduced or it could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss experience.

The Company is generally less reliant
on the purchase of reinsurance than many of its competitors, in part because of its
strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in its
business. The Company tries to separate its risk taking process from its risk mitigation
process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance. Thus, the
Company generally evaluates, underwrites, selects and prices its products prior to
consideration of reinsurance. However, the Company’s underwriters generally consider
purchasing reinsurance with respect to specific insurance contracts or programs, and its
senior management generally considers purchasing reinsurance with respect to its overall
operations, where reinsurance is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or is
expected to have a positive cost/benefit relationship. Since the Company generally
purchases reinsurance only when it expects a net benefit, the percentage of business that
it reinsures, as indicated in the chart below, varies considerably from year to year,
depending on its view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the
contract period.






Percentage of ceded written premiums to gross written premiums


.7%


.6%


.3%


.8%


.0%

Changes in the availability and cost
of reinsurance, which are subject to market conditions that are outside of the
Company’s control, have thus reduced to some extent its ability to use reinsurance to
tailor the risks it assumes on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance
exposures across its reinsurance operations. Because the Company has reduced its level of
reinsurance purchases, its net income could be reduced in the event of a large unreinsured
event or adverse overall experience.

The Company’s industry is
highly competitive and it may not be able to compete successfully in the future.

The Company’s industry is highly
competitive and subject to pricing cycles that can be particularly pronounced. The ease of
entry for well-capitalized competitors further exacerbates this market cycle. The Company
competes on a global basis in the U.S., Bermuda and other international markets. According
to Standard & Poor’s, the Company ranks among the top ten global reinsurance
groups where 80% of the market share is concentrated. The top twenty groups in the
Company’s industry represent 95% of the market’s revenues. The leaders in this
market are Munich Re, Swiss Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Hannover Re and Employers Re. Relative
to the Company, some of these competitors may have greater financial resources, longer
operating histories, and extensive business relationships that transcend the industry, any
of which can be a significant competitive advantage. Forces outside the industry can also
impact the Company’s market, including such factors as economic, regulatory, legal,
and geophysical. The Company may not be able to compete successfully in the future should
there be a significant change to the competitive landscape of its market.

The Company is dependent
on its key personnel.

The Company’s success has been,
and will continue to be, dependent on the ability to retain the services of existing key
executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the
future. The loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire
and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect the
ability of the Company to conduct business. Generally, the Company considers key
executive officers to be those individuals who have the greatest influence in setting
overall policy and controlling operations: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph
V. Taranto (age 56), President and Chief Operating Officer, Thomas J. Gallagher (age 56),
and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Stephen L. Limauro (age 53). Of
those three officers, the Company only has an employment contract with Mr. Taranto. That
contract has been previously filed with the SEC and was most recently amended on April
18, 2003 to extend Mr. Taranto’s term of employment from March 31, 2004 until March
31, 2006. The Company is


not aware that any of the above
three officers are planning to leave the Company or retire in the near future. The
Company does not maintain any key employee insurance on any of its employees.

Special considerations apply to the
Company’s Bermuda operations. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians, other than spouses
of Bermudians and individuals holding permanent resident certificates, are not permitted
to engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without a work permit issued by the Bermuda
government. A work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that, after
a proper public advertisement, no Bermudian, spouse of a Bermudian or individual holding a
permanent resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards for the
position. The Bermuda government has announced a policy that places a six-year term limit
on individuals with work permits, subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be
key employees. Currently, all six of the Company’s Bermuda-based professional
employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the Bermuda government
that expire at various times between March 2006 and February 2008. This includes Mark de
Saram, the chief executive officer of the Company’s Bermuda reinsurance operation. In
the event his work permit were not renewed, the Company could lose his services, thereby
adversely affecting its ability to conduct its business in Bermuda until it was able to
replace him with an individual in Bermuda who did not require a work permit or who was
granted the permit.


The value of the Company’s
investment portfolio and the investment income it receives from that portfolio could
decline as a result of market fluctuations and economic conditions.

A significant portion of the
Company’s investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and smaller
portions consist of equity securities and other investments. Both the fair market value of
these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general
economic and market conditions. For example, the fair market value of the Company’s
fixed income securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with
fluctuations in interest rates. The fair market value of its fixed income securities can
also decrease as a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit
quality of those securities to deteriorate. The net investment income that the Company
realizes from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or
decrease with interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations also can cause net investment
income from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other
asset-backed securities, to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at
the time of purchase. In addition, if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet
their obligations, investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may
arise. Because all of the Company’s securities are classified as available for sale,
changes in the market value of its securities are reflected in its financial statements.
Similar treatment is not available for liabilities. As a result, a decline in the value of
the securities in the Company’s portfolio could reduce its net income or cause it to
incur a loss. The following table quantifies the portion of the Company’s investment
portfolio that consists of fixed income securities, equity securities and investments that
carry prepayment risk.

Further discussion of
market-sensitive instruments can be found in ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

—

Market
Sensitive

Instruments”.

The Company may experience foreign
currency exchange losses.

The Company’s functional
currency is the U.S. dollar. However, the Company writes a portion of its business in
currencies other than U.S. dollars. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
wrote approximately 23.5% of its reinsurance coverages in currencies other than U.S.
dollars. The Company also maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in investments
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2004, the Company
maintained approximately 10.7% of its investment portfolio in investments denominated in
currencies other than U.S. dollars. Consequently, quarterly exchange rate fluctuations
may have a material impact on the Company’s quarterly net income. During 2004, 2003,
2002, the impact on the Company’s quarterly pre-tax net income from exchange rate
fluctuations ranged from a loss of $3.6 million to a gain of $7.8 million. Further
discussion of foreign currency rate risk can be found in ITEM 7,


“Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Market Sensitive
Instruments”.

RISKS RELATING TO
REGULATION

Insurance laws and regulations
restrict the Company’s ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws
and regulations could have a material adverse effect on its business.

The Company is subject to extensive
and increasing regulation under U.S., state and foreign insurance laws. These laws limit
the amount of dividends that can be paid to the Company by its operating subsidiaries,
impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that the Company can hold,
prescribe solvency, accounting and internal control standards that must be met and
maintained and require the Company to maintain reserves. These laws also require
disclosure of material intercompany transactions and require prior approval of
“extraordinary” transactions. These “extraordinary” transactions
include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds.
These laws also generally require approval of changes of control of insurance companies.
The application of these laws could affect the Company’s liquidity and ability to pay
dividends, interest and other payments on securities, as applicable, and could restrict
the ability to expand business operations through acquisitions of new insurance
subsidiaries. In addition, the Company cannot assure that it will have or can maintain all
required licenses and approvals or that its business fully complies with the wide variety
of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the
laws and regulations. If the Company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals or
does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory
authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend the Company from carrying on some or all
activities or monetarily penalize the Company. These types of actions could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business. To date, no material fine, penalty
or restriction has been imposed on the Company for failure to comply with any insurance
law or regulation.

Regulatory challenges in the U.S.
could adversely affect the ability of Bermuda Re to conduct business.

Bermuda Re does not intend to be
licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any U.S. jurisdiction. Under current
law, Bermuda Re generally will be permitted to reinsure U.S. risks from its office in
Bermuda without obtaining those licenses. However, the insurance and reinsurance
regulatory framework has become subject to increased scrutiny. In the past, there have
been congressional and other initiatives in the U.S. regarding increased supervision and
regulation of the insurance industry, including proposals to supervise and regulate
reinsurers domiciled outside the U.S. If Bermuda Re were to become subject to any
insurance laws of the U.S. or any U.S. state at any time in the future, it might be
required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from
engaging in lines of business or from writing some types of policies. Complying with those
laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to conduct
business in Bermuda and international markets.

Bermuda Re may need to be licensed
or admitted in additional jurisdictions to develop its business.

As Bermuda Re’s business
develops, it will monitor the need to obtain licenses in jurisdictions other than Bermuda
and the UK where it has an authorized branch in order to comply with applicable law or to
be able to engage in additional insurance-related activities. In addition, Bermuda Re may
be at a competitive disadvantage in jurisdictions where it is not licensed or does not
enjoy an exemption from licensing relative to competitors that are so licensed or exempt
from licensing. Bermuda Re may not be able to obtain any additional licenses that it
determines are necessary or desirable. Furthermore, the process of obtaining those
licenses is often costly and may take a long time.


Bermuda Re’s ability to write
reinsurance may be severely limited if it is unable to arrange for security to back its
reinsurance.

Many jurisdictions do not permit
insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or
non-admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements without appropriate
security. Bermuda Re’s reinsurance clients typically require it to post a letter of
credit or enter into other security arrangements. If Bermuda Re is unable to obtain or
maintain a letter of credit facility on commercially acceptable terms or is unable to
arrange for other types of security, its ability to operate its business may be severely
limited. If Bermuda Re defaults on any letter of credit that it obtains, it may be
required to prematurely liquidate a substantial portion of its investment portfolio and
other assets pledged as collateral.

RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY’S
SECURITIES

Because of the Company’s
holding company structure, its ability to pay dividends, interest and principal is
dependent on its receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its
subsidiaries.

The Company and Holdings are holding
companies, each of whose most significant assets consists of the stock of their operating
subsidiaries. As a result, each of the Company’s and Holdings’ ability to pay
dividends, interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the
earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries
to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it. This ability is subject to general
economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond the Company’s
control. Payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating
subsidiaries are regulated by U.S., state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory
restrictions, including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. Accordingly, the
operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to the
Company and Holdings in the future, which could prevent it from paying dividends, interest
or other payments on its securities.

Provisions in the Company’s
bye-laws could have an anti-takeover effect, which could diminish the value of its common
shares.

The Company’s bye-laws contain
provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to
replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In addition,
these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might
consider favorable. The effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from
receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered
by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change
in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing
market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in
the future.

For example, the Company’s
bye-laws contain the following provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect:

o

election
of directors is staggered, meaning that the members of only one of three classes of
directors are selected each year;

o

shareholders
have limited ability to remove directors;

o

the
total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 9.9% of the common shares will be
reduced to 9.9% of the total voting power of the common shares;

o

the
board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has reason
to believe that the transfer would result in:


o

any
person that is not an investment  company  beneficially  owning more than 5.0% of any
class of the issued and          outstanding share capital of the Company,

o

any
person holding  controlled  shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the issued and
outstanding share capital          of the Company, or

o

any
 adverse  tax,  regulatory  or legal  consequences  to the  Company,  any of its
 subsidiaries  or any of its shareholders;

o

the
Company also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholder’s
common shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or
advisable to avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if:

o

any
person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than 5.0% of any class of
the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company,

o

any
person holds  controlled  shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the issued and
 outstanding  share capital          of the Company, or

o

share
ownership by any person may result in adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to
the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder.

The Board of Directors has indicated
that it will apply these bye-law provisions in such manner that “passive
institutional investors” will be treated similarly to investment companies. For this
purpose, “passive institutional investors” include all persons who are eligible,
pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b)(1) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to file a
short-form statement on Schedule 13G, but excluding any insurance company or any parent
holding company or control person of an insurance company.

Applicable insurance laws may also
have an anti-takeover effect.

Before a person can acquire control
of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance
commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled. Prior to granting
approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company, a state
insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the
applicant, the integrity and competence of the applicant’s board of directors and
executive officers, the acquiror’s plans for changes to the insurance company’s
board of directors and executive officers, the acquiror’s plans for the future
operations of the insurance company and any anti-competitive results that may arise from
the consummation of the acquisition of control. Because any person who acquired control of
the Company would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries
in the U.S., the insurance change of control laws of Delaware, Arizona, California and
Georgia would apply to such a transaction. This could have the effect of delaying or even
preventing such a change of control.

Investors in the Company may have
more difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a U.S. corporation.

The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda
(the “Companies Act”), differs in material respects from the laws applicable to
U.S. corporations and their shareholders. The following is a summary of material
differences between the Companies Act, as modified in some instances by provisions of the
Company’s bye-laws, and Delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for
investors in the Company to protect their interests than investors in a U.S. corporation.
Because the following statements are summaries, they do not address all aspects of Bermuda
law that may be relevant to the Company and its shareholders.


Alternate Directors.

The
Company’s bye-laws provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that each director may
appoint an alternate director, who shall have the power to attend and vote at any meeting
of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not personally present
and to sign written consents in place of that director. Delaware law does not provide for
alternate directors.

Committees of the Board of
Directors.

The Company’s bye-laws provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that the
board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board appoints,
and those committees may consist partly or entirely of non-directors. Delaware law allows
the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to committees, but
those committees may consist only of directors.

Interested Directors.

Bermuda
law and the Company’s bye-laws provide that if a director has a personal interest in
a transaction to which the Company is also a party and if the director discloses the
nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity, either at a meeting of
directors or in writing to the directors, then the Company will not be able to declare the
transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest and the director
will not be liable to the Company for any profit realized from the transaction. In
addition, after a director has made the declaration of interest referred to above, he or
she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and
to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest, unless disqualified from
doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting. Under Delaware law, an interested
director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director derived an improper
personal benefit. Additionally, under Delaware law, a corporation may be able to declare a
transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the following conditions
is fulfilled:

o

the
material facts as to the interested director’s relationship or interests are
disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes
the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors,

o

the
material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the
transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of
a majority of the voting shares or

o

the
transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or
ratified.

Transactions with Significant
Shareholders.

As a Bermuda company, the Company may enter into business transactions
with its significant shareholders, including asset sales, in which a significant
shareholder receives, or could receive, a financial benefit that is greater than that
received, or to be received, by other shareholders with prior approval from the
Company’s board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the
shareholders. In the case of an amalgamation, in which two or more companies join together
and continue as a single company, a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of
at least 75% of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of
directors, except in the case of an amalgamation with and between wholly-owned
subsidiaries. If the Company were a Delaware corporation, any business combination with an
interested shareholder (which, for this purpose, would include mergers and asset sales of
greater than 10% of the Company’s assets that would otherwise be considered
transactions in the ordinary course of business) within a period of three years from the
time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval from
shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the Company’s outstanding common shares not
owned by the interested shareholder, unless the transaction qualified for one of the
exemptions in the relevant Delaware statute or the Company opted out of the statute. For
purposes of the Delaware statute, an “interested shareholder” is generally
defined as a person who together with that person’s affiliates and associates owns,
or within the previous three years did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s
outstanding voting shares.

Takeovers.

Under
Bermuda law, if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and,           within
four months of the offer, the holders of not less than 90% of the shares           that
are the subject of the offer tender their shares, the acquiror may give the
          nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the
          terms of


the offer. Within one month of
receiving the notice, dissenting           shareholders may apply to the court objecting
to the transfer. The burden is on           the dissenting shareholders to show that the
court should exercise its           discretion to enjoin the transfer. The court will be
unlikely to do this unless           there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion
between the acquiror and           the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing
out minority shareholders.           Under another provision of Bermuda law, the holders
of 95% of the shares of a           company (the “acquiring shareholders”) may
give notice to the           remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares
on the terms           described in the notice. Within one month of receiving the notice,
dissenting           shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their
shares. Within one           month of the court’s appraisal, the acquiring
shareholders are entitled           either to acquire all shares involved at the price
fixed by the court or cancel           the notice given to the remaining shareholders. If
shares were acquired under           the notice at a price below the court’s
appraisal price, the acquiring           shareholders must either pay the difference in
price or cancel the notice and           return the shares thus acquired to the
shareholder, who must then refund the           purchase price. There are no comparable
provisions under Delaware law.

Inspection of Corporate
Records.

Members of the general public have the right to inspect the public documents
of the Company available at the office of the Registrar of Companies and the
Company’s registered office, both in Bermuda. These documents include the memorandum
of association, which describes the Company’s permitted purposes and powers, any
amendments to the memorandum of association and documents relating to any increase or
reduction in the Company’s authorized share capital. Shareholders of the Company have
the additional right to inspect the Company’s bye-laws, minutes of general meetings
of shareholders and audited financial statements that must be presented to the annual
general meeting of shareholders. The register of shareholders of the Company also is open
to inspection by shareholders without charge, and to members of the public for a fee. The
Company is required to maintain its share register at its registered office in Bermuda.
The Company also maintains a branch register in the offices of its transfer agent in the
U.S., which is open for public inspection as required under the Companies Act. The Company
is required to keep at its registered office a register of its directors and officers that
is open for inspection by members of the public without charge. However, Bermuda law does
not provide a general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other
corporate records. Under Delaware law, any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a
corporation’s shareholder list and its other books and records for any purpose
reasonably related to that person’s interest as a shareholder.

Shareholder’s Suits.

The
rights of shareholders under Bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of
shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many U.S. jurisdictions. Class
actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws
of Bermuda. However, the Bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow English
case law precedent, which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of the
Company to remedy a wrong done to the Company where the act complained of is alleged to be
beyond the corporate power of the Company or illegal or would result in the violation of
the Company’s memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, the court would
give consideration to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority
shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the
Company’s shareholders than actually approved it. The winning party in an action of
this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys’ fees incurred in
connection with the action. Under Delaware law, class actions and derivative actions
generally are available to stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and
actions not taken in accordance with applicable law. In these types of actions, the court
has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys’ fees.

Limitation of Liability of
Directors and Officers

. The Company’s bye-laws provide that the
Company and its shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have,
individually or in the right of the Company, against any director or officer for any act
or failure to act in the performance of that director’s or officer’s duties.
However, this waiver does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud
or dishonesty. This waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under U.S.
federal securities laws. Under Delaware law, a corporation may include in its certificate
of incorporation provisions limiting the personal


liability of its directors to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty. However, these
provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or
omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, the authorization of unlawful dividends, stock repurchases or stock redemptions,
or any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit. Moreover,
these provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under U.S. federal securities
laws.

Indemnification of Directors and
Officers.

The Company’s bye-laws provide that the Company shall indemnify its
directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions, costs,
charges, liabilities, loss, damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of
any act done, concurred in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s business or in
the discharge of their duties. Under Bermuda law, this indemnification may not extend to
any matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in
relation to the Company, as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to
appeal. Under Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes
a party to an action, suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer
if (1) the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and (2) if the action or
proceeding involves a criminal offense, the director or officer had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.

The Company is organized under the laws of Bermuda. Some of its directors and officers
may reside outside the U.S. A substantial portion of the Company’s assets are or may
be located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. A person may not be able to effect service of
process within the U.S. on directors and officers of the Company and those experts who
reside outside the U.S. A person also may not be able to recover against them or the
Company on judgments of U.S. courts or to obtain original judgments against them or the
Company in Bermuda courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions
of the U.S. federal securities laws.

Dividends.

Bermuda
law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend, or make a
          distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for
          believing that the Company, after the payment is made, would be unable to pay
          its liabilities as they become due, or that the realizable value of the
          Company’s assets would be less, as a result of the payment, than the
          aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium
          accounts. The share capital account represents the aggregate par value of the
          Company’s issued shares, and the share premium account represents the
          aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value. Under
          Delaware law, subject to any restrictions contained in the Company’s
          certificate of incorporation, a company may pay dividends out of the surplus
or,           if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the
          dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Surplus is the amount by
          which the net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital. Delaware law
          also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time
when           stated capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding
stock of           all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets.

RISKS RELATING TO TAXATION

If U.S. tax law changes, the Company’s
net income may be reduced.

In the last few years, some members
of Congress have expressed concern about U.S. corporations that move their place of
incorporation to low-tax jurisdictions. Also, some members of Congress have expressed
concern over a competitive advantage that foreign-controlled insurers and reinsurers may
have over U.S. controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by
U.S. insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions, including Bermuda.
 Although the recently enacted legislation, which increases the U.S. tax burden on
so-called “inverting” companies, does not apply to the Company, the Company
does not know whether any similar legislation disadvantageous to the Company’s
Bermuda insurance subsidiaries will ever be


enacted into law. If it were enacted, the
U.S. tax burden on the Company’s Bermuda operations, or on some business ceded from its licensed
U.S. insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers, could be increased. This could
reduce the Company’s net income.

The Company and/or Bermuda Re may
be subject to U.S. corporate income tax, which would reduce the Company’s net income.

The income of Bermuda Re is a
significant portion of the Company’s worldwide income from operations. The Company
has established guidelines for the conduct of its Bermuda operations that are designed to
ensure that Bermuda Re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S.
Based on its compliance with those guidelines, the Company believes that Bermuda Re should
not be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax, other than withholding tax on U.S.
source dividend income. However, if the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
successfully contended that Bermuda Re was engaged in a trade or business in the U.S.,
Bermuda Re would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on any income that is
subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax.
Even if the IRS successfully contended that Bermuda Re was engaged in a U.S. trade or
business, the U.S.-Bermuda tax treaty would preclude the IRS from taxing Bermuda Re’s
income except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment
maintained by that subsidiary. The Company does not believe that Bermuda Re has a
permanent establishment in the U.S. If the IRS successfully contended that Bermuda Re did
have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the U.S., Bermuda Re would be
subject to U.S. tax on that income.

Based on its compliance with
guidelines designed to ensure that it generates only immaterial amounts, if any, of income
that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., the Company believes that it
should be required to pay only immaterial amounts, if any, of U.S. corporate income tax,
other than withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income. However, if the IRS
successfully contended that the Company had material amounts of income that is subject to
the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., it would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax
on that income, and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax. Prior to the current year, even
if the IRS had successfully contended that the Company had material amounts of income that
was subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., the U.S.-Barbados tax treaty would
have precluded the IRS from taxing its income, except to the extent that its income was
attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by it in the U.S. Since the Company
moved its principal executive offices out of Barbados as of December 31, 2004 and since
the United States and Barbados recently made effective a protocol to the U.S.-Barbados tax
treaty, which strengthens the limitation of benefits provisions of that treaty, the
U.S.-Barbados tax treaty will no longer provide any protection to the Company.
Nevertheless, the Company does not believe that it has material amounts of income subject
to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S. If the IRS successfully contended, however, that
the Company did have income subject to tax in the U.S. the imposition of tax on that
income would reduce the Company’s net income.

If Bermuda Re became subject to U.S.
income tax on its income or if it became subject to U.S. income tax on more than
immaterial amounts of income, its income could also be subject to the U.S. branch profits
tax. In that event, the Company and Bermuda Re would be subject to taxation at a higher
combined effective rate than if they were organized as U.S. corporations. The combined
effect of the 35% U.S. corporate income tax rate and the 30% branch profits tax rate is a
net tax rate of 54.5%. The imposition of these taxes would reduce the Company’s net
income.

The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development and the European Union are considering measures that might
increase the Company’s taxes and reduce our net income.

A number of multinational
organizations, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the
“OECD”), have recently identified some countries as not participating in
adequate information exchange, engaging in harmful tax practices or not maintaining
adequate controls to prevent


corruption, such as money laundering activities. The OECD
has threatened non-member jurisdictions that do not agree to cooperate with the OECD
with punitive sanctions by OECD member countries, though specific sanctions have yet to
be adopted by OECD member countries. It is as yet unclear as to what these sanctions will
be, who will adopt them and when or if they will be imposed. The OECD published a list of
“uncooperative tax havens,” which are those jurisdictions from whom the OECD
has not received commitments to the OECD’s principles of regulatory and tax
transparency and effective exchange of information. The government of Bermuda has made
these commitments. As a result, Bermuda is not currently listed as an uncooperative tax
haven. However, it is possible that the OECD could change its view in the future and
decide to list Bermuda as an uncooperative tax haven, or that one of the other
multinational organizations could take a different view from the OECD and decide to
recommend sanctions against Bermuda. Any sanctions imposed on Bermuda could increase the
Company’s taxes and reduce its net income. In addition, the Company is not able to
predict what changes will arise from the commitments given to the OECD by the government
of Bermuda or whether those changes will subject it to additional taxes.

The Company and/or Bermuda Re may
become subject to Bermuda tax, which would reduce the Company’s net income.

The Company and Bermuda Re currently are
not subject to income or capital gains taxes in Bermuda. Both companies have received an
assurance from the Bermuda Minister of Finance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax
Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda
that imposes any tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain
or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then that tax
will not apply to them or to any of the Company’s operations or its shares,
debentures or other obligations until March 28, 2016. This assurance does not prevent the
application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda and does not
prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land
Tax Act 1967 of Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to the Company
or Bermuda Re. There are currently no procedures for extending these assurances. As a
result, the Company and Bermuda Re could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28,
2016, which could reduce the Company’s net income.

The Company’s net income will
be reduced if U.S. excise and withholding taxes are increased.

Bermuda Re is subject to an excise
tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums it collects with respect to risks located in the
U.S. In addition, Bermuda Re may be subject to withholding tax on dividend income from
U.S. sources. These taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on
Bermuda Re’s business, which could reduce the Company’s net income.

ITEM 9A.  Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report.

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial
reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

. Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of
December 31, 2004, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.

Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report in Part IV, Item
15, “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm”.

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting

As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the
Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, has evaluated our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether
any changes occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter covered by this annual report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change
during the fourth quarter.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders

of Everest Re Group, Ltd.:

We have completed an integrated audit
of Everest Re Group, Ltd.‘s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedules

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Everest Re Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index

present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial
reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria
established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted
our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes

F-2

in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

EVEREST RE GROUP, LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. Business and Basis of
Presentation

Everest Re Group, Ltd.
(“Group”), a Bermuda company, was established in 1999 as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Everest Reinsurance Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”). On February 24,
2000, a corporate restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding
company of Holdings. Holders of shares of common stock of Holdings automatically became
holders of the same number of common shares of Group. Prior to the restructuring, Group
had no significant assets or capitalization and had not engaged in any business or prior
activities other than in connection with the restructuring. Group, through its
subsidiaries, principally provides reinsurance and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and
international markets. As used in this document, the “Company” means Group and
its subsidiaries, except when referring to periods prior to February 24, 2000, when it
means Holdings and its subsidiaries. Prior to December 31, 2004, Group’s principal
executive office was located in Barbados. On December 31, 2004 the Company effectively
closed its principal executive office in Barbados and established its principal executive
office in Bermuda.

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America. The statements include the following domestic
and foreign direct and indirect subsidiaries of Group: Holdings, Everest Reinsurance
(Bermuda), Ltd. (“Bermuda Re”), Everest International Reinsurance, Ltd.
(“Everest International”), formerly AFC Re Ltd., Mt. McKinley Insurance Company
(“Mt. McKinley”), formerly Gibraltar Casualty Company, Everest Global Services,
Inc. (“Global Services”), Everest Advisors (UK), Ltd., Everest Advisors
(Ireland) Limited, Everest Re Advisors, Ltd., Everest Reinsurance Company (“Everest
Re”), Everest National Insurance Company (“Everest National”), Everest
Indemnity Insurance Company (“Everest Indemnity”), Everest Re Holdings, Ltd.
(“Everest Ltd.”), Everest Security Insurance Company (“Everest
Security”), formerly Southeastern Security Insurance Company, Everest Insurance
Company of Canada (“Everest Canada”), Mt. McKinley Managers, L.L.C.
(“Managers”), Workcare Southeast, Inc. (“Workcare Southeast”), and
Workcare Southeast of Georgia, Inc. (“Workcare Georgia”). All amounts are
reported in U.S. dollars.

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities (and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities) at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

B. Investments

Fixed maturity
investments are all classified as available for sale. Unrealized appreciation and
depreciation, as a result of temporary changes in market value during the period, are
reflected in shareholders’equity, net of income taxes in “accumulated other
comprehensive income”. Equity securities are carried at market value with unrealized
appreciation or depreciation, as a result of temporary changes in market value during the
period, are reflected in shareholders’ equity, net of income taxes in “accumulated
other comprehensive income”. Unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity
securities, which are deemed other than temporary, are charged to net income as realized
capital losses. Short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates market
value. Realized gains or losses on sale of investments are determined on the basis of
identified cost. For non-publicly traded securities, market prices are determined through
the use of pricing models that evaluate securities relative to the U.S. Treasury yield
curve, taking into account the issue type, credit quality and cash flow characteristics
of

F-8

each security. For publicly traded
securities, market value is based on quoted market prices. Retrospective adjustments are
employed to recalculate the values of loan-backed and asset-backed securities. Each
acquisition lot is reviewed to recalculate the effective yield. The recalculated
effective yield is used to derive a book value as if the new yield were applied at the
time of acquisition. Outstanding principal factors from the time of acquisition to the
adjustment date are used to calculate the prepayment history for all applicable
securities. Conditional prepayment rates, computed with life to date factor histories and
weighted average maturities, are used to affect the calculation of projected and
prepayments for pass through security types. Other invested assets include limited
partnerships and rabbi trusts. Limited partnerships are valued pursuant to the equity
method of accounting, which management believes approximates market value. The
Supplemental Retirement Plan Rabbi Trust, the Deferred Compensation Plan Rabbi Trust and
the Supplemental Savings Plan Rabbi Trust are carried at market value. Cash includes cash
and bank time deposits with original maturities of ninety days or less.

C. Uncollectible
Receivable Balances

The Company provides reserves for
uncollectible reinsurance balances based on management’s assessment of the
collectibility of the outstanding balances. Such reserves were $37.1 million at December
31, 2004 and $33.6 million at December 31, 2003. See also Note 11.

D. Deferred Acquisition
Costs

Acquisition costs, consisting
principally of commissions and brokerage expenses and certain premium taxes and fees
associated with the Company’s reinsurance and insurance business incurred at the time
a contract or policy is issued, are deferred and amortized over the period in which the
related premiums are earned, generally one year. Deferred acquisition costs are limited to
their estimated realizable value based on the related unearned premiums, anticipated
claims and claim expenses and anticipated investment income. Deferred acquisition costs
amortized to income were $975.2 million, $863.9 million and $551.8 million in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

The present value of in force annuity
business is included in deferred acquisition costs. This value is amortized over the
expected life of the business at the time of acquisition. The amortization each year will
be a function of the gross profits each year in relation to the total gross profits
expected over the life of the business, discounted at an assumed net credit rate.

E. Reserve for Losses and
Loss Adjustment Expenses

The reserve for losses and loss
adjustment expenses (“LAE”) is based on individual case estimates and reports
received from ceding companies. A provision is included for losses and LAE incurred but
not reported (“IBNR”) based on past experience. A provision is also included for
certain potential liabilities relating to asbestos and environmental (“A&E”)
exposures, which liabilities cannot be estimated with traditional reserving techniques.
See also Note 3. The reserves are reviewed continually and any changes in estimates are
reflected in earnings in the period the adjustment is made. Management believes that
adequate provision has been made for the Company’s losses and LAE. Loss and LAE
reserves are presented gross of reinsurance receivables and incurred losses and LAE are
presented net of ceded reinsurance.

Accruals for contingent commission
liabilities are established for reinsurance contracts that provide for the stated
commission percentage to increase or decrease based on the loss experience of the
contract. Changes in the estimated liability for such arrangements are recorded as
contingent commissions. Accruals for contingent commission liabilities are determined
through the review of the contracts that have these adjustable features and are estimated
based on expected loss and LAE.

F-9

F. Future Policy Benefit
Reserve

Liabilities for future policy benefits
on annuity policies are carried at their accumulated values. Reserves for policy benefits
include both mortality and morbidity claims in the process of settlement and IBNR claims.
Interest rate assumptions used to estimate liabilities for policy benefits range from 4.0%
to 7.3%. Actual experience in a particular period may vary.

G. Premium Revenues

Written premiums are earned ratably
over the periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned
premium reserves are established to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period.
Such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies or
computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data. Written and earned premiums,
and the related costs, which have not yet been reported to the Company are estimated and
accrued. Premiums are net of ceded reinsurance.

Annuity premiums are recognized as
revenue over the premium-paying period of the policies.

H. Income Taxes

Holdings and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Foreign branches of
subsidiaries file local tax returns as required. Group and its other subsidiaries, not
included in Holdings’ consolidated tax return, file separate company U.S. federal
income tax returns, where required. The UK branch of Bermuda Re files a UK income tax
return. Deferred income taxes have been recorded to recognize the tax effect of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and
liabilities.

I. Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities relating to
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date; revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using average
exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial
statements, net of deferred income taxes, are excluded from net income and accumulated in
shareholders’ equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
are recorded through the statement of operations.

J. Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are
calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if
options granted under various stock-based compensation plans were exercised resulting in
the issuance of common shares that then shared in the earnings of the entity. See also
Note 16.

F-10

Net income per common share has been
computed below, based upon weighted average common and dilutive shares outstanding.

All options to purchase common shares
outstanding at the end of 2004 were included in the computation of earnings per diluted
share because the average market price of the common shares was greater than the
options’ exercise price at the end of 2004. Options to purchase 247,956 common shares
at prices ranging from $70.18 to $73.615 per share and 212,000 common shares at prices
ranging from $63.31 to $70.18 per share were outstanding at the end of 2003 and 2002,
respectively, but were not included in the computation of earnings per diluted share for
the respective years because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the common shares at the end of such years. All outstanding options expire
on or between October 6, 2005 and September 21, 2014.

K. Segmentation

The Company,
through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance,
Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. See also Note 18.

L. Derivatives

The Company has remaining in its
product portfolio one credit default swap, which it no longer offers, and five specialized
equity put options. These products meet the definition of a derivative under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities” (“FAS 133”). The Company’s position in these
contracts is unhedged and is accounted for as a derivative in accordance with FAS 133.
Accordingly, these contracts are carried at fair value and are recorded in “Other
liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets and changes in fair value are
recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

M. Deposit Assets and Liabilities

In the normal course of its operations, the Company may enter into contracts that do
not meet the risk transfer provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short Duration and Long Duration
Contracts”. Such contracts are accounted for using the deposit accounting method.
For such contracts, the Company originally records deposit liabilities for an amount
equivalent to the assets received. Actuarial studies are used to estimate the final
liabilities under such contracts with any change reflected in the consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive income.

N. Stock-based Employee
Compensation

Prior to 2002, the Company accounted for its stock-based employee
compensation plans (See Note 16) under the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees”, and related interpretations. Effective January 1, 2002, the
Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS
123”) prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after
January 1, 2002.

Had the compensation cost for the
Company’s stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at
the grant dates for awards prior to January 1, 2002 under those plans consistent with the
method of FAS 123, the Company’s net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

The fair value of each option grant
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions: (i) dividend yields ranging from 0.5% to 0.9%, (ii) expected
volatility ranging from 32.9% to 45.8%, (iii) risk-free interest rates ranging from a low
of 4.7% to a high of 7.0% and (iv) expected life of 7.3-7.5 years.

O. Policyholder Dividends

The
Company issues certain insurance policies with dividend payment features. These
policyholders share in the operating results of their respective policies in the form of
dividends declared. Dividends to policyholders are accrued during the period in which the
related premiums are earned and are determined based on the terms of the individual
policies.

P. Application of New Accounting
Standards

In January 2003, FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities”(“FIN 46”). FIN 46 addresses whether certain
types of entities, referred to as variable interest entities (“VIEs”), should
be consolidated or deconsolidated in a company’s financial statements. During
October 2003, the FASB deferred the effective date of FIN 46 provisions for VIEs created
prior to February 1, 2003 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003.
During December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, replacing FIN 46. FIN 46R is effective,
for entities that had not adopted FIN 46 as of December 24, 2003, no later than the end
of the first reporting period that ends on or after March 15, 2004. The Company adopted
FIN 46R in the first quarter of 2004, resulting in the deconsolidation of Everest Re
Capital Trust (“Capital Trust”) and Everest Re Capital Trust II (“Capital
Trust II”). For 2003 and 2002, where applicable, the financial statements have been
restated to reflect the deconsolidation.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issue
Task Force (“EITF”) reached a final consensus on Issue 03-1, “The Meaning
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”. This
issue establishes guidance for determining whether to record impairment losses associated
with investments in certain equity and debt securities. The application of this issue was
required for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004. On September 30, 2004, the
FASB issued a FASB Staff Position EITF Issue 03-1-1, which delayed the effective date for
the measurement and recognition guidance included in paragraphs 10 through 20 of EITF
Issue 03-1.

F-12

The Company is unable to predict the
impact on other-than-temporary impairments until the guidance is finalized. Currently,
the Company continues to apply Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“FAS 115”), and
the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)‘s Staff Accounting Bulletin
Topic 5:M, “Other Than Temporary Impairment Of Certain Investments In Debt And
Equity Securities” and believes that unrealized losses in its investment portfolio
are temporary in nature.

In December 2004, the Financial
accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Statement 123(R) “Share-Based
Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”). FAS 123(R) requires all share-based compensation
awards granted, modified or settled after December 15, 1994 to be accounted for using the
fair value method of accounting. Under the modified prospective application, compensation
cost is recognized for the outstanding, non-vested awards based on the grant date fair
value of those awards as calculated under FAS 123. The Company does not expect the
adoption of the statement to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition or results of operation. The application of this issue will become effective
for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005.

Q. Investments –Interest
Only Strips

Commencing with the second quarter of 2003 and through the second quarter
of 2004, the Company had investments in interest only strips of mortgage-backed
securities (“interest only strips”). These securities give the holder the right
to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages.
The interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally
rated AAA. The ultimate cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the
average life of the mortgage pool. Generally, as market interest rates and, more
specifically, market mortgage rates decline, mortgagees tend to refinance which will
decrease the average life of a mortgage pool and decrease expected cash flows.
Conversely, as market interest rates and, more specifically, mortgage rates rise,
repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows will tend to rise. Accordingly, the
market value of these investments tends to increase as general interest rates rise and
decline as general interest rates fall. These movements are generally counter to the
impact of interest rate movements on the Company’s other fixed income investments.
As interest rates rose during the second quarter of 2004, the Company fully liquidated
its interest only strip investment portfolio.

The Company accounted for its
investment in interest only strips in accordance with EITF No. 99-20, “Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchases and Beneficial Interests in Securitized
Financial Assets”(“EITF 99-20”). EITF 99-20 sets forth the rules for
recognizing interest income on all credit-sensitive mortgage and asset-backed securities
and certain prepayment-sensitive securities, including agency interest only strips,
whether purchased or retained in securitization, as well as the rules for determining when
these securities must be written down to fair value because of impairment. EITF 99-20
requires decreases in the valuation of residual interests in securitizations to be
recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the residual interests through a charge
to earnings, rather than an unrealized loss in shareholders’ equity, when any portion
of the decline in fair value is attributable to, as defined by EITF 99-20, an impairment
loss. This portfolio was liquidated during the second quarter of 2004. The Company
recorded realized capital losses due to impairments of $49.7 million, net of income tax
benefit of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and realized capital losses
due to impairments of $37.3 million, net of income tax benefit of $8.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. As a result of liquidating the interest only strip
investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2004, the Company recognized realized
capital gains of $91.0 million, net of income taxes of $27.2 million.

2. INVESTMENTS

The amortized cost, market value, and
gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of fixed maturity investments and equity
securities are presented in the tables below:

F-14

The amortized cost and market value
of fixed maturities are shown in the following table by contractual maturity.
Mortgage-backed securities generally are more likely to be prepaid than other fixed
maturities. As the stated maturity of such securities may not be indicative of actual
maturities, the total for mortgage-backed securities is shown separately.

Proceeds from sales of fixed maturity
investments during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $1,451.2 million, $1,219.0 million and
$2,029.1 million, respectively. Gross gains of $163.8 million, $49.9 million and $91.9
million and gross losses of $8.3 million, $16.8 million and $41.3 million were realized on
those fixed maturity sales during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Proceeds from sales
of equity security investments during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $18.0 million, $8.1 million
and $19.9 million, respectively. Gross gains of $0.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.9
million and gross losses of $0.9 million, $0.0 million and $0.3 million were realized on
those equity sales during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The changes in net unrealized gains
(losses) of investments of the Company are derived from the following sources:

The Company frequently reviews its
investment portfolio for declines in market value and focuses its attention on securities
whose fair value has fallen below 80% of their amortized value at the time of review. The
Company then assesses whether the decline in value is temporary or “other than
temporary”. In making its assessment, the Company evaluates the current market and
interest rate environment as well as specific issuer information. Generally, a change in
the market or interest rate environment does not constitute impairment but rather a
temporary decline in market value. Temporary declines in market value are recorded as an
unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income. If the Company determines that
the decline is “other than

F-15

temporary”, the carrying value
of the investment is written down to fair value and a realized loss is recorded in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The Company’s
assessments are based on the issuer’s current financial position and timeliness with
respect to interest and/or principal payments, and speed of repayments on asset-backed
securities, as well as relevant information provided by rating agencies, investment
advisors and analysts.

The table below displays the
aggregate fair value and gross unrealized depreciation, by investment category and length
of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as
of December 31, 2004:

The aggregate fair value and gross
unrealized losses related to investments in an unrealized loss position as of December 31,
2004 is $2,154.0 million and $31.3 million, respectively. The $16.6 million of unrealized
losses related to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for one year or
less are primarily comprised of highly rated government, municipal and corporate bonds and
are primarily related to the general movements in interest rates throughout the year. Of
these unrealized losses, $14.8 million are related to securities that are rated investment
grade or better by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization.

The $14.7 million of unrealized
losses related to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for one year or
more are also primarily comprised of highly rated government, municipal and corporate
bonds and generally relate to the general movements in interest rates throughout the year.
Of these unrealized losses, $13.1 million are related to securities that are rated
investment grade or better by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization.

The Company, given the size of its
investment portfolio and capital position, has the ability to hold these securities until
recovery of market value. In addition, all securities currently in an unrealized loss
position are current with respect to principal and interest payments.

F-16

The components of net investment
income are presented in the table below:

Other income for 2004, 2003 and 2002
primarily includes income (expense) on limited partnership investments of $41.8 million,
$17.5 million and $(0.6) million, respectively.

The Company has contractual
commitments to invest up to an additional $186.4 million related to its limited
partnership investments at December 31, 2004. These commitments will be funded as required
by the partnership agreements, which have investment periods that expire no later than
2011.

The components of realized capital
gains (losses) are presented in the table below:

The realized capital losses for
2004 and 2003 included $0.5 million and $25.7 million, respectively, relating to
write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary
basis and $65.1 million and $46.2 million, respectively, related to the impairment on
interest only strips in accordance with EITF 99-20. Realized capital losses for 2002
included $101.3 million relating to write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be
impaired on an other than temporary basis.

Securities with a carrying value
amount of $1,088.6 million at December 31, 2004 were on deposit with various state or
governmental insurance departments in compliance with insurance laws.

During 2001, the Company sold five
European put options based on the Standard & Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”)
index for total consideration, net of commission, of $16.9 million. These contracts each
have a single exercise date with maturities ranging from 18 to 30 years and strike prices
ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No amounts would be payable under these contracts if
the S&P 500 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise dates. If the S&P
500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount

F-17

due would vary proportionately with
the percentage the index was below the strike price. Based on historical index values and
trends, the Company estimates the probability for each contract of the S&P 500 being
below the strike price on the exercise date ranges from .43% to 6.37%. The theoretical
maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P
500 index value were zero. The present value of these theoretical maximum payouts using a
6% discount factor is $161.9 million.

Because there are no published market
values available for these long term index put options, a Black-Scholes model is used to
estimate fair value. The factors used in determining fair value are the S&P 500 index
value at the financial statement date, current interest rates matching the duration of the
puts and estimated volatility, with current market option volatility extrapolated to the
put maturities using historical data. Movements in the mark to model are reflected through
the income statement.

During 2000, the Company entered into
three credit swap derivative contracts, which provide credit default protection on a
portfolio of referenced securities. As of December 31, 2004 the Company had one remaining
credit default swap. The Company recorded net after-tax losses from these contracts of
$0.0 million, $0.0 million and $3.9 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to
reflect them at fair value. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the remaining maximum
after-tax net loss exposure under these contracts is $0.0 million and $2.9 million,
respectively.

The Company’s position in these
contracts is unhedged and is accounted for as derivatives in accordance with FAS 133.
Accordingly, these contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded
in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

F-18

3.  
          RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LAE

Activity in the reserve for losses
and LAE is summarized as follows:

Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled
$7,836.3 million at December 31, 2004, $6,361.2 million at December 31, 2003, and $4,905.6
million at December 31, 2002. The increase in 2004 is primarily attributable to increased
premiums earned, net prior period reserve adjustments in select areas, increase in
catastrophe losses and normal variability in claim settlements. The increase in 2003 was
primarily attributable to increased premiums earned, net prior period reserve adjustments
in select areas and normal variability in claim settlement.

Reinsurance receivables for both paid
and unpaid losses totaled $1,210.8 million at December 31, 2004, $1,284.1 million at
December 31, 2003, and $1,116.4 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2004, $405.0
million, or 33.4%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Reinsurance Group
(“London Life”). These receivables are effectively secured by a combination of
letters of credit and funds held arrangements under which the Company has retained the
premium payments due the retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for such amounts and
reduced such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire. In addition,
$160.0 million, or 13.2%, was receivable from Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance
Company of Indiana (“Prupac”), which in late 2003 was purchased by LM Property
and Casualty Insurance Company (“LM”) and whose obligations continue to be
guaranteed by The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“The Prudential”) and
$132.5 million, or 10.9%, was receivable from Transatlantic Reinsurance Company
(“Transatlantic”) and $100.0 million, or 8.3%, was receivable from Continental
Insurance Company (“Continental”), which is partially secured by funds held
arrangements. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s
receivables.

Prior year incurred losses increased
by $312.0 million in 2004 and $256.9 million in 2003. The increase was the result of
modest reserve strengthening in select areas, most notably in asbestos exposures,
directors and officers, surety and workers’ compensation lines.

F-19

Activity in the reserve for future
policy benefits is summarized as follows:

The Company continues to receive
claims under expired contracts, both insurance and reinsurance, asserting alleged injuries
and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous
substances, including asbestos. The Company’s asbestos claims typically involve
potential liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage
resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos. The Company’s environmental
claims typically involve potential liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of
environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property damages caused by the release
of hazardous substances into the land, air or water.

The Company’s reserves include
an estimate of the Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims. This estimate is
made based on a judgmental assessment of the underlying exposures as the result of (1)
long and variable reporting delays, both from insureds to insurance companies and from
ceding companies to reinsurers; (2) historical data, which is more limited and variable on
A&E losses than historical information on other types of casualty claims; and (3)
unique aspects of A&E exposures for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using
traditional reserving techniques. There are significant uncertainties in estimating the
amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties
are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily
injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or
environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or
liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and
judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental
claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions
concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g)
uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or
environmental exposure.

With respect to asbestos claims in
particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound
the difficulty in estimating the Company’s liability. These developments include: (a)
continued growth in the number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive
plaintiff’s bar and including claims against defendants formerly regarded as
“peripheral”; (b) a disproportionate percentage of claims filed by individuals
with no functional injury, which should have little to no financial value but that have
increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the growth in the
number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims
(including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in which companies attempt to resolve their
asbestos liabilities in a manner that is prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers
from the negotiation of bankruptcy plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a small
number of states that favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims that might
impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product
liability portion; (f) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst
procedural abuses; (g) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants,
especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some states to
address asbestos litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or the U. S.
Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation.

F-20

Management believes that these
uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for A&E and particularly
asbestos losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves
for other types of losses. Given these uncertainties; management believes that no
meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established. The Company establishes
reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law
reflect an exposure for the Company or its ceding companies.

In connection with the acquisition of
Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, Prupac, a subsidiary of
The Prudential, provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the
first $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley’s reserves as of
September 19, 2000 and The Prudential guaranteed Prupac’s obligations to Mt.
McKinley. In late 2003, Prupac was purchased by LM and all obligations of Prupac continue
to be guaranteed by The Prudential. Cessions under this reinsurance agreement exhausted
the limit available under the contract at December 31, 2003.

With respect to Mt. McKinley, where
the Company has a direct relationship with policyholders, the Company’s aggressive
litigation posture and the uncertainties inherent in the asbestos coverage and bankruptcy
litigation have provided an opportunity to actively engage in settlement negotiations with
a number of those policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities.
Those discussions are oriented towards achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that
limit Mt. McKinley’s liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. In 2004, the
Company has concluded such settlements or reached agreement in principle with several of
its high profile policyholders. The Company has currently identified 15 policyholders
based on their past claim activity and/or potential future liabilities as “High
Profile Policyholders” and its settlement efforts are generally directed at such
policyholders, in part because their exposures have developed to the point where both the
policyholder and the Company have sufficient information to be motivated to settle. The
Company believes that this active approach will ultimately result in a more cost-effective
liquidation of Mt. McKinley’s liabilities than a passive approach, although it may
also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley’s losses and cash flows.

There is less potential for similar
settlements with respect to the Company’s reinsurance asbestos claims. Ceding
companies, with their direct obligation to insureds and overall responsibility for claim
settlements, are not consistently aggressive in developing claim settlement information
and conveying this information to reinsurers, which can introduce significant and perhaps
inappropriate delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers. These
delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but also restrict the
information available to estimate the reinsurers’ ultimate exposure.

Due to the uncertainties discussed
above, the ultimate losses attributable to A&E, and particularly asbestos, may be
subject to more variability than are non-A&E reserves and such variation could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
and/or cash flows.

F-21

The following table summarizes
incurred losses with respect to A&E on both a gross and net of retrocessional basis
for the periods indicated:

At December 31, 2004, the gross
reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $148.5 million representing case reserves
reported by ceding companies, $151.3 million representing additional case reserves
established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $272.1 million representing case
reserves established by the Company on direct excess insurance claims, including Mt.
McKinley and $156.4 million representing IBNR reserves.

4. CREDIT LINE

Effective December 8, 2004, Group,
Bermuda Re, and Everest International entered into a new three year, $750 million senior
credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (“Group Credit Facility”).
Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility. The Group
Credit Facility consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $250 million of
revolving credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of
standby letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the option of
each of the borrowers, be either (1) Base Rate Loans (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted
London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin. The Base Rate is the
higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime
rate or the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and
the fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depend on Group’s senior unsecured
debt rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500 million for the issuance of
standby letters of credit on a collateralized basis.

The Group Credit Facility
requires Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to
maintain a minimum net worth amount. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of
(i) $2,373 million (base amount) plus (ii) (A) 25% of consolidated net income for each of
Group’s fiscal quarters and (B) 50% of any increase in consolidated net worth
attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. The base amount
is reset at the end of each fiscal year to be the greater of 70% of Group's consolidated
net worth as of the last day of the fiscal year and the calculated minimum amount
of net worth prior to the last day of the fiscal year. As of December 31, 2004,
the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

For the year ended December 31,
2004, there were no borrowings under tranche one of the Group Credit Facility. During
the year ended December 31, 2004, there was $66.0 million used of the $500 million
available for tranche two standby letters of credit. See Note 7.

Effective October 10, 2003, Holdings
entered into a new three year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of lenders, replacing the December 21, 1999, three year senior revolving credit
facility,

F-22

which expired on December 19, 2003.
Both the October 10, 2003 and December 21, 1999 senior revolving credit agreements, which
have similar terms, are referred to as “Holdings Credit Facility”. Wachovia
Bank is the administrative agent for the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility
is used for liquidity and general corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides
for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings
equal to either, (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted LIBOR plus a
margin. The Base Rate is the higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank
from time to time as its prime rate or the Federal Funds rate in each case plus 0.5% per
annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends
upon Holdings’ senior unsecured debt rating.

The Holdings Credit Facility
requires Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1,
Holdings to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1 and Everest Re to
maintain its statutory surplus at $1.0 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and
25% of future aggregate capital contributions. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants.

During the year ended December 31,
2004, there were payments made of $70.0 million and there were no incremental borrowings made
under the Holdings Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2003, there were no
payments made and no incremental borrowings under the Holdings Credit Facility. During the
year ended December 31, 2002, there were payments made of $80 million and new Holdings
Credit Facility borrowings of $45 million. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were
outstanding Holdings Credit Facility borrowings of $0.0 million and $70.0 million,
respectively. Interest expense incurred in connection with these borrowings was $1.2
million, $1.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

5. SENIOR NOTES

On October 12, 2004, Holdings
completed a public offering of $250.0 million principal amount of 5.40% senior notes due
October 15, 2014. On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed public offerings of $200.0 million
principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15, 2010 and $250.0 million principal
amount of 8.50% senior notes due March 15, 2005. Interest expense incurred in connection
with these senior notes was $42.0 million, $38.9 million and $38.9 million for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Market value, which is based on
quoted market price at December 31, 2004 was $250.3 million for the 5.4% senior notes,
$236.7 million for the 8.75% senior notes and $252.7 million for the 8.5% senior notes.

6. JUNIOR SUBORDINATED
DEBT SECURITIES PAYABLE

On March 29, 2004, Holdings issued
$329.9 million of 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities due March 29, 2034 to Capital
Trust II. Holdings can redeem the junior subordinated debt securities before their
maturity at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest as of the date of
redemption, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions at any time on or after March
30, 2009; or at any time, in whole, but not in part, within 90 days of the occurrence and
continuation of specific events.

On November 14, 2002, Holdings issued
$216.5 million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities due November 15, 2032 to
Capital Trust. Holdings can redeem the junior subordinated debt securities before their
maturity at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest as of the date of
redemption, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions at any time on or after November
14, 2007; or at any time, in whole, but not in part, within 90 days of the occurrence and
continuation of specific events.

Fair value, which is primarily based
on quoted market price of the related trust preferred securities at December, 31 2004 was
$238.8 million for the 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities and $309.9 million for
the 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities.

F-23

Interest expense incurred in
connection with these junior subordinated notes was $32.4 million, $17.0 million and $2.2
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Capital Trust and Capital Trust II
are wholly owned finance subsidiaries of Holdings.

Holdings considers that the
mechanisms and obligations relating to the trust preferred securities, taken together,
constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by Holdings of Capital Trust and Capital
Trust II’s payment obligations with respect to their respective trust preferred
securities.

There are certain regulatory and
contractual restrictions on the ability of Holdings’ operating subsidiaries to
transfer funds to Holdings in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The insurance
laws of the State of Delaware, where Holdings’ direct insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled, require regulatory approval before those subsidiaries can pay dividends or make
loans or advances to Holdings that exceed certain statutory thresholds. In addition, the
terms of Holdings’ Credit Facility require Everest Re, Holdings’ principal
insurance subsidiary, to maintain a certain statutory surplus level as measured at the end
of each fiscal year. At December 31, 2004, $1,901.0 million of the $2,565.0 million in net
assets of Holdings’ consolidated subsidiaries were subject to the foregoing
regulatory restrictions.

7. LETTERS OF CREDIT

The Company has arrangements
available for the issuance of letters of credit, which letters are generally
collateralized by the Company’s cash and investments. Citibank is a bilateral
agreement, while the Wachovia Syndicated Facility is a syndicate of lenders (see Note 4,
tranche two of the Group Credit Facility), with Wachovia acting as administrative
agent. Under similar arrangements, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, letters of credit for
$350.9 million and $246.2 million, respectively, were issued and outstanding, generally
supporting reinsurance provided by the Company’s non-U.S. operations. The following
table summarizes the Company’s letters of credit as of December 31, 2004. All dollar
amounts are in thousands.

F-24

8. TRUST AGREEMENTS

Certain subsidiaries of the Company,
principally Bermuda Re, a Bermuda insurance company and direct subsidiary of Group, have
established trust agreements as security for assumed losses payable of certain
non-affiliated ceding companies, which effectively use Company investments as collateral.
At December 31, 2004, the total amount on deposit in trust accounts was $188.9 million.

9. OPERATING LEASE
AGREEMENTS

The future minimum rental
commitments, exclusive of cost escalation clauses, at December 31, 2004 for all of the
Company’s operating leases with remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year
are as follows:

expense, net of sublease rental income, was $7.6 million, $6.8 million and $6.7 million
for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

10. INCOME TAXES

Under current Bermuda law, no income
or capital gains taxes are imposed on Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries. The Minister of
Finance of Bermuda has also assured Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries that, pursuant to
The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966, they will be exempt until 2016 from
any such taxes imposed in the future. No tax is imposed on capital gains. Through 2004,
Group was registered in Barbados as an external company and licensed as an international
business company. This provided Group with certain tax benefits, including a preferred
rate of corporation tax on profits and gains in Barbados and exemption from withholding
tax on dividend payments.

F-25

All the income of the U.S.
subsidiaries is subject to the applicable federal, foreign, state and local taxes on
corporations. Additionally, the income of foreign branches of the Company’s insurance
operating companies, in particular the UK branch of Bermuda Re, is subject to various
income taxes. The provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of income has
been determined by reference to the individual income of each entity and the respective
applicable tax laws. It reflects the permanent differences between financial and taxable
income relevant to each entity. The significant components of the provision are as
follows:

The weighted average expected tax
provision has been calculated using the pre-tax income (loss) in each jurisdiction
multiplied by that jurisdiction’s applicable statutory tax rate. Reconciliation of
the difference between the provision for income taxes and the expected tax provision at
the weighted average tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is provided
below:

F-26

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax
effect of the temporary differences between the value of assets and liabilities for
financial statement purposes and such values as measured by the UK and U.S. tax laws and
regulations. The principal items making up the net deferred income tax asset are as
follows:

Management believes that it is more
likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets
and, accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded for the periods presented.

Tax benefits of $8.4 million and $3.5
million related to compensation expense deductions for stock options exercised in 2004 and
2003, respectively, are reflected in the change in shareholders’ equity in
“additional paid in capital”.

11. REINSURANCE

The Company utilizes reinsurance
agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. These
agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and LAE under
certain circumstances without relieving the insurer of its obligation to the policyholder.
Losses and LAE incurred and premiums earned are after deduction for reinsurance. In the
event reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under reinsurance agreements, the
Company would not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable
balances. The Company may hold partial collateral, including letters of credit and funds
held, under these agreements. See also Note 1C.

The Company considers purchasing
corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of
exposures. Such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the
availability of cost-effective retrocessional protection. For years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss
retrocession coverage that provided up to $175.0 million of coverage for each year. These
excess of loss policies provided coverage if Everest Re’s consolidated statutory
basis accident

F-27

year loss ratio exceeded a loss
ratio attachment point for each year of coverage. The attachment point was net of inuring
reinsurance and included adjustable premium provisions that effectively caused the
Company to offset, on a pre-tax income basis up to approximately 57% of such ceded
losses. The maximum recovery for each year is $175.0 million before giving effect to the
adjustable premium. During 2002 and 2003, the Company ceded $90.0 million and $85.0
million of losses, respectively, to the 2000 cover, effectively reducing the limit
available under the contract to $0.0 million. During 2002, the Company ceded $11.0
million of losses to the 2001 cover, reducing the limit available under the contract to
$0.0 million. The Company did not purchase similar coverage subsequent to December 31,
2001.

In addition, the Company had coverage
under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by Prupac, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Prudential, in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Mt.
McKinley in September 2000. This agreement covers 80% or $160 million of the first $200
million of any adverse loss reserve development on the carried reserves of Mt. McKinley at
the date of acquisition and reimburses the Company as such losses are paid by the Company.
There were $160.0 million of cessions under this reinsurance at December 31, 2003,
reducing the limit available under the contract to $0.0 million. On October 31, 2003, LM
completed its purchase of Prupac and its obligations from The Prudential. The Prudential
continues to guarantee LM’s obligation under this agreement.

Premiums written and earned are
comprised of the following:

The amounts deducted from losses and
LAE incurred for net reinsurance recoveries were $141.0 million, $278.4 million and $287.7
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company
carried as an asset $1,210.8 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses
ceded. Of this amount, $405.0 million, or 33.4%, was receivable from subsidiaries of
London Life, $160.0 million, or 13.2%, was receivable from LM, $132.5 million, or 10.9%,
was receivable from Transatlantic, and $100.0 million, or 8.3%, was receivable from
Continental. As of December 31, 2003, the Company carried an asset $1,284.1 million in
reinsurance receivables with respect to losses ceded. Of this amount, $494.5 million, or
38.5%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Life, $160.0 million, or 12.5%, was
receivable from LM, $145.0 million, or 11.3%, was receivable from Continental and $96.7
million, or 7.5%, was receivable from Transatlantic. No other retrocessionaire accounted
for more than 5% of the Company’s receivables.

The Company’s arrangements with
London Life and Continental are managed on a funds held basis, which means that the
Company has not released premium payments to the retrocessionaire but rather retains such

F-28

payments to secure obligations of
the retrocessionaire, records them as a liability, credits interest on the balances
at a stated contractual rate and
reduces the liability account as payments become due. As of December 31, 2004, such
funds had reduced the Company’s net exposure to London Life to $184.1 million,
effectively 100% of which has been secured by letters of credit, and its exposure to
Continental to $43.7 million. As of December 31, 2003, such funds had reduced the
Company’s net exposure to London Life to $204.9 million, effectively 100% of which
had been secured by letters of credit, and its exposure to Continental to $53.3 million.
LM’s obligations are guaranteed by The Prudential.

The components of comprehensive
income for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are shown in the following
table:

F-29

The following table shows the
components of the change in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

A. Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company maintains both qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans
for its U.S. employees. Generally, the Company computes the benefits based on average
earnings over a period prescribed by the plans and credited length of service. The Company’s
non-qualified defined benefit pension plan, effected in October 1995, provides
compensating pension benefits for participants whose benefits have been curtailed under
the qualified plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations.

Although not required to make
contributions under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, the Company contributed $3.3
million and $1.5 million to the qualified and non-qualified plans, respectively, in 2004
and $7.7 million and $1.2 million to the qualified and non-qualified plans, respectively,
in 2003. Pension expense for the Company’s plans for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 were $4.8 million, $3.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively.

F-30

The following table summarizes the
status of these plans for the periods indicated:

Plan assets are comprised of shares
in investment trusts with approximately 68% and approximately 32% of the underlying assets
consisting of equity securities and fixed maturities, respectively.

Net periodic pension cost included
the following components for the periods indicated:

The weighted average discount rates
used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for
2004, 2003 and 2002 were 5.75%, 6.0% and 6.75%, respectively. The rate of compensation
increase used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation
for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 4.50%. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 9.0%.

F-31

Amounts recognized in the statement
of financial position consist of for the periods indicated:

The Company also maintains both
qualified and non-qualified defined contribution plans (“Savings Plan” and
“Non-Qualified Savings Plan”, respectively) covering U.S. employees. Under the
plans, the Company contributes up to a maximum 3% of the participants’ compensation
based on the contribution percentage of the employee. The Non-Qualified Savings Plan
provides compensating savings plan benefits for participants whose benefits have been
curtailed under the Savings Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations. The
Company’s incurred expenses related to these plans were $1.0 million, $0.8 million
and $0.7 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In addition, the Company maintains
several defined contribution pension plans covering non-U.S. employees. Each non-U.S.
office (Canada, London, Belgium, Singapore and Bermuda) maintains a separate plan for the
non-U.S. employees working in that location. The Company contributes various amounts based
on salary, age, and/or years of service. The contributions as a percentage of salary for
the branch offices range from 2% to 10%. The contributions are generally used to purchase
pension benefits from local insurance providers. The Company’s incurred expenses
related to these plans were $0.4 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

The following table summarizes the
Accumulated Benefit Obligation for years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

The Company engages a third party
investment administrator to manage the qualified and non-qualified plan for its U.S.
employees. The assets in both plans consist of debt and equity mutual funds. Due to the
long term nature of the plans, the target asset allocation for each plan consists of 68%
equities and 32% bonds.

The Company expects to contribute
approximately $3.5 million and $1.3 million in 2005 to the qualified and non-qualified
plan, respectively.

B. Post-retirement Plan

Beginning
January 1, 2002, the Company established the Retiree Health Plan. This plan provides
health care benefits for eligible retired employees (and their eligible dependants), who
have elected coverage. The Company currently anticipates that most covered employees will
become eligible for these benefits if they retire while working for the Company. The cost
of these benefits is shared with the retiree. The Company accrues the postretirement
benefit expense during the period of the employee’s service.

A health care inflation rate for
pre-medicare claims of 11% in 2004 was assumed to change to 10% in 2005; and then decrease
one percentage point annually to 5% in 2010, and then remain at that level.

A health care inflation rate for
post-medicare claims of 7% in 2004, was assumed to change to 6% in 2005; and then decrease
one percentage point annually to 5% in 2006, and then remain at that level.

Changes in the assumed health care
cost trend can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
plans. A one percent change in the rate would have the following effects on:

14. DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS
AND STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

A. Dividend Restrictions

Under
Bermuda law, Group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment
would reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate
value of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium (additional
paid-in capital) accounts. Group’s ability to pay dividends and its operating
expenses is dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends
by insurer subsidiaries is limited under Bermuda law and the laws of the various U.S.
states in which Group’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or
deemed domiciled. The limitations are generally based upon net income and compliance with
applicable policyholders’ surplus or minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio
requirements as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory accounting
practices.

F-34

Under Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is
prohibited from declaring or making payment of a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum
solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is also
unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless, after
payment of the dividend, the value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as
certified by its approved actuary, exceeds its liabilities for long-term business by at
least the $250,000 minimum solvency margin. Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary
Authority is required if Bermuda Re’s dividend payments would reduce its prior
year-end total statutory capital by 15.0% or more.

Delaware law provides that an
insurance company which is a member of an insurance holding company system and is
domiciled in the state shall not pay dividends without giving prior notice to the
Insurance Commissioner of Delaware and may not pay dividends without the approval of the
Insurance Commissioner if the value of the proposed dividend, together with all other
dividends and distributions made in the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of
(1) 10% of statutory surplus or (2) net income, not including realized capital gains, each
as reported in the prior year’s statutory annual statement. In addition, no dividend
may be paid in excess of unassigned earned surplus. At December 31, 2004, Everest Re had
$209.3 million available for payment of dividends in 2005 without prior regulatory
approval.

B. Statutory Financial
Information

Everest Re prepares its statutory
financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) and the Delaware
Insurance Department. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in the NAIC
Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. The capital and statutory surplus of Everest
Re was $2,093.2 million (unaudited) and $1,715.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The statutory net income of Everest Re was $175.8 million (unaudited),
$164.6 million and $77.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Bermuda Re prepares its statutory
financial statements in conformity with the accounting principles set forth in Bermuda in
The Insurance Act 1978, amendments thereto and related regulations. The statutory capital
and surplus of Bermuda Re was $1,471.2 million (unaudited) and $1,222.3 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The statutory net income of Bermuda Re was
$241.6 million (unaudited), $128.9 million and $67.5 million for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 respectively.

15. CONTINGENCIES

The Company does not believe that
there are any material pending legal proceedings to which it or any of its subsidiaries is
a party or of which any of their properties are subject.

In the ordinary course of business,
the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute
resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the Company’s rights and
obligations under insurance, reinsurance and other contractual agreements. In some
disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds
owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others to collect
funds or enforce alleged rights. Such disputes are resolved through formal and informal
means, including litigation and arbitration. In all such matters, the Company
believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. However, there can be no assurances that adverse resolutions of such matters in any one
period or in the aggregate will not result in a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations.

In 1993 and prior, the Company had a
business arrangement with The Prudential wherein, for a fee, the Company accepted settled
claim payment obligations of certain property and casualty insurers, and, concurrently,
became the owner of the annuity or assignee of the annuity proceeds funded by the
property and casualty insurers specifically to fulfill these fully settled obligations.
In these circumstances, the Company would be liable if The

F-35

Prudential, which has an A+
(Superior) financial strength rating from A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), were
unable to make the annuity payments. The estimated cost to replace all such annuities for
which the Company was contingently liable at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $156.0
million and $153.8 million, respectively.

Prior to its 1995 initial public
offering, the Company had purchased annuities from an unaffiliated life insurance company
with an A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from A.M. Best to settle certain claim
liabilities of the Company. Should the life insurance company become unable to make the
annuity payments, the Company would be liable for those claim liabilities. The estimated
cost to replace such annuities at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $17.4 million and $16.0
million respectively.

16. STOCK BASED
COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company has a 2002 Stock
Incentive Plan (“2002 Employee Plan”), a 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (“1995
Employee Plan”), a 2003 Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Plan (“2003
Director Plan”), a 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (“1995
Director Plan”) and has awarded options to non-employee directors in Board actions in
2001, 2000 and 1999. In 2002 the Company implemented FAS No. 123, and related
interpretations in accounting for these plans and Board actions. Accordingly, option
compensation expense of $3.3 million, $2.0 million and $0.6 million have been recognized
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively, for stock options granted under the 2002 Employee Plan, the
1995 Employee Plan, the 2003 Director Plan and the 1995 Director Plan.

A summary of the status of the
Company’s shareholder approved and non-approved plans as of December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 and changes during the years then ended is presented in the following table:

Compensation Plans
Approved by Shareholders:

F-36

Under the 2003 Director Plan, 500,000
common shares have been authorized to be granted as stock options or stock awards to
non-employee directors of the Company. At December 31, 2004, there were 487,500 remaining
shares available to be granted under the 2003 Director Plan. Under the 2002, Employee Plan
4,000,000 common shares have been authorized to be granted as stock options, stock awards
or restricted stock awards to officers and key employees of the Company. At December 31,
2004, there were 2,731,350 remaining shares available to be granted under the 2002
Employee Plan. Under the 1995 Director Plan, a total of 50,000 common shares have been
authorized to be granted as stock options to non-employee directors of the Company. At
December 31, 2004, there were 37,439 remaining shares available to be granted under the
1995 Director Plan. The 2002 Employee Plan replaced the 1995 Employee Plan; therefore, no
further awards will be granted under the 1995 Employee Plan.

Compensation Plans Not
Approved by Shareholders:

Compensation plans not approved by
shareholders refer to Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999, which awarded options to
non-employee directors. The Board actions were designed to award non-employee directors
with the options to purchase common stock to increase the ownership interest in the
Company of non-employee directors whose services are considered essential to the
Company’s continued progress, to align such interests with those of the shareholders
of the Company and to provide them with a further incentive to serve as directors to the
Company. Under Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999 a total of 40,000, 30,000 and 26,000
common shares have been granted as stock options to non-employee directors of the Company.

Options granted under the 2002
Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at 20% per year over five years, options
granted under the 1995 Director Plan vest at 50% per year over two years and options
granted under the 2003 Director Plan and the 2001, 2000 and 1999 Board actions vest at 33%
per year over three years. All options are exercisable at fair market value of the stock
at the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. Restricted shares
granted under the 2002 Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at 20% per year over
five years.

F-37

The following table summarizes
information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2004:

In addition to the 2002 Employee
Plan, the 1995 Employee Plan, the 2003 Director Plan and the 1995 Director Plan, Group
issued 2,283 common shares in 2004, 1,312 common shares in 2003 and 2,248 common shares in
2002 to the Company’s non-employee directors as compensation for their service as
directors in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These issuances had aggregate values of
$185,000, $100,000 and $145,000, respectively.

Since its 1995 initial public
offering, the Company has issued to certain key employees of the Company 181,500
restricted shares of stock, of which 19,960 restricted shares have been cancelled. Upon
issuance of restricted shares, unearned compensation is charged to shareholders’
equity for the cost of the restricted stock and is amortized over the vesting period. The
amount of earned compensation recognized as expense with respect to restricted stock
awards was $1,316,224, $382,835 and $41,708 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
Company acquired 5,100; 563 and 488 common shares at a cost of $380,809, $42,449 and
$26,882 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, from employees who chose to pay required
withholding taxes with shares exercised under the stock option grants or restricted
shares, which became unrestricted. The Company acquired 604 common shares at a cost of
$49,999 in 2003 from a non-employee director who chose to pay the option exercise price
with shares. Also in 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded contributions of paid in
capital in the amount of $8.4 million, $3.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively,
representing the tax benefits attributable to the difference between the amount of
compensation expense deductible for tax purposes with respect to the stock awards and the
amount of such compensation expense reflected in the Company’s financial statements.

17. RELATED-PARTY
TRANSACTIONS

During the normal course of business,
the Company, through its affiliates, engages in reinsurance and brokerage and commission
business transactions, which management believes to be at arm’s-length, with
companies controlled by or affiliated with its outside directors. Such transactions,
individually and in the aggregate, are not material to the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

18. SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property
and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance
brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance
operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent
relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting
operation writes accident and health (“A&H”), marine, aviation and surety
business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies.
The International operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest
Re’s branches in Canada and Singapore, in addition to foreign business written
through Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation provides
reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to
life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office
and reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, including with
respect to capital, investments and support operations. As a result, management monitors
and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their
underwriting gain (loss) or underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned
premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other
underwriting expenses. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance, but such
reinsurance generally does not impact segment results, as business is generally reported
within the segment in which the business was first produced. The accounting policies of
the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1K, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies.

The Company does not maintain
separate balance sheet data for its operating segments. Accordingly, the Company does not
review and evaluate the financial results of its operating segments based upon balance
sheet data.

Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re
sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re, a Bermuda insurance company and direct
subsidiary of Group. Business for this branch was previously included in the International
segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to the sale and in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information” (“FAS 131”), the Company restated
the International and Bermuda segments for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 to
conform to December 31, 2004 segment reporting.

The following tables present the
relevant underwriting results for the operating segments for the three years ended
December 31:
