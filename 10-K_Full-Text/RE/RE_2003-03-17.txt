ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

THE COMPANY
Group, a Bermuda company,  with its principal executive office in Barbados,  was
established  in 1999 as a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Holdings.  On February 24,
2000, a corporate  restructuring  was  completed and Group became the new parent
holding company of Holdings, which remains the holding company for the Company's
U.S.  based   operations.   Holders  of  shares  of  common  stock  of  Holdings
automatically became holders of the same number of common shares of Group. Prior
to the restructuring,  Group had no significant assets or capitalization and had
not engaged in any business or prior  activities  other than in connection  with
the  restructuring.  The Company had gross premiums  written in 2002 of $2,846.5
million and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2002 of $2,368.6 million.

In  connection  with  the  restructuring,   Group  established  a  Bermuda-based
reinsurance  subsidiary,  Everest  Reinsurance  (Bermuda),  Ltd. ("Bermuda Re"),
which commenced  business in the second half of 2000.  Group also formed Everest
Global Services,  Inc., a Delaware  subsidiary,  to perform  administrative  and
back-office   functions  for  Group  and  its  U.S.-based  and  non-U.S.   based
subsidiaries.

Holdings, a Delaware corporation, was established in 1993 to serve as the parent
holding company of Everest Re, a Delaware property and casualty reinsurer formed
in 1973. Until October 6, 1995, Holdings was an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of The Prudential Insurance Company of America ("The Prudential"). On October 6,
1995, The Prudential  sold its entire  interest in the shares of common stock of
Holdings in an initial public offering (the "IPO").

The Company's principal business,  conducted through its operating subsidiaries,
is the  underwriting of reinsurance and insurance in the United States,  Bermuda
and  international  markets.  The Company  underwrites  reinsurance both through
brokers and directly with ceding companies,  giving it the flexibility to pursue
business  regardless of the ceding company's  preferred  reinsurance  purchasing
method.  The Company  underwrites  insurance  principally  through general agent
relationships  and  surplus  lines  brokers.   Group's  operating  subsidiaries,
excluding  Mt.  McKinley   Insurance   Company  ("Mt.   McKinley")  and  Everest
International  Reinsurance,  Ltd. ("Everest  International"),  are each rated A+
("Superior")  by A.M.  Best Company  ("A.M.  Best"),  an  independent  insurance
industry  rating  organization  that  rates  insurance  companies  on factors of
concern to policyholders.


Following is a summary of the Company's operating subsidiaries:

o        Everest Re, a Delaware  insurance  company  and  a direct subsidiary of
         Holdings, is a licensed property and casualty  insurer and/or reinsurer
         in all states (except Nevada and Wyoming), the  District  of  Columbia,
         Puerto Rico and is authorized to conduct reinsurance  business  in  the
         United Kingdom, Canada and Singapore. Everest Re  underwrites  property
         and casualty reinsurance for insurance and reinsurance companies in the
         United States and  international  markets.  Everest  Re  had  statutory
         surplus at December 31, 2002 of $1,494.0 million.

o        Bermuda Re, a Bermuda  insurance  company  and  a  direct subsidiary of
         Group, is registered in Bermuda  as  a  Class 4 insurer  and  long-term
         insurer and is authorized to write property  and  casualty business and
         life and annuity business. Bermuda Re commenced business  in the second
         half of 2000. In December 2000, Bermuda Re acquired all  of  the issued
         and outstanding shares of AFC Re Ltd. ("AFC Re"), a  Bermuda  long-term
         insurance company. AFC Re wrote  annuity  reinsurance  business,  which
         business has been assumed by Bermuda Re.  In September 2001, AFC Re was
         sold  to  Group  and  renamed  Everest  International and  is currently
         inactive. Bermuda Re had capital at December 31, 2002 of $931.9 million
         based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

o        Everest National Insurance Company  ("Everest  National"),  an  Arizona
         insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Everest Re, is licensed in
         45  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia and is authorized to write
         property and casualty insurance in the  jurisdictions  in  which  it is
         licensed. This is often called writing insurance on an admitted basis.

o        Everest Indemnity Insurance Company ("Everest Indemnity"),  a  Delaware
         insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Everest Re, engages in the
         excess  and  surplus  lines  insurance  business  in the United States.
         Excess and surplus lines insurance is specialty property and  liability
         coverage  that  an  insurer  not  licensed  to  write  insurance  in  a
         particular  jurisdiction  is  permitted to provide to insureds when the
         specific specialty coverage is unavailable from admitted insurers. This
         is often called writing  insurance  on  a  non-admitted basis.  Everest
         Indemnity is licensed in Delaware and is eligible to write business  on
         a non-admitted basis in 48 states, the District of Columbia and  Puerto
         Rico.

o        Everest  Security  Insurance  Company  ("Everest  Security"),  formerly
         Southeastern Security Insurance Company, a  Georgia  insurance  company
         and a direct subsidiary of Everest Re, was acquired in January 2000 and
         writes property and casualty insurance on  an admitted basis in Georgia
         and Alabama.

o        Mt.  McKinley  Managers,  L.L.C.  ("Managers"),  a  New  Jersey limited
         liability company and a direct subsidiary of Holdings, is  licensed  in
         New Jersey as an insurance  producer.  An  insurance  producer  is  any
         intermediary, such as an agent  or  broker,  which  acts as the conduit
         between an  insurance  company  and  an  insured.  Managers,  which  is
         licensed to act  in  New  Jersey as an insurance producer in connection
         with policies written on both  an admitted and a non-admitted basis, is
         the underwriting manager for  Everest  Indemnity.  Managers is also the
         parent company for  WorkCare  Southeast,  Inc.,  an  Alabama  insurance
         agency,  and  WorkCare  Southeast of Georgia, Inc., a Georgia insurance
         agency.


o        Mt.  McKinley  (f/k/a  Gibraltar  Casualty  Company, "Gibraltar") ("Mt.
         McKinley"), a Delaware insurance company and  a  direct  subsidiary  of
         Holdings,  was  acquired   by  Holdings  in  September  2000  from  The
         Prudential. Mt. McKinley was  formed by Everest Re in 1978 to engage in
         the excess and surplus lines  insurance  business in the United States.
         In 1985, Mt. McKinley ceased writing new  and renewal insurance and now
         its ongoing operations relate to  servicing  claims  arising  from  its
         previously written business.  Mt. McKinley was a  subsidiary of Everest
         Re until 1991 when Everest Re distributed the stock of  Mt. McKinley to
         a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential.

o        Everest Re Holdings,  Ltd.  ("Everest  Ltd."), a Bermuda company and  a
         direct  subsidiary of Everest Re,  was formed in 1998 and owned Everest
         Re Ltd.,  a  United  Kingdom  company  that  was  dissolved  after  its
         reinsurance operations were converted into branch operations of Everest
         Re.  Everest Ltd.  holds $79.4 million of  investments,  the management
         of which constitutes its principal operations.

REINSURANCE INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Reinsurance  is an  arrangement  in which an insurance  company,  the reinsurer,
agrees to indemnify another insurance company,  the ceding company,  against all
or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one
or more  insurance  contracts.  Reinsurance  can provide a ceding  company  with
several  benefits,  including a reduction  in net  liability  on  individual  or
classes  of risks,  catastrophe  protection  from large or  multiple  losses and
assistance in maintaining acceptable financial ratios. Reinsurance also provides
a ceding  company with  additional  underwriting  capacity by  permitting  it to
accept  larger risks and write more  business  than would be possible  without a
concomitant  increase in capital and  surplus.  Reinsurance,  however,  does not
discharge the ceding company from its liability to policyholders.

There are two basic types of reinsurance  arrangements:  treaty and  facultative
reinsurance. In treaty reinsurance,  the ceding company is obligated to cede and
the  reinsurer is obligated to assume a specified  portion of a type or category
of risks insured by the ceding  company.  Treaty  reinsurers  do not  separately
evaluate  each  of the  individual  risks  assumed  under  their  treaties  and,
consequently, after a review of the ceding company's underwriting practices, are
largely dependent on the original risk underwriting decisions made by the ceding
company. In facultative reinsurance,  the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer
assumes all or part of the risk under a single insurance  contract.  Facultative
reinsurance  is  negotiated  separately  for  each  insurance  contract  that is
reinsured. Facultative reinsurance normally is purchased by ceding companies for
individual  risks not  covered by their  reinsurance  treaties,  for  amounts in
excess of the dollar limits of their reinsurance treaties and for unusual risks.

Both  treaty  and  facultative  reinsurance  can be written on either a pro rata
basis or an excess of loss basis. Under pro rata reinsurance, the ceding company
and the  reinsurer  share the  premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an
agreed proportion.  Under excess of loss reinsurance,  the reinsurer indemnifies
the ceding company against all or a specified  portion of losses and expenses in
excess of a specified dollar amount,  known as the ceding company's retention or
reinsurer's  attachment  point,  generally  subject to a negotiated  reinsurance
contract limit.

Premiums  paid  by  the  ceding  company  to a  reinsurer  for  excess  of  loss
reinsurance  are not  directly  proportional  to the  premiums  that the  ceding
company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate  risk. In
pro rata reinsurance,  the reinsurer  generally pays the ceding company a ceding
commission.  The ceding  commission  generally is based on the ceding  company's
cost of acquiring the business  being  reinsured  (commissions,  premium  taxes,
assessments  and  miscellaneous  administrative  expense).  There is  usually no
ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance.


Reinsurers   may  purchase   reinsurance  to  cover  their  own  risk  exposure.
Reinsurance  of a  reinsurer's  business is called a  retrocession.  Reinsurance
companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers,  known
as  retrocessionaires,  for  reasons  similar to those that  cause  insurers  to
purchase reinsurance: to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks,
protect  against  catastrophic  losses,  stabilize  financial  ratios and obtain
additional underwriting capacity.

Reinsurance can be written through professional  reinsurance brokers or directly
with ceding  companies.  From a ceding  company's  perspective,  both the broker
market  and the  direct  market  have  advantages  and  disadvantages.  A ceding
company's decision to select one market over the other will be influenced by its
perception of such  advantages  and  disadvantages  relative to the  reinsurance
coverage being placed.

BUSINESS STRATEGY
The  Company's  underwriting  strategies  seek to  capitalize  on its  financial
capacity,  its employee expertise and its flexibility to offer multiple products
through  multiple  distribution   channels.  The  Company's  strategies  include
effective  management  of the property and casualty  underwriting  cycle,  which
refers to the  tendency of  insurance  premiums,  profits and the demand for and
availability  of coverage to rise and fall over time.  The Company also seeks to
manage its catastrophe  exposures and retrocessional  costs.  Efforts to control
expenses and to operate in a  cost-efficient  manner are also a continuing focus
for the Company.

The  Company's  products  include:  (1) the full range of property  and casualty
reinsurance and insurance coverages,  including marine, aviation, surety, errors
and omissions  liability  ("E&O"),  directors' and officers'  liability ("D&O"),
medical  malpractice,  other  specialty  lines,  accident  and  health  ("A&H"),
workers'  compensation and other standard lines; and (2) reinsurance of life and
annuity business.  The Company's  distribution  channels include both the direct
and  broker  reinsurance  markets,  U.S.,  Bermuda  and  international  markets,
reinsurance,  both treaty and  facultative,  and  insurance,  both  admitted and
non-admitted.

The Company's underwriting strategy emphasizes underwriting profitability rather
than  premium  volume,  writing  specialized  property  and  casualty  risks and
integration  of  underwriting  expertise  across  all  underwriting  units.  Key
elements  of this  strategy  are prudent  risk  selection,  appropriate  pricing
through  strict  underwriting   discipline  and  continuous  adjustment  of  the
Company's  business mix to respond to changing  market  conditions.  The Company
focuses on reinsuring  companies that effectively  manage the underwriting cycle
through proper analysis and pricing of underlying  risks and whose  underwriting
guidelines and performance are compatible with its objectives.

The  Company's   underwriting   strategy   also   emphasizes   flexibility   and
responsiveness  to  changing  market  conditions,  such as  increased  demand or
favorable  pricing  trends.  The Company  believes that its existing  strengths,
including its broad  underwriting  expertise,  U.S.,  Bermuda and  international
presence,  high ratings and substantial capital,  facilitate  adjustments to its
mix of business  geographically,  by line of business  and by type of  coverage,
allowing  it to  capitalize  on those  market  opportunities  that  provide  the
greatest  potential for  underwriting  profitability.  The  Company's  insurance
operations  complement  these  strategies  by  allowing  the  Company  access to
business  that would not likely be available to it on a reinsurance  basis.  The
Company  carefully  monitors its mix of business  across all operations to avoid
inappropriate concentrations of geographic or other risk.


MARKETING
The Company writes  business on a worldwide  basis for many different  customers
and for many  lines of  business,  providing  a broad  array of  coverages.  The
Company is not  materially  dependent  on any single  customer,  small  group of
customers, line of business or geographical area. For the 2002 calendar year, no
single  customer  (ceding  company or insured)  generated  more than 7.4% of the
Company's gross premiums written.  The Company does not believe that a reduction
of business from any one customer  would have a material  adverse  effect on its
future  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations  due to the  Company's
competitive  position in the market  place and the  continuing  availability  of
other sources of business.

Approximately  48.6%,  22.5%  and 28.9% of the  Company's  2002  gross  premiums
written were written in the broker reinsurance, direct reinsurance and insurance
markets,  respectively.  The Company's ability to write reinsurance both through
brokers and directly with ceding  companies  gives it the  flexibility to pursue
business  regardless of the ceding company's  preferred  reinsurance  purchasing
method.

The  reinsurance  broker  market  consists of several  substantial  national and
international  brokers and a number of smaller specialized  brokers.  Brokers do
not  have  the  authority  to bind  the  Company  with  respect  to  reinsurance
agreements,  nor does the Company commit in advance to accept any portion of the
business  that  brokers  submit  to it.  Reinsurance  business  from any  ceding
company,  whether  new or  renewal,  is subject to  acceptance  by the  Company.
Brokerage  fees are  generally  paid by  reinsurers.  The  Company's ten largest
brokers  accounted  for an aggregate of  approximately  39.0% of gross  premiums
written  in  2002,  with  each  of  the  two  largest  brokers   accounting  for
approximately  12.9%  and 12.4% of gross  premiums  written,  respectively.  The
Company  does not believe  that a reduction  of  business  assumed  from any one
broker  would  have  a  materially  adverse  effect  on the  Company  due to its
competitive  position in the market place,  relationships  with ceding companies
and the continuing availability of other sources of business.

The direct  market  remains an  important  distribution  system for  reinsurance
business  written by the Company.  Direct  placement of reinsurance  enables the
Company to access  clients who prefer to place their  reinsurance  directly with
reinsurers  based  upon the  reinsurer's  in-depth  understanding  of the ceding
company's needs. The Company's insurance business is written principally through
general agent  relationships  and surplus lines brokers.  The Company's  largest
agency relationship accounted for approximately 15.9% of gross premiums written,
which  consists  of  approximately   27,800  individual  workers'   compensation
policies.

The Company  evaluates each business  relationship,  including the  underwriting
expertise  and  experience  of  each  distribution  channel  selected,  performs
analyses to evaluate financial security and monitors performance.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
The  Company,  through  its  subsidiaries,   operates  in  five  segments:  U.S.
Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting,  International and Bermuda.
The U.S. Reinsurance  operation writes property and casualty reinsurance on both
a treaty and facultative basis through  reinsurance  brokers as well as directly
with ceding companies  within the United States.  The U.S.  Insurance  operation
writes  property  and  casualty   insurance   primarily  through  general  agent
relationships and surplus lines brokers within the United States.  The Specialty
Underwriting  operation writes A&H, marine,  aviation and surety business within
the United  States and  worldwide  through  brokers  and  directly  with  ceding
companies.  The International operation writes property and casualty reinsurance


through the Company's branches in London,  Canada and Singapore,  in addition to
foreign business written through the Company's New Jersey headquarters and Miami
office.  The  Bermuda  operation  writes  property,  casualty,  life and annuity
business through brokers and directly with ceding companies.

These  segments  are  managed in a  carefully  coordinated  fashion  with strong
elements of central control, including with respect to capital,  investments and
support operations. As a result, management monitors and evaluates the financial
performance  of  these   operating   segments   principally   based  upon  their
underwriting results. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate  reinsurance but such
reinsurance  does not  impact  segment  results,  since  business  is  generally
reported  within  the  segment in which the  business  was first  produced.  For
selected financial information regarding these segments, see Note 17 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

UNDERWRITING OPERATIONS
The following  table presents the  distribution  of the Company's gross premiums
written  by  its  U.S.  Reinsurance,  U.S.  Insurance,  Specialty  Underwriting,
International  and Bermuda  operations  for the years ended  December  31, 2002,
2001,  2000,  1999 and 1998,  classified  according  to whether  the  premium is
derived  from  property or casualty  business  and,  for  reinsurance  business,
whether it represents pro rata or excess of loss business:

U.S.  REINSURANCE  OPERATION.  The Company's U.S.  Reinsurance  operation writes
property  and  casualty  reinsurance,  both  treaty  and  facultative,   through
reinsurance  brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the United
States.  The Company  targets  certain  brokers and,  through the broker market,
specialty  companies and small to medium sized  standard lines  companies.  On a
direct  basis,   the  Company  targets   companies  that  place  their  business
predominantly  in the direct  market,  including  small to medium sized regional
ceding  companies,  and seeks to  develop  long-term  relationships  with  those
companies.  In  addition,  the U.S.  Reinsurance  operation  writes  portions of
reinsurance programs for larger, national insurance companies.

In 2002,  $230.9 million of gross  premiums  written were  attributable  to U.S.
treaty property business,  of which 35.6% was written on an excess of loss basis
and 64.4% was written on a pro rata basis. The Company's  property  underwriters
utilize  sophisticated   underwriting  methods  which  management  believes  are
necessary to analyze and price property  business,  particularly that segment of
the property market which has catastrophe exposure.

U.S.  treaty  casualty  business  accounted for $418.1 million of gross premiums
written in 2002, of which 47.6% was written on an excess of loss basis and 52.4%
was  written on a pro rata  basis.  The treaty  casualty  portfolio  consists of
professional liability, D&O liability, workers' compensation, excess and surplus
lines,  and other  liability  coverages.  As a result of the  complex  technical
nature of most of these  risks,  the  Company's  casualty  underwriters  tend to
specialize  by line of business  and work  closely  with the  Company's  pricing
actuaries.

The  Company's  facultative  unit  conducts  business  both through  brokers and
directly  with  ceding  companies,  and  consists  of  four  underwriting  units
representing  property,  casualty,  specialty  and national  brokerage  lines of
business. Business is written from a facultative headquarters office in New York
and satellite  offices in Chicago and Oakland.  In 2002,  $71.4 million,  $133.5
million,  $17.3  million  and  $23.4  million  of gross  premiums  written  were
attributable to the property,  casualty,  specialty and national brokerage lines
of business, respectively.

In 2002,  79.9% and 20.1% of the U.S.  Reinsurance  operation's  gross  premiums
written were written in the broker and direct reinsurance markets, respectively.

U.S. INSURANCE OPERATION.  In 2002, the Company's U.S. Insurance operation wrote
$821.5  million of gross  premiums,  of which  99.2% was  casualty  and 0.8% was
property.  Of  the  casualty  business,   the  predominant  class  was  workers'
compensation  insurance.  Everest  National  wrote $706.1 million and Everest Re
wrote $14.1 million,  with both principally  targeting  commercial  property and
casualty  business  written  through general agency  relationships  with program
administrators.  Everest  Indemnity wrote $78.1 million,  principally  targeting
excess and surplus  lines  insurance  business  written  through  surplus  lines
brokers.   Everest   Security   wrote  $23.2  million,   principally   targeting
non-standard  auto business  written through retail agency  relationships.  With
respect to insurance  written  through general agents and surplus lines brokers,
the Company supplements the initial  underwriting  process with periodic claims,
underwriting and operational reviews and ongoing monitoring.


SPECIALTY UNDERWRITING OPERATION. The Company's Specialty Underwriting operation
writes A&H,  marine,  aviation and surety  reinsurance.  The A&H unit  primarily
focuses on health  reinsurance  of  traditional  indemnity  plans,  self-insured
health plans and specialty  medical plans.  The marine and aviation unit focuses
on ceding companies with a particular expertise in marine and aviation business.
The marine and  aviation  business  is written  primarily  through  brokers  and
contains a significant  international  component written primarily in the London
market.   Surety  business  underwritten  by  the  Company  consists  mainly  of
reinsurance of contract surety bonds.

Gross premiums written by the A&H unit in 2002 totaled $314.4 million,  of which
$78.1  million was  written  through  the broker  market and $236.3  million was
written through the direct market.

Gross  premiums  written by the marine and aviation  unit in 2002 totaled  $94.1
million,  substantially  all of which was written on a treaty basis and 86.6% of
which was sourced through reinsurance brokers. Marine treaties represented 49.9%
of marine and aviation  gross premiums  written in 2002 and consisted  mainly of
hull and liability coverage.  Approximately 69.4% of the marine unit premiums in
2002 were  written  on a pro rata  basis  and 30.6% as excess of loss.  Aviation
premiums  accounted for 50.1% of marine and aviation gross  premiums  written in
2002 and included  reinsurance  for airlines,  general  aviation and satellites.
Approximately  88.8% of the aviation  unit's  premiums in 2002 were written on a
pro rata basis and 11.2% as excess of loss.

In 2002,  gross  premiums  written by the surety  unit  totaled  $80.1  million.
Approximately  69.4% of the surety unit  premiums in 2002 were  written on a pro
rata  basis  and  30.6% on an excess of loss  basis.  Most of the  portfolio  is
reinsurance  of contract  surety bonds written  directly with ceding  companies,
with the remainder being credit reinsurance, mostly in international markets.

INTERNATIONAL  OPERATION.  The Company's  International operation is designed to
enable  it to  capitalize  on the  growth  opportunities  in  the  international
reinsurance   market.  The  Company  targets  several   international   markets,
including:  Europe and the London  markets,  which are  serviced  by a branch in
London;  Canada, with a branch in Toronto; Asia and Australia,  with a branch in
Singapore;  and Latin  America,  Africa and the Middle East,  which  business is
serviced from Everest Re's New Jersey headquarters and Miami office. The Company
also  writes  "home-foreign"   business,   which  provides  reinsurance  on  the
international portfolios of U.S. insurers, from New Jersey.  Approximately 83.4%
of the gross premiums  written by the Company's  international  underwriters  in
2002  represented  property  business,  while the balance  represented  casualty
business.  As with its U.S. operations,  the Company's  International  operation
focuses  on  financially   sound  companies  that  have  strong  management  and
underwriting  discipline  and  expertise.  Approximately  73.4% of the Company's
international  business was written through brokers,  with the remainder written
directly with ceding companies.

In 2002,  the Company's  gross  premiums  written by its London  branch  totaled
$186.5  million and  consisted of pro rata  property  (56.8%),  excess  property
(24.1%), pro rata casualty (3.9%) and excess casualty (15.2%). Substantially all
of the London premiums consisted of treaty reinsurance.


Gross premiums written by the Company's Canadian office totaled $74.0 million in
2002 and consisted of pro rata property (51.3%),  excess property  (21.5%),  pro
rata multi-line (2.7%) and excess casualty (24.4%).  Approximately  76.4% of the
Canadian premiums consisted of treaty  reinsurance,  while 23.4% was facultative
reinsurance.

The  Company's  Singapore  branch  covers the Asian and  Australian  markets and
accounted  for $25.5 million of gross  written  premiums in 2002.  This business
consisted  of pro rata  property  (56.4%),  excess  property  (33.4%),  pro rata
casualty (9.0%) and excess casualty (1.2%).

International  business written out of Everest Re's New Jersey and Miami offices
accounted for $254.9 million of gross premiums  written in 2002 and consisted of
pro rata treaty property (66.8%), pro rata treaty casualty (9.3%), excess treaty
property (15.5%),  excess treaty casualty (2.6%) and excess facultative property
and casualty  (5.8%).  Of this  international  business,  67.6% was sourced from
Latin  America,  27.3% was sourced from the Middle  East,  3.2% was sourced from
Europe, Africa and Asia, and 1.9% was "home-foreign" business.

BERMUDA  OPERATION.  The Company's Bermuda operation writes property,  casualty,
life and annuity  business  through  Bermuda Re. In 2002, the Bermuda  operation
continued to scale up and had gross  property and casualty  premiums  written of
$101.0 million.

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
The Company  conducts  its  business in Bermuda,  in the United  States and in a
number of foreign countries.  For select financial  information about geographic
areas,  see Note 17 of Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Risks
attendant to the foreign  operations of the Company  parallel those attendant to
the United  States  operations  of the  Company,  with the primary  exception of
foreign  exchange risks.  See ITEM 7,  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Safe Harbor Disclosure".

UNDERWRITING PROCESS
The  Company  offers  ceding  companies  full  service   capability,   including
actuarial,  claims,  accounting and systems support,  either directly or through
the broker  community.  The  Company's  capacity for both  property and casualty
risks allows it to underwrite  entire  contracts or major portions  thereof that
might otherwise need to be syndicated  among several  reinsurers.  The Company's
strategy is to act as "lead"  reinsurer in many of the  reinsurance  treaties it
underwrites. The lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest
percentage  shares of the  treaty  and is in a stronger  position  to  negotiate
price,  terms and conditions than is a reinsurer that takes a smaller  position.
Management  believes this strategy enables it to more effectively  influence the
terms and conditions of the treaties on which it participates.  When the Company
does not lead the  treaty,  it may still  suggest  changes  to any aspect of the
treaty.  The  Company  may  decline to  participate  in a treaty  based upon its
assessment of all relevant factors.


The Company's treaty  underwriting  process emphasizes a team approach among the
Company's  underwriters,  actuaries  and claim staff.  Treaties are reviewed for
compliance with the Company's general underwriting  standards and certain larger
treaties are evaluated in part based upon actuarial analyses by the Company. The
actuarial  models  used in  such  analyses  are  tailored  in  each  case to the
exposures and experience  underlying the specific treaty and the loss experience
for the risks covered by such treaties. The Company does not separately evaluate
each of the  individual  risks  assumed  under its  treaties.  The Company does,
however,  generally evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies
to determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty.  The Company,  when
appropriate,  also conducts  underwriting,  operational  and claim audits at the
offices of ceding companies to ensure that the ceding  companies  operate within
such  guidelines.  Underwriting  audits focus on the quality of the underwriting
staff, the selection and pricing of risks and the capability of monitoring price
levels over time.  Claim  audits,  when  appropriate,  are performed in order to
evaluate the client's claims handling abilities and practices.

The Company's U.S. facultative underwriters operate within guidelines specifying
acceptable types of risks, limits and maximum risk exposures.  Specified classes
of  risks  and  large  premium  risks  are  referred  to  Everest  Re's New York
facultative headquarters for specific review before premium quotations are given
to clients. In addition, the Company's guidelines require certain types of risks
to be submitted  for review  because of their  aggregate  limits,  complexity or
volatility,  regardless  of  premium  amount  or  size  of  the  insured  on the
underlying contract.

The  Company's  insurance  operations  principally  write  property and casualty
coverages for homogeneous risks through select program managers.  These programs
are  evaluated  based  upon  actuarial   analysis  and  the  program   manager's
capabilities.  The  Company's  rates,  forms  and  underwriting  guidelines  are
tailored to specific risk types. The Company's  underwriting,  actuarial,  claim
and  financial  functions  work closely  with its program  managers to establish
appropriate  underwriting  and  processing  guidelines  as well  as  appropriate
monitoring mechanisms.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND RETROCESSION ARRANGEMENTS
The Company manages its risk of loss through a combination of aggregate exposure
limits,  underwriting  guidelines  that  take into  account  risks,  prices  and
coverage, and retrocessional arrangements.

The  Company is exposed  to  multiple  insured  losses  arising  out of a single
occurrence,  whether a natural event,  such as a hurricane or an earthquake,  or
other  catastrophe,   such  as  an  explosion  at  a  major  factory.  Any  such
catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one or many of the Company's
treaties or lines of business, including property and/or casualty exposures. The
Company employs various  techniques,  including licensed software  modeling,  to
assess its accumulated  exposure.  Such techniques are inherently more difficult
to apply to  non-property  exposures.  Accumulated  exposures  with  respect  to
catastrophe  losses are generally  summarized  in terms of the probable  maximum
loss ("PML").  The Company defines PML as its anticipated  maximum loss,  taking
into account contract limits,  caused by a single catastrophe  affecting a broad
contiguous  geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake of
such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in every 100 years.

Management believes that the Company's greatest  catastrophe exposure world wide
from any single event is to an earthquake affecting the west coast of the United
States  where the  Company  estimates  it has a PML  exposure  of $338  million,
including workers'  compensation  exposures.  The Company further estimates that
its PML exposure with respect to its greatest windstorm exposure,  which relates
to a hurricane  affecting the east coast of the United  States,  is $264 million
and that its single event International PML exposure is $197 million.  There can


be no  assurance  that the Company will not  experience  losses from one or more
catastrophic events that exceed,  perhaps by a substantial amount, its estimated
PML.

The U.S.  Terrorism  Risk  Insurance Act of 2002 was signed into law in November
2002. This legislation provides Federal  reimbursement of 90% of insured losses,
in excess of statutory retention levels, due to acts of terrorism carried out by
foreign  powers on U.S.  soil or against U.S. air  carriers,  vessels or foreign
missions.  This coverage does not apply to  reinsurance.  Reinsurance  contracts
generally  exclude  losses  arising  from  terrorist  events,  except where such
coverage has been  specifically  included in the underwriting and pricing of the
involved  reinsurance.  The Company does not believe that this  legislation will
have a significant impact on its operations.

Underwriting  guidelines  have been  established  for each business unit.  These
guidelines  place  dollar  limits on the amount of business  that can be written
based on a variety of  factors,  including  ceding  company,  line of  business,
geographical  location and risk hazards.  In each case, those guidelines  permit
limited exceptions, which must be authorized by the Company's senior management.

The  Company  employs a  retrocessional  approach  under  which the  Company may
purchase   reinsurance   to  cover   specific   business   written  or  exposure
accumulations  or as a  corporate  level  retrocessional  program  covering  the
potential  accumulation  or aggregation  of exposures  across some or all of the
Company's  operations.  All reinsurance  purchasing  decisions consider both the
potential  coverage and market  conditions  with respect to the pricing,  terms,
conditions  and  availability  of  such  coverage,  with  the  aim  of  securing
cost-effective  protection.  The level of reinsurance coverage varies over time,
reflecting the  underwriter's  and/or Company's view of the changing dynamics of
both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets.

The  Company  does  not  typically   purchase   reinsurance  to  cover  specific
reinsurance   business  written,   but  it  does  from  time  to  time  purchase
retrocessional  protections where underwriting management deems it to be prudent
and/or cost-effective to reinsure a portion of the specific risks being assumed.
In  2001  and  2000,  the  Company  purchased  an  excess  property  facultative
retrocessional  program  and  an  excess  workers'  compensation  retrocessional
program.  In  addition,  the Company  purchased an excess  property  catastrophe
retrocessional  program for losses  incurred  outside of the U.S. for 2002, 2001
and 2000.  The Company  also  participates  in "common  account"  retrocessional
arrangements  for  certain  reinsurance  treaties.  Common  account  reinsurance
arrangements are arrangements  whereby the ceding company purchases  reinsurance
for the benefit of itself and its  reinsurers on one or more of its  reinsurance
treaties.  Common  account  retrocessional  arrangements  reduce  the  effect of
individual or aggregate  losses to all  participating  companies,  including the
ceding company, with respect to the involved treaties.

The Company  typically  considers the purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance
programs written by the U.S. Insurance  operation.  Such consideration  includes
balancing the underlying  exposures  against the availability of  cost-effective
reinsurance  protection.  For policies  incepting on or after November 1998, the
Company purchased a workers' compensation  reinsurance program that provided for
statutory  limits  coverage in excess of $75,000 of losses per occurrence on the
Company's workers' compensation  insurance business written prior to November 1,
2000.  Since November 1, 2000, this primary  workers'  compensation  reinsurance


program  provides  statutory limits coverage in excess of $250,000 of losses per
occurrence for business  written prior to December 31, 2001. The Company has not
purchased  such  coverage for the period  subsequent  to December  31, 2001.  In
addition,  for the  twelve-month  period  commencing  July 31, 2000, the Company
purchased  reinsurance  for a specific  program of  business.  The  reinsurance,
subject to certain aggregate limits,  covered U.S. Longshore and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act and state act workers'  compensation  business for 100% of loss
occurrences  up to $100 million.  Consistent  with the $1 million  limits of the
underlying  policies in the program,  reinsurance for 100% of Maritime Employers
Liability and Employers Liability was also provided. Neither the program nor the
reinsurance were purchased in 2002 or 2001.

The Company also considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional  protection
covering the potential  accumulation of exposures.  Such consideration  includes
balancing the underlying  exposures  against the availability of  cost-effective
retrocessional  protection.  For 2001,  the Company  purchased an accident  year
aggregate  excess of loss  retrocession  agreement  which  provides up to $175.0
million of coverage if Everest Re's  consolidated  statutory basis accident year
loss ratio exceeds a loss ratio  attachment  point  provided in the contract for
the 2001 accident year. The attachment  point is net of inuring  reinsurance and
retrocessions and includes  adjustable premium provisions that effectively cause
the  Company to offset,  on a pre-tax  income  basis,  up to 52.9% of such ceded
losses,   depending  upon  the  character  of  the  underlying  losses,  through
additional premiums. The maximum recovery is $175.0 million before giving effect
to a maximum adjustable premium of $82.5 million. Cessions under this cover have
reduced the limit  available  to $0.0  million at  December  31,  2002.  Similar
coverage  was  purchased  and  remains  in effect  for the 2000  accident  year.
Cessions  under this cover have reduced the limit  available to $85.0 million as
of December 31, 2002.  The Company has not  purchased  similar  coverage for the
period subsequent to December 31, 2001.

Although  certain of the  Company's  catastrophe  and  aggregate  excess of loss
retrocessions have terms which provide for additional premiums to be paid to the
retrocessionaire  in the  event  that  losses  are  ceded,  all  aspects  of the
Company's retrocessional program have been structured to permit these agreements
to be accounted for as reinsurance under Financial  Accounting  Standard ("FAS")
No. 113.

If a single catastrophe were to occur in the United States that resulted in $338
million of gross losses and allocated loss adjustment  expenses ("ALAE") in 2003
(an amount equivalent to the Company's PML,  including its property and workers'
compensation  exposures),  management estimates that the effect on the Company's
income would be  approximately  $338  million and $264 million  before and after
taxes, respectively.

In  addition,  the  Company  has  coverage  under an  aggregate  excess  of loss
reinsurance  agreement  provided by Prudential  Property and Casualty  Insurance
Company of Indiana ("Prupac"),  a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential,  in
connection  with the Company's  acquisition of Mt.  McKinley in September  2000.
This  agreement  covers 80% or $160  million  of the first  $200  million of any
adverse loss reserve  development on the carried reserves of Mt. McKinley at the
date of  acquisition  and  reimburses the Company as such losses are paid by the
Company. There were $78.9 million of cessions under this reinsurance at December
31, 2002, reducing the limit available under the contract to $81.1 million.

In connection with the Mt. McKinley acquisition,  Prupac also provided excess of
loss  reinsurance  for 100% of the first $8.5  million  of loss with  respect to
certain  of  Mt.   McKinley's   retrocessions   and  potentially   uncollectible
reinsurance coverage. There were $0.0 million and $3.6 million of cessions under
this  reinsurance  during  the  periods  ending  December  31,  2002  and  2001,
respectively, reducing the limit available under the contract to $2.4 million.


As of December 31, 2002,  the Company  carried as an asset  $1,116.4  million in
reinsurance  receivables  with respect to losses ceded.  Of this amount,  $440.0
million,  or 39.4%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Reinsurance Group
("London  Life"),  $145.0 million,  or 13.0%,  was receivable  from  Continental
Insurance Company ("Continental") and $78.9 million, or 7.1% was receivable from
Prupac.  No other  retrocessionaire  accounted for more than 5% of the Company's
receivables.  See ITEM 7,  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition".

The Company's  arrangements  with London Life and  Continental  are managed on a
funds held basis, which means that the Company has not released premium payments
to the  retrocessionaire  but rather retains such payments to secure obligations
of the  retrocessionaire,  records them as a liability,  credits interest on the
balances  and  reduces  the  liability  account as  payments  become  due. As of
December 31, 2002,  such funds had reduced the  Company's net exposure to London
Life to $190.2 million, effectively 100% of which has been secured by letters of
credit, and its exposure to Continental to $60.9 million.  Prupac's  obligations
are guaranteed by The Prudential.

No  assurance  can be given  that the  Company  will  seek or be able to  obtain
retrocessional  coverage in the future similar to that in place  currently or in
the past. The Company  continuously  evaluates its exposures and risk capacities
in the  context of  reinsurance  market  conditions,  at both the  specific  and
corporate  level.  Although  management  carefully  selects its reinsurers,  the
Company is subject to credit risk with  respect to its  reinsurance  because the
ceding of risk to  reinsurers  does not relieve the Company of its  liability to
insureds or ceding companies.

MT. MCKINLEY INSURANCE COMPANY-ACQUISITION
The Company  completed its  acquisition of Gibraltar,  subsequently  renamed Mt.
McKinley,  in September  2000. In connection  with the  acquisition,  the seller
provided the  reinsurance  described  above and the Company  terminated  certain
relationships  between Mt. McKinley and its former parent,  The Prudential,  and
its affiliates.  Mt.  McKinley's  ongoing  operations relate to servicing claims
arising from (1) insurance  written by Mt. McKinley or Everest Re prior to 1985,
(2)  reinsurance  of  insurance  business  and  certain  Everest Re  reinsurance
business  written prior to 1991 which had  previously  been reinsured with third
parties and commuted with those third parties into Mt. McKinley and (3) exposure
to adverse loss  reserve  development  on Everest  Re's  reserves as of June 30,
1995,  which  exposure was assumed by Mt.  McKinley at the time of the Company's
initial public offering.  Effective September 19, 2000, Mt. McKinley and Bermuda
Re entered into a loss portfolio  transfer  reinsurance  agreement,  whereby Mt.
McKinley   transferred,   for  what  management   believes  to  be  arm's-length
consideration, all of its net insurance exposures and reserves to Bermuda Re.

CLAIMS
Reinsurance claims are managed by the Company's  professional claims staff whose
responsibilities  include  reviewing  initial loss reports and coverage  issues,
monitoring  claims handling  activities of ceding  companies,  establishing  and
adjusting proper case reserves and approving  payment of claims.  In addition to
claims assessment, processing and payment, the claims staff selectively conducts
comprehensive  claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures
at the offices of selected  ceding  companies.  Insurance  claims,  except those
relating to Mt. McKinley's business, are generally handled by third party claims
services providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by
the Company's professional claims staff.


The Company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental ("A&E") exposures
through  dedicated,  centrally managed claim staffs for Mt. McKinley and Everest
Re.  Both are  staffed  with  experienced  claim  and legal  professionals  that
specialize in the handling of such  exposures.  These units actively manage each
individual insured and reinsured account,  responding to claim developments with
evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as appropriate.
Specific or general claim  developments that may have material  implications for
the Company are regularly communicated to senior management, and as appropriate,
to  actuarial,  legal and financial  areas.  Meetings  among these areas,  claim
management  and  senior  management  are held at least  quarterly  to review the
Company's  overall  reserve  positions and make  changes,  if  appropriate.  The
Company  continually  reviews  its  internal   processing,   communications  and
analytics  to  determine  whether  it can  enhance  the  management  of it's A&E
exposures,  in particular in the context of changes in the landscape of asbestos
claims and litigation.

RESERVES FOR UNPAID PROPERTY AND CASUALTY LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES
Significant  periods of time may elapse  between  the  occurrence  of an insured
loss, the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer and the payment
of that loss by the  insurer  and  subsequent  payments  to the  insurer  by the
reinsurer.  To  recognize  liabilities  for unpaid  losses  and loss  adjustment
expenses ("LAE"),  insurers and reinsurers establish reserves, which are balance
sheet  liabilities  representing  estimates  of  future  amounts  needed  to pay
reported and unreported  claims and related expenses on losses that have already
occurred.  Actual losses and LAE paid may deviate,  perhaps substantially,  from
such reserves.  To the extent  reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual
losses and LAE after taking into account  available  reinsurance  coverage,  the
Company  would have to augment  such  reserves  and incur a charge to  earnings,
which could be material in the period such augmentation takes place. See ITEM 7,
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations -- Loss and LAE Reserves".

While the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies,
the inherent  uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the
reinsurer,  due  primarily to the longer time between the date of an  occurrence
and the reporting of any  attendant  claims to the  reinsurer,  the diversity of
development   patterns  among  different   types  of  reinsurance   treaties  or
facultative  contracts,  the  necessary  reliance  on the ceding  companies  for
information  regarding reported claims and differing  reserving  practices among
ceding  companies.  In  addition,  trends  that  have  affected  development  of
liabilities  in  the  past  may  not  necessarily   occur  or  affect  liability
development to the same degree in the future. As a result, actual losses and LAE
may deviate, perhaps substantially,  from estimates of reserves reflected in the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

Like many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance  companies,  the
Company has experienced adverse loss development for prior accident years, which
has led to adjustments in losses and LAE reserves.  The increase in net reserves
for prior  accident  years  reduced  net  income  for the  periods  in which the
adjustments were made.  There can be no assurance that adverse  development from
prior  years will not  continue in the future or that such  adverse  development
will not have a material adverse effect on net income.

CHANGES IN HISTORICAL  RESERVES
The following  table shows  changes in historical  loss reserves for the Company
for 1992 and  subsequent  years.  The table is  presented on a GAAP basis except



that  the  Company's  loss  reserves  for its  Canadian  branch  operations  are
presented in Canadian dollars, the impact of which is not material. The top line
of each table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at
each year-end date. Each amount in the top line represents the estimated  amount
of future  payments  for losses and LAE on claims  occurring in that year and in
all prior years.  The upper (paid)  portion of the table presents the cumulative
amounts  paid through each  subsequent  year on those claims for which  reserves
were carried as of each  specific year end. The lower  (liability  re-estimated)
portion shows the re-estimated  amount of the previously recorded reserves based
on  experience  as of the end of each  succeeding  year.  The  reserve  estimate
changes as more information  becomes known about the actual claims for which the
initial  reserves  were  carried.  The  cumulative   redundancy/deficiency  line
represents  the  cumulative  change in estimates  since the initial  reserve was
established.  It is equal to the latest liability  re-estimated  amount less the
initial reserve.

Each amount other than the original  reserves in the top half of the table below
includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior  periods.  For example,
if a loss settled in 1995 for $100,000 was first reserved in 1992 at $60,000 and
remained  unchanged until settlement,  the $40,000 deficiency (actual loss minus
original estimate) would be included in the cumulative  redundancy  (deficiency)
in each of the years in the period 1992 through 1994 shown below. Conditions and
trends  that  have  affected  development  of  liability  in the  past  are  not
indicative  of  future  developments.  Accordingly,  it is  not  appropriate  to
extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.

                    WITH SUPPLEMENTAL GROSS DATA (1) (2) (3)

- ----------
(1)  Includes  $480.9  million  relating to Mt.  McKinley at December  31, 2000,
     principally  reflecting  $491.1  million of Mt.  McKinley  reserves  at the
     acquisition date.

(3)  Some totals may not reconcile due to rounding.


For years  prior to 1992,  management  believes  that two  factors  had the most
significant impact on loss development.  First, through the mid-1980s,  a number
of industry  and external  factors,  such as the  propensity  of courts to award
large damage awards in liability cases,  combined to increase loss frequency and
severity to unexpectedly  high levels.  Second,  contracts written prior to 1986
contained  coverage  terms  which,  for the Company and the industry in general,
have  been   interpreted  by  courts  to  provide   coverage  for  asbestos  and
environmental  exposures not  contemplated  by either the pricing or the initial
reserving of the contracts. Legal developments during the mid-1980s necessitated
additional reserving for such exposures on both a case basis and an incurred but
not reported  ("IBNR")  basis.  More  recently,  particularly  as reflected  for
periods  subsequent  to 1998,  the Company has  experienced  unforeseen  adverse
shifts in loss emergence patterns, particularly in classes of business where the
underlying  exposures have been impacted by unfavorable trends in litigation and
economic variability.  The change between 1994 and 1995 reflects the impact of a
stop loss reinsurance  agreement with Mt. McKinley,  which was then a subsidiary
of The  Prudential.  This  stop  loss  agreement  commenced  in  1995  when  The
Prudential sold the Company in an initial public offering.  This coverage became
an inter-affiliate  reinsurance transaction with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley
in 2000. See Footnote 1L to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company's loss
and LAE reserves.  While there can be no assurance  that reserves for and losses
from these claims will not increase in the future,  management believes that the
Company's   existing  reserves,   reserving   methodologies  and  retrocessional
arrangements  lessen  the  probability  that any  such  increases  would  have a
material  adverse  effect  on the  Company's  financial  condition,  results  of
operations or cash flows. These statements regarding the Company's loss reserves
are forward looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities
laws and are  intended  to be covered by the safe  harbor  provisions  contained
therein. See ITEM 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Safe Harbor Disclosure."

The  following  table is derived from the Ten Year GAAP Loss  Development  Table
above and summarizes the effect of reserve re-estimates,  net of reinsurance, on
calendar year  operations for the same ten-year  period ended December 31, 2002.
Each column represents the amount of reserve  re-estimates made in the indicated
calendar  year and  shows  the  accident  years to which  the  re-estimates  are
applicable.  The  amounts  in the total  accident  year  column on the far right
represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates for the indicated accident years.

(1)  Some totals may not reconcile due to rounding.


As illustrated by this table, the factors that caused the deficiencies  shown in
the Ten Year GAAP Loss  Development  Table relate mainly to accident years prior
to  1992  principally  reflecting  the  impact  of  asbestos  and  environmental
exposures discussed above. The significant favorable development experienced for
the 1995 accident year is due to aggregate excess of loss  reinsurance  provided
to the  Company  at the time of its  initial  public  offering.  This  contract,
because of its 1995 inception date, is attributed to the 1995 accident year. The
adverse development  experienced in the 1998 through 2001 accident years relates
principally to a limited number of business  classes,  mainly casualty  classes,
including  D&O,  surety and certain  international  business  where adverse loss
experience has emerged as the result of unforeseen  loss trend shifts  affecting
the  underlying   exposures.   The  Company's   loss   reserving   methodologies
continuously  monitor the emergence of such loss trend  shifts,  seeking both to
adjust  reserves  for their  impact  and to factor  such  developments  into its
underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis.

The following  table presents a  reconciliation  of beginning and ending reserve
balances for the years indicated on a GAAP basis:


                  RECONCILIATION OF RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LAE

(1)  Current  year paid  losses for 2000 are net of ($483.8)  million  resulting
     from the acquisition of Mt. McKinley.

Prior year incurred  losses  increased by $140.1 million in 2002 and were stable
in 2001. These changes were the result of the reserve  development  noted above,
as well as inherent uncertainty in establishing loss and LAE reserves.  See also
Note 1L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


RESERVES FOR ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES
The Company's  reserves include an estimate of the Company's  ultimate liability
for A&E claims for which  ultimate value cannot be estimated  using  traditional
reserving  techniques.  There are  significant  uncertainties  in estimating the
amount  of  the  Company's  potential  losses  from  A&E  claims.  See  ITEM  7,
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations  -  Asbestos  and  Environmental  Exposures"  and  Note 3 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mt.  McKinley's  book of direct A&E exposed  insurance is  relatively  small and
homogenous.  The book of  business  is based  principally  on  excess  liability
policies;  thus the  claim/legal  staff does not have to analyze  exposure under
many  different  policy  forms,  but  rather  can focus on a  limited  number of
policies and policy forms.  As a result of this focused  structure,  the Company
believes that it is able to comprehensively  analyze its exposures,  allowing it
to identify and analyze those claims on which it has unusual  exposure,  such as
policies in which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits
or non-products asbestos claims, for concentrated ongoing attention.

The Company  aims to be  actively  engaged  with every  insured  account  posing
significant  potential  asbestos  exposure to Mt. McKinley.  Such engagement can
take the form of a final settlement, negotiation,  litigation, or the monitoring
of claim  activity under  Coverage in Place ("CIP")  agreements.  CIP agreements
generally condition an insurer's payment upon the actual claim experience of the
insured  and may have  annual  payment  caps or other  measures  to control  the
insurer's payments. The Company's Mt. McKinley operations are currently managing
five CIP agreements,  all of which were executed prior to the acquisition of Mt.
McKinley in 2000.  Its  preference  with respect to coverage  settlements  is to
execute  settlements  that call for a fixed  schedule of payments,  because such
settlements eliminate future uncertainty.

During 2002, the Company  significantly  enhanced its classification of insureds
by  exposure  characteristics,  as well as its  analysis by insured for those it
considers to be more exposed or active.  Those insureds identified as relatively
less  exposed  or  active  are  subject  to  less  rigorous,  but  still  active
management,  with an  emphasis on  monitoring  those  characteristics  which may
indicate an increasing  exposure or levels of activity.  The Company continually
focuses on further  enhancement  of the detailed  estimation  processes  used to
evaluate potential exposure of policyholders,  including those that may not have
reported significant A&E losses.

Everest Re's book of assumed  reinsurance  is relatively  concentrated  within a
modest  number of A&E  exposed  relationships.  Because  the book of business is
relatively  concentrated and the Company has been managing the A&E exposures for
many  years,  its claim staff is familiar  with the ceding  companies  that have
generated  most of these  liabilities  in the past and which are therefore  most
likely to generate future  liabilities.  The Company's claim staff has developed
familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies
and the claims handling and reserving  practices of those companies.  This level
of  familiarity  enhances the quality of the Company's  analysis of its exposure
through those companies.  As a result, the Company believes that it can identify
those claims on which it has unusual  exposure,  such as  non-products  asbestos
claims, for concentrated attention.


The following  table  summarizes the composition of the Company's total reserves
for A&E losses,  gross and net of reinsurance,  for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000.


- ------------------
(1)  In 2000,  Holdings  acquired Mt. McKinley,  resulting in an increase to the
     Company's gross and net asbestos and environmental exposure.

Additional  losses,  including those relating to currently  unrecognized  latent
injuries,  the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the Company,  or
the reinsurance and insurance industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such
future  emergence,   to  the  extent  not  covered  by  existing  retrocessional
contracts, could have material adverse effects on the Company's future financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

FUTURE POLICY BENEFIT RESERVES
Future policy benefit  liabilities for annuities are reported at the accumulated
fund balance of these  contracts.  Reserves for those  liabilities  include both
mortality and morbidity provisions with respect to life and annuity claims, both
reported and unreported.  Actual  experience in a particular period may be worse
than assumed  experience and,  consequently,  may adversely affect the Company's
operating results for the period. See Note 1F of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

INVESTMENTS
The Company's overall financial strength and results of operations are, in part,
dependent  on the quality  and  performance  of its  investment  portfolio.  Net



investment  income and net  realized  capital  gains  (losses) on the  Company's
invested assets  constituted  11.8%,  17.7%, and 20.4% of the Company's revenues
for the  years  ending  December  31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The
Company's  cash and invested  assets  totaled  $7,259.1  million at December 31,
2002, of which 94.5% were cash or investment-grade fixed maturities.

The Company's current  investment  strategy seeks to maximize  after-tax income,
through a high  quality,  diversified,  taxable bond and  tax-preferenced  fixed
maturity  portfolio,  while  maintaining  an adequate  level of  liquidity.  The
Company's   mix  of  taxable  and   tax-preferenced   investments   is  adjusted
continuously,  consistent  with the Company's  current and  projected  operating
results, market conditions and tax position.  Additionally,  the Company invests
in equity  securities,  which it believes will enhance the  risk-adjusted  total
return of the investment portfolio.

The  board  of  directors  of  each  company  is  responsible  for  establishing
investment  policy and  guidelines  and,  together with senior  management,  for
overseeing their execution.  The Company's investment portfolio is in compliance
with the  insurance  laws of the  jurisdictions  in which its  subsidiaries  are
regulated. An independent investment advisor is utilized to manage the Company's
investment portfolio within the established guidelines and is required to report
activities  on a  current  basis and to meet with the  Company  periodically  to
review and discuss the portfolio structure, securities selection and performance
results.

The Company's investment guidelines include a current duration guideline of five
to six years.  The  duration of an  investment  is based on the  maturity of the
security but also reflects the payment of interest and the  possibility of early
prepayment of such security.  This investment  duration guideline is established
and periodically  revised by management,  which considers  economic and business
factors.  An important factor  considered by management is the Company's average
duration of potential liabilities,  which, at December 31, 2002, is estimated at
approximately  five  years  based  on  the  estimated  payouts  of  underwriting
liabilities using standard duration calculations.

Approximately 7.6% of the Company's consolidated reserves for losses and LAE and
unearned premiums represent estimated amounts payable in foreign currencies. For
each currency in which the Company has  established  substantial  reserves,  the
Company seeks to maintain  invested  assets  denominated  in such currency in an
amount approximately comparable to the estimated liabilities.

As of December 31, 2002, 98.6% of the Company's total  investments and cash were
comprised of fixed maturity investments or cash and 94.5% of the Company's fixed
maturities  consisted of investment  grade  securities.  The average maturity of
fixed  maturities was 8.1 years at December 31, 2002, and their overall duration
was 5.4 years. As of December 31, 2002, the Company did not have any investments
in  commercial  real  estate  or direct  commercial  mortgages  or any  material
holdings  of   derivative   investments   or  securities  of  issuers  that  are
experiencing  cash flow  difficulty to an extent that the  Company's  management
believes  could  threaten  the issuer's  ability to meet debt service  payments,
except where other than temporary impairments have been recognized.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company's common stock portfolio had a market value
of $47.5  million,  comprising  0.7% of total  investments  and cash. The common
stock portfolio is managed with a growth orientation.


The following table reflects  investment results for the Company for each of the
five years in the period ended December 31, 2002:


- -----------------
(1)  Average of the  beginning and ending  carrying  values of  investments  and
     cash,  less net funds held and  non-interest  bearing cash.  Bonds,  common
     stock and redeemable  and  non-redeemable  preferred  stocks are carried at
     market value.
(2)  After investment expenses, excluding realized net capital gains (losses).

RATINGS
The  following  table  shows the  financial  strength  ratings of the  Company's
operating  subsidiaries  as  reported  by A.M.  Best,  Standard & Poor's  Rating
Services ("Standard & Poor's") and Moody's Investor Service,  Inc.  ("Moody's").
These ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders  and should not
be  considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in an equity
investment in an insurance company.



A.M.  Best  states  that the  "A+"  ("Superior")  rating  is  assigned  to those
companies which, in its opinion,  have, on balance,  achieved superior financial
strength,  operating  performance  and  market  profile  when  compared  to  the
standards  established by A.M. Best and have  demonstrated a very strong ability
to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. The "A+" ("Superior") rating
is the second highest of fifteen ratings assigned by A.M. Best, which range from
"A++" ("Superior") to "F" ("In Liquidation"). Additionally, A.M. Best has eleven
classifications  within the "Not  Assigned"  category.  Standard & Poor's states
that the "AA-" rating is assigned to those  insurance  companies  which,  in its
opinion,   offer  excellent  financial  security  and  whose  capacity  to  meet
policyholder  obligations is strong under a variety of economic and underwriting
conditions.  The "AA-" rating is the fourth highest of nineteen ratings assigned
by Standard & Poor's, which range from "AAA" to "R". Ratings from AA to B may be
modified  by the use of a plus or minus sign to show  relative  standing  of the
insurer within those rating categories.  Moody's states that insurance companies
rated "Aa"  offer  excellent  financial  security.  Together  with the Aaa rated
companies,  Aa rated companies constitute what are generally known as high grade
companies,  with Aa rated companies  generally  having somewhat larger long-term
risks.  Moody's  rating  gradations  are shown  through the use of nine distinct
symbols,  each  symbol  representing  a group of ratings in which the  financial
security is broadly the same. The "Aa3" (Excellent) rating is the fourth highest
of ratings  assigned by Moody's,  which  range from "Aaa"  (Exceptional)  to "C"
(Lowest).  Moody's  further  distinguishes  the ranking of an insurer within its
generic  rating  classification  from  Aa to B with  1, 2 and 3 ("1"  being  the
highest).


The following table shows the investment  grade ratings of the Holdings'  senior
notes due March 15, 2005,  Holdings' senior notes due March 15, 2010 and Capital
Trust's trust preferred  securities by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.
Debt ratings are a current  assessment  of the  credit-worthiness  of an obligor
with respect to a specific obligation.



A company with a debt rating of "a" or "a-" is considered by A.M. Best to have a
strong  capacity  and  willingness  to meet  the  terms  of the  obligation  and
possesses a low level of credit risk. The "a" and "a-" ratings are the sixth and
seventh highest of 19 ratings  assigned by A.M. Best,  which range from "aaa" to
"ccc".  A company with a debt rating of "A-" is  considered by Standard & Poor's
to have a strong  capacity to pay interest and repay  principal,  although it is
somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and
economic conditions than debt in higher rated categories.  A company with a debt
rating of "BBB" is considered by Standard & Poor's to have adequate  capacity to
pay interest and repay  principal,  but is susceptible to the adverse effects of
changes in  circumstances  and  economic  conditions  than debt in higher  rated
categories.  The "A-" and "BBB"  ratings from  Standard & Poor's are the seventh
and ninth highest of 24 ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's,  which range from
"AAA" to "D".  A  company  with a debt  rating  of "A3" is  considered  to be an
upper-medium-grade  obligation  by  Moody's.  This  rating  represents  adequate
capacity with respect to repayment of principal  and interest,  but elements may
be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment  sometime in the future.
A  company  with a debt  rating of "Baa1"  is  considered  to be a  medium-grade
obligation by Moody's.  This rating represents adequate capacity with respect to
repayment of principal  and  interest,  but certain  protective  elements may be
lacking or may be  characteristically  unreliable over any great length of time.
The "A3" and "Baa1"  ratings are the  seventh  and eighth  highest of 21 ratings
assigned by Moody's, which range from "AAA" to "C".

All of the  above-mentioned  ratings are continually  monitored and revised,  if
necessary, by each of the rating agencies.

COMPETITION
The worldwide  reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive,  yet
cyclical by product and market. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 (the
"September 11 attacks")  resulted in losses which reduced industry  capacity and
were of sufficient  magnitude to cause most  companies to reassess their capital
position,  tolerance for risk, exposure control mechanisms and the pricing terms
and  conditions  at which they are  willing  to take on risk.  The  gradual  and
variable improving trend that had been apparent through 2000 and earlier in 2001
firmed significantly after the September 11 attacks. This firming generally took
the  form  of  immediate  and  significant  upward  pressure  on  prices,   more
restrictive terms and conditions and a reduction of coverage limits and capacity
availability.  Such pressures were widespread, with variability depending on the
product and markets involved, but mainly depending on the characteristics of the
underlying risk exposures. The magnitude of the changes was sufficient to create
temporary  disequilibrium  in some  markets as  individual  buyers  and  sellers
adapted to changes in both their internal and market dynamics.


During 2002,  the  reinsurance  and insurance  markets  continued to firm.  This
firming  reflects the losses  arising  from the  September 11 attacks as well as
reactions to broad and growing  recognition  that  competition in the late 1990s
reached extremes in many classes and markets, which ultimately led to inadequate
pricing and overly broad terms,  conditions and  coverages.  The effect of these
extremes,  which is becoming apparent through  excessive loss emergence,  varies
widely by company depending on product offerings, markets accessed, underwriting
and operating practices, competitive strategies and business volumes. Across all
market  participants;  however, the aggregate effect has been impaired financial
results and erosion of the industry  capital  base.  Coupled with  deteriorating
investment  market  conditions  and  results,  and  renewed  concerns  regarding
longer-term  industry specific issues,  including  asbestos exposure and sub-par
capital returns,  these financial  impacts have introduced  substantial,  and in
some  cases  extreme,  pressure  for  the  initiation  and/or  strengthening  of
corrective  action by  individual  market  participants.  These  pressures  have
resulted in firming prices,  more restrictive terms and conditions and tightened
coverage availability across most classes and markets.

These  changes  reflect a clear  reversal of the general trend from 1987 through
1999 toward increasingly  competitive global market conditions across most lines
of business as reflected by decreasing prices and broadening contract terms. The
earlier  trend  resulted  from a number of factors,  including  the emergence of
significant  reinsurance  capacity  in Bermuda,  changes in the Lloyd's  market,
consolidation  and increased  capital  levels in the  insurance and  reinsurance
industries,  as well as the emergence of new reinsurance and financial  products
addressing traditional exposures in alternative fashions.  Many of these factors
continue to exist and have taken on  additional  importance as the result of the
firming  conditions  which have  emerged.  As a result,  although the Company is
encouraged by the recent  improvements,  and more  generally,  by current market
conditions, the Company cannot predict with any reasonable certainty whether and
to what extent these improvements will persist.

Competition  with respect to the types of reinsurance and insurance  business in
which the Company is engaged is based on many  factors,  including the perceived
overall  financial  strength of the  reinsurer or insurer,  A.M.  Best's  and/or
Standard & Poor's  rating of the reinsurer or insurer,  underwriting  expertise,
the  jurisdictions  where the  reinsurer  or insurer is  licensed  or  otherwise
authorized,  capacity and coverages offered,  premiums charged,  other terms and
conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered,  services offered,
speed of claims payment and  reputation  and  experience in lines  written.  The
Company competes in the United States, Bermuda and international reinsurance and
insurance  markets with  numerous  international  and domestic  reinsurance  and
insurance companies.  The Company's competitors include independent  reinsurance
and insurance  companies,  subsidiaries  or affiliates of established  worldwide
insurance companies,  reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and
domestic  and  international  underwriting  operations,  including  underwriting
syndicates  at  Lloyd's.  Some  of  these  competitors  have  greater  financial
resources  than  the  Company  and have  established  long-term  and  continuing
business  relationships  throughout  the  industry,  which can be a  significant
competitive  advantage.   In  addition,  the  potential  for  securitization  of
reinsurance and insurance  risks through capital markets  provides an additional
source of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition.

EMPLOYEES
As of March 1, 2003, the Company employed 536 persons.  Management believes that
its employee relations are good. None of the Company's  employees are subject to
collective  bargaining  agreements,  and the Company is not aware of any current
efforts to implement such agreements.


REGULATORY MATTERS
The Company and its insurance  subsidiaries  are subject to regulation under the
insurance statutes of the various  jurisdictions in which they conduct business,
including essentially all states of the United States,  Canada,  Singapore,  the
United  Kingdom  and  Bermuda.  These  regulations  vary  from  jurisdiction  to
jurisdiction and are generally  designed to protect ceding  insurance  companies
and  policyholders  by regulating the Company's  conduct of business,  financial
integrity  and  ability  to  meet  its  obligations  relating  to  its  business
transactions  and operations.  Many of these  regulations  require  reporting of
information  designed  to allow  insurance  regulators  to closely  monitor  the
Company's performance.

INSURANCE  HOLDING COMPANY  REGULATION.  Under applicable United States laws and
regulations,  no person,  corporation  or other entity may acquire a controlling
interest in the Company, unless such person,  corporation or entity has obtained
the prior  approval for such  acquisition  from the Insurance  Commissioners  of
Delaware and the other states in which the Company's insurance  subsidiaries are
domiciled or deemed domiciled,  currently Arizona, California and Georgia. Under
these  laws,  "control"  is  presumed  when any  person  acquires,  directly  or
indirectly,  10% or more of the voting  securities of an insurance  company.  To
obtain the approval of any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file an
application with the relevant  insurance  commissioner  disclosing,  among other
things,  the  background of the acquirer and that of its directors and officers,
the acquirer's  financial  condition and its proposed  changes in the management
and  operations of the insurance  company.  U.S. state  regulators  also require
prior notice or  regulatory  approval of material  inter-affiliate  transactions
within the holding company structure. See "Dividends".

The  Insurance  Companies  Act of Canada  also  requires  prior  approval by the
Minister of Finance of anyone acquiring a significant  interest in an authorized
Canadian insurance company. In addition, the Company is subject to regulation by
the insurance  regulators of other states and foreign  jurisdictions in which it
does  business.  Certain  of  these  states  and  foreign  jurisdictions  impose
regulations  regulating  the  ability  of any  person to  acquire  control of an
insurance  company  authorized  to do  business  in  that  jurisdiction  without
appropriate regulatory approval similar to those described above.

DIVIDENDS.  Under Bermuda law,  Group is prohibited  from  declaring or paying a
dividend if such payment would reduce the  realizable  value of its assets to an
amount less than the  aggregate  value of its  liabilities  and its issued share
capital and share premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts. Group's ability
to pay  dividends  and  its  operating  expenses  is  partially  dependent  upon
dividends  from  its  subsidiaries.   The  payment  of  dividends  by  insurance
subsidiaries  is limited  under  Bermuda  law as well as the laws of the various
U.S. states in which Group's insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are licensed
to transact  business.  The  limitations are generally based upon net income and
compliance with applicable policyholders' surplus or minimum solvency margin and
liquidity  ratio  requirements  as determined  in  accordance  with the relevant
statutory accounting practices. As Holdings has outstanding debt obligations, it
is dependent  upon dividends and other  permissible  payments from its operating
subsidiaries to enable it to meet its debt and operating expense obligations and
to pay dividends to Group.

The payment of  dividends  to  Holdings by Everest Re is subject to  limitations
imposed by Delaware law. Generally, Everest Re may only pay dividends out of its
statutory  earned  surplus,  which was $921.0  million at December 31, 2002, and
only  after  it has  given  10  days  prior  notice  to the  Delaware  Insurance


Commissioner.  During this 10-day period,  the Commissioner may, by order, limit
or disallow  the payment of ordinary  dividends  if the  Commissioner  finds the
insurer to be  presently or  potentially  in financial  distress.  Further,  the
maximum  amount of dividends  that may be paid without the prior approval of the
Delaware Insurance Commissioner in any twelve month period is the greater of (1)
10% of an insurer's  statutory  surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year
or (2) the insurer's statutory net income, not including realized capital gains,
for the prior calendar year. Under this definition, the maximum amount that will
be  available  for the  payment  of  dividends  by  Everest  Re in 2003  without
triggering  the  requirement  for prior  approval of regulatory  authorities  in
connection with a dividend is $149.4 million.

Under Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is unable to declare or make payment of a dividend
if it fails to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a
long-term  insurer,  Bermuda Re is also  unable to declare or pay a dividend  to
anyone who is not a  policyholder  unless,  after payment of the  dividend,  the
value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as certified by its approved
actuary, exceeds its liabilities for long-term business by at least the $250,000
minimum  solvency margin.  Prior approval of the Bermuda  Monetary  Authority is
required if Bermuda Re's dividend payments would reduce its prior year-end total
statutory  capital by 15.0% or more.  At December 31,  2002,  Bermuda Re met its
solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant margin.

INSURANCE  REGULATION.  U.S. domestic property and casualty insurers,  including
reinsurers,  are subject to  regulation  by their state of domicile and by those
states in which they are  licensed.  The  regulation  of reinsurers is typically
related to the  reinsurer's  financial  condition,  investments,  management and
operation.  The rates and policy terms of  reinsurance  agreements are generally
not subject to direct regulation by any governmental authority.

The operations of Everest Re's foreign  branch offices in Canada,  Singapore and
the  United  Kingdom  are  subject to  regulation  by the  insurance  regulatory
officials of those  jurisdictions.  Management  believes  that the Company is in
material  compliance  with  applicable  laws and  regulations  pertaining to its
business and operations.

Bermuda Re is not admitted to do business as an insurer in any  jurisdiction  in
the U.S. Bermuda Re conducts its insurance business from its offices in Bermuda.
In Bermuda,  Bermuda Re is regulated by the  Insurance Act 1978 (as amended) and
related  regulations  (the "Act").  The Act  establishes  solvency and liquidity
standards,  auditing and reporting  requirements  and subjects Bermuda Re to the
supervision,  investigation  and  intervention  powers of the  Bermuda  Monetary
Authority.  Under the Act,  Bermuda  Re, as a Class 4 insurer,  is  required  to
maintain $100 million in statutory  capital and surplus,  to have an independent
auditor approved by the Bermuda Monetary  Authority  conduct an annual audit and
report  on its  statutory  financial  statements  and  filings  and to  have  an
appointed  loss  reserve  specialist  (also  approved  by the  Bermuda  Monetary
Authority) review and report on its loss reserves annually.

Bermuda  Re is also  registered  under  the Act as a  long-term  insurer  and is
thereby  authorized to write life and annuity business.  As a long-term insurer,
Bermuda Re is  required to maintain a long-term  business  fund,  to  separately
account for this business and to have an approved  actuary prepare a certificate
concerning its long-term business assets and liabilities to be filed annually.

Everest  Indemnity,  Everest  National,  Everest  Security and Mt.  McKinley are
subject to regulations similar to the U.S. regulations applicable to Everest Re.
In addition,  Everest National and Everest Security must comply with substantial
regulatory  requirements  in each  state  where  they  conduct  business.  These
additional  requirements  include,  but are not limited to, rate and policy form
requirements,   requirements  with  regard  to  licensing,  agent  appointments,
participation  in  residual  markets  and  claim  handling   procedures.   These
regulations are primarily designed for the protection of policyholders.


LICENSES.  Everest  Re  is a  licensed  property  and  casualty  insurer  and/or
reinsurer in all states  (except  Nevada and Wyoming),  the District of Columbia
and Puerto Rico. In New  Hampshire  and Puerto Rico,  Everest Re is licensed for
reinsurance only. Such licensing enables U.S. domestic ceding company clients to
take credit for reinsurance ceded to Everest Re.

Everest Re is licensed as a property  and casualty  reinsurer  in Canada.  It is
also  authorized  to conduct  reinsurance  business  in the United  Kingdom  and
Singapore.  Everest Re can also write  reinsurance  in other foreign  countries.
Because  some  jurisdictions  require a reinsurer  to register in order to be an
acceptable  market for local  insurers,  Everest Re is  registered  as a foreign
insurer and/or reinsurer in the following countries:  Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,
Colombia,  Ecuador,  El Salvador,  Guatemala,  Mexico,  Peru,  Venezuela and the
Philippines.  Everest  National  is  licensed  in 45 states and the  District of
Columbia.  Everest  Indemnity  is licensed in Delaware  and is eligible to write
insurance  on a surplus  lines basis in 48 states,  the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico.  Everest Security is licensed in Georgia and Alabama.  Mt. McKinley
is licensed in Delaware and  California.  Bermuda Re is  registered as a Class 4
insurer and a long-term insurer in Bermuda.

PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS.  Everest Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity, Everest
Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to periodic financial examination (usually
every 3 years) of their  affairs by the insurance  departments  of the states in
which  they are  licensed,  authorized  or  accredited.  Everest  Re's,  Everest
Security's, Everest Indemnity's and Mt. McKinley's last examination reports were
as of December 31, 2000,  while Everest  National's  last  examination was as of
December 31, 2001.  None of these  reports  contained  any material  findings or
recommendations.   In  addition,   U.S.  insurance   companies  are  subject  to
examinations by the various state insurance  departments where they are licensed
concerning compliance with applicable conduct of business regulations.

NAIC RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. The U.S. National Association of Insurance
Commissioners  ("NAIC")  employs a formula  to  measure  the  amount of  capital
appropriate for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall
business operations in light of its size and risk profile.  The major categories
of a company's risk profile are its asset risk,  credit risk,  and  underwriting
risk. The standards are an effort by the NAIC to prevent  insolvencies,  to ward
off other financial difficulties of insurance companies and to establish uniform
regulatory standards among state insurance departments.

Under the approved  formula,  a company's  statutory  surplus is compared to its
risk  based  capital  ("RBC").  If this ratio is above a minimum  threshold,  no
action is necessary.  Below this  threshold  are four distinct  action levels at
which a regulator  can intervene  with  increasing  degrees of authority  over a
domestic  insurer  as the  ratio  of  surplus  to  RBC  decreases.  The  mildest
intervention  requires  the company to submit a plan of  appropriate  corrective
actions.  The most severe  action  requires the company to be  rehabilitated  or
liquidated.

Based on their  financial  positions at December 31, 2002,  Everest Re,  Everest
National,  Everest Indemnity and Everest Security exceed the minimum thresholds.
Since Mt.  McKinley  ceased  writing  new and  renewal  insurance  in 1985,  its
domiciliary  regulator,  Delaware, has exempted Mt. McKinley from complying with
RBC requirements. Various proposals to change the RBC formula arise from time to
time.  The  Company  is unable to  predict  whether  any such  proposal  will be
adopted, the form in which any such proposals would be adopted or the effect, if
any, the adoption of any such proposal or change in the RBC  calculations  would
have on the Company.


CODIFICATION  OF  STATUTORY  ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES.  The NAIC has  published  a
codification of statutory accounting  principles,  which has been adopted by the
states  of  domicile  of the  Company's  U.S.  operating  subsidiaries  with  an
effective  date of January 1, 2001. On January 1, 2001,  significant  changes to
the  statutory-basis  of accounting became  effective.  The cumulative effect of
these changes in 2001 was  a  $57.1  million  increase to Everest Re's statutory
surplus.

TAX MATTERS.  The  following  summary of the taxation of the Company is based on
current  law.  There  can  be  no  assurances  that  legislative,  judicial,  or
administrative changes will not be enacted that materially affect this summary.

BERMUDA.  Under  current  Bermuda law, no income,  withholding  or capital gains
taxes are imposed upon Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries. Group and its Bermuda
subsidiaries  have  received  an  undertaking  from the  Minister  of Finance in
Bermuda  that,  in the event of any taxes being  imposed,  Group and its Bermuda
subsidiaries  will  be  exempt  from  taxation  in  Bermuda  until  March  2016.
Non-Bermuda  branches of Bermuda  subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the
jurisdictions in which they operate.

BARBADOS.  Group, a Bermuda  company with its principal  office in Barbados,  is
registered as an external  company under the Companies Act, Cap. 308 of Barbados
and  is  licensed  as an  international  business  company  under  the  Barbados
International  Business Companies Act, 1991-24. As a result, Group is subject to
a preferred  rate of  corporation  tax on profits  and gains in Barbados  and is
exempt from withholding tax on dividends, interest, royalties,  management fees,
fees or other  income  paid or deemed  paid to a person who is not  resident  in
Barbados or who, if so resident, carries on an international business. No tax is
imposed on capital gains.

UNITED STATES.  Group's U.S. subsidiaries conduct business in and are subject to
taxation  in the United  States.  Non-U.S.  branches  of U.S.  subsidiaries  are
subject to local taxation in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Should the
U.S. subsidiaries  distribute current or accumulated earnings and profits in the
form of  dividends  or  otherwise  to Group,  the  Company  would be  subject to
withholding  taxes.  Group and its Bermuda  subsidiaries  believe that they have
operated and will continue to operate  their  business in a manner that will not
cause them to generate income treated as effectively  connected with the conduct
of a trade or business within the United States.  On this basis,  Group does not
expect  that it and  its  Bermuda  subsidiaries  will be  required  to pay  U.S.
corporate income taxes other than withholding taxes on certain investment income
and premium  excise  taxes.  If Group or Bermuda Re were subject to U.S.  income
tax,  there  could be a  material  adverse  effect  on the  Company's  financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION
The  Company's  Annual  Reports  on Form 10-K,  Quarterly  Reports on Form 10-Q,
Current  Reports on Form 8-K,  proxy  statements and amendments to those reports
are  available  free  of  charge  through  the  Company's  internet  website  at
HTTP://WWW.EVERESTRE.COM  as soon as reasonably  practicable  after such reports
are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
Everest Re's corporate offices are located in approximately  115,000 square feet
of leased office space in Liberty  Corner,  New Jersey.  Bermuda Re's  corporate
offices are located in  approximately  3,600 total square feet of leased  office


space in Hamilton,  Bermuda. The Company's other twelve locations occupy a total
of  approximately  64,000  square  feet,  all of which  are  leased.  Management
believes that the  above-described  office space is adequate for its current and
anticipated needs.

ITEM 3. LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS
In the  ordinary  course of  business,  the  Company is  involved  in  lawsuits,
arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute  resolution  procedures,  the
outcomes of which will  determine the  Company's  rights and  obligations  under
insurance and reinsurance  agreements and other more general contracts.  In some
disputes,  the Company  seeks to enforce  its rights  under an  agreement  or to
collect funds owing to it. In other matters,  the Company is resisting  attempts
by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. Such disputes are resolved
through formal and informal means, including litigation and arbitration.

In all such  matters,  the Company  believes  that its positions are legally and
commercially  reasonable.  The Company also regularly evaluates those positions,
and where appropriate,  establishes or adjusts insurance reserves to reflect its
evaluation.  The Company's  aggregate reserves take into account the possibility
that the Company may not ultimately  prevail in each and every disputed  matter.
The Company believes its aggregate reserves reduce the potential that an adverse
resolution of one or more of these matters,  at any point in time,  would have a
material impact on the Company's  financial  condition or results of operations.
However,  there can be no assurances that adverse resolutions of such matters in
any one period or in the aggregate will not result in a material  adverse effect
on the Company's results of operations.

The Company does not believe  that there are any other  material  pending  legal
proceedings  to which it or any of its  subsidiaries  or  their  properties  are
subject.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
None.


PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS

MARKET INFORMATION
The  common  shares  of Group  trade on the New York  Stock  Exchange  under the
symbol,  "RE".  Quarterly  high and low market  prices of the  Company's  common
shares in 2002 and 2001 were as follows:




NUMBER OF HOLDERS OF COMMON SHARES
The number of record  holders of common  shares as of March 1, 2003 was 68. That
number  excludes the  beneficial  owners of shares held in "street" name or held
through participants in depositories, such as The Depository Trust Company.

DIVIDEND  HISTORY AND  RESTRICTIONS  In 1995, the Board of Directors of Holdings
established a policy of declaring  regular quarterly cash dividends and has paid
a regular  quarterly  dividend in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 1995.
The Company  declared and paid its regular  quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per
share for each  quarter of 2001 and $0.08 per share for each  quarter of 2002. A
committee of the Company's  Board of Directors  declared a dividend of $0.09 per
share, payable on or before March 21, 2003 to shareholders of record on March 3,
2003.

The declaration and payment of future dividends,  if any, by the Company will be
at the  discretion  of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors,
including the Company's earnings, financial condition, business needs and growth
objectives,  capital and surplus  requirements  of its  operating  subsidiaries,
regulatory  restrictions,  rating agency considerations and other factors. As an
insurance holding company,  the Company is partially  dependent on dividends and
other  permitted  payments from its  subsidiaries  to pay cash  dividends to its
stockholders.  The payment of  dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by
Everest Re is subject to  Delaware  regulatory  restrictions  and the payment of
dividends to Group by Bermuda Re will be subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory
restrictions.  See  "Regulatory  Matters -  Dividends"  and Note 13A of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

The  following  is a  discussion  of the  results of  operations  and  financial
condition of Everest Re Group,  Ltd. and its  subsidiaries.  This discussion and
analysis  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated   financial
statements and the notes thereto presented under ITEM 8.

RESTRUCTURING
On February 24, 2000, a corporate  restructuring  was  completed  and Everest Re
Group,  Ltd.  ("Group")  became  the  new  parent  holding  company  of  Everest
Reinsurance Holdings,  Inc. ("Holdings"),  which remains the holding company for
Group's U.S. based  operations.  The "Company" means Group and its subsidiaries,
except when  referring  to periods  prior to February  24,  2000,  when it means
Holdings and its subsidiaries.

ACQUISITIONS
On September 19, 2000,  Holdings  completed the acquisition of all of the issued
and outstanding  capital stock of Gibraltar Casualty Company  ("Gibraltar") from
The  Prudential  Insurance  Company  of  America  ("The  Prudential")  for $51.8
million,  which  approximated  book  value.  As a  result  of  the  acquisition,
Gibraltar  became  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Holdings  and,  immediately
following  the  acquisition,  its name was  changed  to Mt.  McKinley  Insurance
Company ("Mt.  McKinley").  In connection with the acquisition of Mt.  McKinley,
which has significant exposure to asbestos and environmental claims,  Prudential
Property  and  Casualty  Insurance  Company  ("Prupac"),  a  subsidiary  of  The
Prudential,  provided  reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million)
of the  first  $200.0  million  of any  adverse  development  of Mt.  McKinley's
reserves as of  September  19,  2000.  In addition,  The  Prudential  guaranteed
Prupac's obligation to Mt. McKinley.  There were $78.9 million of cessions under
this  reinsurance at December 31, 2002,  reducing the limit available under this
contract to $81.1 million.

In connection with the Mt. McKinley acquisition,  Prupac also provided excess of
loss  reinsurance  for 100% of the first $8.5  million  of loss with  respect to
certain  of  Mt.   McKinley's   retrocessions   and  potentially   uncollectible
reinsurance coverage. There were $0.0 million and $3.6 million of cessions under
this  reinsurance  during  the  periods  ending  December  31,  2002  and  2001,
respectively, reducing the limit available under the contract to $2.4 million.

Mt. McKinley,  a run-off property and casualty insurer in the United States, has
had a long  relationship  with  Holdings and its  principal  operating  company,
Everest  Reinsurance  Company ("Everest Re"). Mt. McKinley was formed in 1978 by
Everest Re and wrote  insurance  until 1985,  when it was placed in run-off.  In
1991, Mt. McKinley became a subsidiary of The Prudential. Mt. McKinley is also a
reinsurer  of Everest Re.  Under a series of  transactions  dating to 1986,  Mt.
McKinley reinsured several  components of Everest Re's business.  In particular,
Mt. McKinley provided stop-loss reinsurance  protection,  in connection with the
Company's  October  5,  1995  initial  public  offering,  for any  adverse  loss
development  on Everest Re's June 30, 1995  (December  31, 1994 for  catastrophe
losses) reserves, with $375.0 million in limits, of which $103.9 million remains
available  (the  "Stop  Loss  Agreement").  The Stop  Loss  Agreement  and other
reinsurance  contracts  between  Mt.  McKinley  and  Everest Re remain in effect
following the acquisition.  However,  these contracts became  transactions  with
affiliates  effective  on the date of the Mt.  McKinley  acquisition,  and their
financial impact is thereafter eliminated in consolidation.  Effective September
19, 2000,  Mt.  McKinley and Bermuda Re entered into a loss  portfolio  transfer
reinsurance  agreement,  whereby Mt. McKinley  transferred,  for what management
believes to be arm's-length  consideration,  all of its net insurance  exposures
and reserves to Bermuda Re.


During 2000, the Company completed two additional acquisitions, Everest Security
Insurance Company ("Everest Security"),  formerly known as Southeastern Security
Insurance  Company,  a United States property and casualty company whose primary
business  is  non-standard  automobile  insurance,   and  Everest  International
Reinsurance,  Ltd. ("Everest International"),  formerly known as AFC Re, Ltd., a
Bermuda based life and annuity reinsurer.

INDUSTRY CONDITIONS
The worldwide  reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive,  yet
cyclical by product and market. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 (the
"September 11 attacks")  resulted in losses which reduced industry  capacity and
were of sufficient  magnitude to cause most  companies to reassess their capital
position,  tolerance for risk, exposure control mechanisms and the pricing terms
and  conditions  at which they are  willing  to take on risk.  The  gradual  and
variable improving trend that had been apparent through 2000 and earlier in 2001
firmed significantly after the September 11 attacks. This firming generally took
the  form  of  immediate  and  significant  upward  pressure  on  prices,   more
restrictive terms and conditions and a reduction of coverage limits and capacity
availability.  Such pressures were widespread, with variability depending on the
product and markets involved, but mainly depending on the characteristics of the
underlying risk exposures. The magnitude of the changes was sufficient to create
temporary  disequilibrium  in some  markets as  individual  buyers  and  sellers
adapted to changes in both their internal and market dynamics.

During 2002,  the  reinsurance  and insurance  markets  continued to firm.  This
firming  reflects the losses  arising  from the  September 11 attacks as well as
reactions to broad and growing  recognition  that  competition in the late 1990s
reached extremes in many classes and markets, which ultimately led to inadequate
pricing and overly broad terms,  conditions and  coverages.  The effect of these
extremes,  which is becoming apparent through  excessive loss emergence,  varies
widely by company depending on product offerings, markets accessed, underwriting
and operating practices, competitive strategies and business volumes. Across all
market  participants  however,  the aggregate effect has been impaired financial
results and erosion of the industry  capital  base.  Coupled with  deteriorating
investment  market  conditions  and  results,  and  renewed  concerns  regarding
longer-term  industry specific issues,  including  asbestos exposure and sub-par
capital returns,  these financial  impacts have introduced  substantial,  and in
some  cases  extreme,  pressure  for  the  initiation  and/or  strengthening  of
corrective  action by  individual  market  participants.  These  pressures  have
resulted in firming prices,  more restrictive terms and conditions and tightened
coverage availability across most classes and markets.

These  changes  reflect a clear  reversal of the general trend from 1987 through
1999 toward increasingly  competitive global market conditions across most lines
of business as reflected by decreasing prices and broadening contract terms. The
earlier  trend  resulted  from a number of factors,  including  the emergence of
significant  reinsurance  capacity  in Bermuda,  changes in the Lloyd's  market,
consolidation  and increased  capital  levels in the  insurance and  reinsurance
industries,  as well as the emergence of new reinsurance and financial  products
addressing traditional exposures in alternative fashions.  Many of these factors
continue to exist and have taken on  additional  importance as the result of the
firming  conditions  which have  emerged.  As a result,  although the Company is
encouraged by the recent  improvements  and, more  generally,  by current market
conditions, the Company cannot predict with any reasonable certainty whether and
to what extent these improvements will persist.


SEGMENT INFORMATION
The  Company,  through  its  subsidiaries,   operates  in  five  segments:  U.S.
Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting,  International and Bermuda.
The U.S. Reinsurance  operation writes property and casualty reinsurance on both
a treaty and facultative basis through  reinsurance  brokers as well as directly
with ceding companies  within the United States.  The U.S.  Insurance  operation
writes  property  and  casualty   insurance   primarily  through  general  agent
relationships and surplus lines brokers within the United States.  The Specialty
Underwriting operation writes accident and health ("A&H"),  marine, aviation and
surety  business  within the United  States and  worldwide  through  brokers and
directly with ceding companies.  The International operation writes property and
casualty  reinsurance  through the  Company's  branches in London,  Canada,  and
Singapore,  in addition to foreign  business  written  through the Company's New
Jersey  headquarters  and Miami office.  The Bermuda  operation writes property,
casualty,  life and annuity  business  through  brokers and directly with ceding
companies.

These  segments  are  managed in a  carefully  coordinated  fashion  with strong
elements of central control, including with respect to capital,  investments and
support operations. As a result, management monitors and evaluates the financial
performance  of  these   operating   segments   principally   based  upon  their
underwriting results. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate  reinsurance but such
reinsurance  does not  impact  segment  results,  since  business  is  generally
reported within the segment in which the business was first produced.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Unusual  Loss  Events in 2001.  As a result of the  September  11  attacks,  the
Company  incurred  pre-tax  losses,  based on an estimate  of ultimate  exposure
developed through a review of its coverages,  which totaled $213.2 million gross
of  reinsurance  and $55.0  million  net of  reinsurance.  Associated  with this
reinsurance were $60.0 million of pre-tax charges, predominantly from adjustment
premiums,  resulting in a total  pre-tax  loss from the  September 11 attacks of
$115.0 million.  After tax recoveries relating specifically to this unusual loss
event,  the net loss from the September 11 attacks  totaled $75.0 million.  Over
90% of the losses  ceded by the Company  were  pursuant to  treaties,  where the
reinsurers'  obligations  are  secured,  which the Company  believes  eliminates
material reinsurance collection risk.

As a result  of the Enron  bankruptcy  in 2001,  the  Company  incurred  losses,
after-tax and net of reinsurance,  amounting to $25.0 million. This unusual loss
reflects all of the Company's exposures to this event,  including  underwriting,
credit and investment.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001
Premiums.  Gross premiums  written  increased 51.8% to $2,846.5  million in 2002
from $1,874.6  million in 2001, as the Company took advantage of selected growth
opportunities  and  improving  pricing  in  many  classes  of  business,   while
continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. Premium growth areas
included a 303.8%  ($76.0  million)  increase  in the Bermuda  operation,  which
continues  to expand  its  product  line  offerings,  a 67.6%  ($218.1  million)
increase in the International  operation,  mainly  attributable to growth in the
London,  Canadian and Latin American markets,  a 63.5% ($319.1 million) increase
in the U.S. Insurance operation,  principally attributable to growth in worker's
compensation   insurance,   a  46.5%  ($284.1  million)  increase  in  the  U.S.
Reinsurance operation,  primarily reflecting growth across property and casualty
lines,  and an 18.0%  ($74.6  million)  increase in the  Specialty  Underwriting
operation,  mainly  attributable  to  growth  in  marine,  aviation  and  surety
business.  The  Company  continued  to  decline  business  that did not meet its
objectives regarding underwriting profitability.


Ceded premiums  decreased to $208.9 million in 2002 from $314.5 million in 2001.
This decrease was principally attributable to a reduction in cessions made under
the  Company's  corporate  retrocessional  program  and to a  decrease  in ceded
premiums  in the  U.S.  Insurance  operation  as a  result  of  changes  in this
segment's specific  reinsurance  programs.  Ceded premiums in 2002 included $5.1
million and $49.4 million in adjustment  premiums  relating to claims made under
the 2001  and 2000  accident  year  aggregate  excess  of loss  elements  of the
Company's corporate  retrocessional  programs,  respectively.  Ceded premiums in
2001 included $81.3 million and $58.1 million in adjustment premiums relating to
claims  made  under the 2001 and 1999  accident  year  aggregate  excess of loss
elements of the Company's corporate retrocessional programs,  respectively, with
the 2001  accident year cessions  principally  relating to losses  incurred as a
result of the September 11 attacks and Enron bankruptcy.

Net  premiums  written  increased  by 69.1% to  $2,637.6  million  in 2002  from
$1,560.1  million in 2001.  This  increase was a result of the increase in gross
premiums written and the decrease in ceded premiums.

PREMIUM REVENUES.  Net premiums earned increased by 54.9% to $2,273.7 million in
2002 from $1,467.5 million in 2001.  Contributing to this increase were a 154.4%
($25.3  million)  increase in the Bermuda  operation,  a 94.8% ($278.8  million)
increase in the U.S. Insurance  operation,  a 64.4% ($185.1 million) increase in
the  International  operation,  a 46.0%  ($228.8  million)  increase in the U.S.
Reinsurance  operation  and a 23.7% ($88.2  million)  increase in the  Specialty
Underwriting   operation.   All  of  these  changes  reflect  period  to  period
variability in gross written and ceded premiums and business mix,  together with
normal variability in earnings patterns.  Business mix changes occur not only as
the Company shifts emphasis between  products,  lines of business,  distribution
channels and markets but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost
always with changes in coverage,  structure,  prices  and/or  terms,  and as new
contracts are accepted with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different
from those of expiring contracts. As premium reporting and earnings and loss and
commission  characteristics  derive from the provisions of individual contracts,
the  continuous  turnover of individual  contracts,  arising from both strategic
shifts  and  day  to  day  underwriting,  can  and  does  introduce  appreciable
background variability in various underwriting line items.

EXPENSES.  Incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses ("LAE") increased by 34.7%
to  $1,629.4  million in 2002 from  $1,209.5  million in 2001.  The  increase in
incurred  losses and LAE was  principally  attributable  to the  increase in net
premiums earned and modest reserve  strengthening in select areas,  most notably
in directors and officers liability, surety and workers' compensation lines, and
with respect to asbestos exposures, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses
and improvements in rates, terms and conditions in many classes of business,  as
well as the impact of changes in the Company's mix of business.  Incurred losses
and LAE include  catastrophe  losses,  which  reflect the impact both of current
period events and favorable and  unfavorable  development on prior period events
and are net of reinsurance. A catastrophe is an event that causes a pre-tax loss
on property  exposures of at least $5.0 million and has an event date of January
1, 1988 or later.  Catastrophe  losses,  net of contract  specific  cessions but
before cessions under the corporate  retrocessional  program, were $30.2 million
in 2002,  principally  relating to European flood losses and Hurricanes  Isidore
and Kenna,  compared to net catastrophe  losses of $222.6 million in 2001, which
was principally related to the September 11 attacks.  Incurred losses and LAE in
2002 reflected  ceded losses and LAE of $287.7 million  compared to ceded losses
and LAE in 2001 of $486.3  million.  The ceded  losses and LAE in 2002  included
$11.0 million and $90.0 million of losses ceded under the 2001 and 2000 accident
year   aggregate   excess  of  loss   components  of  the  Company's   corporate
retrocessional program,  respectively. The ceded losses and LAE in 2001 included
$164.0  million  and  $105.0  million  of losses  ceded  under the 2001 and 1999
accident year  aggregate  excess of loss  components of the Company's  corporate


retrocessional  program,  respectively,  with the 2001  accident  year  cessions
relating  principally  to losses  incurred  as the  result of the  September  11
attacks.

Contributing to the increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2002 from 2001 were a
242.3% ($36.7 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, principally reflecting
reserve  strengthening  with  respect to Mt.  McKinley  asbestos  exposures  and
increased  premium  volume,  a  104.9%  ($221.6  million)  increase  in the U.S.
Insurance  operation,  principally  reflecting  increased premium volume coupled
with changes in this segment's  specific  reinsurance  programs,  a 45.8% ($92.8
million)  increase  in  the  International  operation,   principally  reflecting
increased  premium  volume  and a 19.2%  ($86.3  million)  increase  in the U.S.
Reinsurance  operation,  principally due to increased premium volume,  partially
offset by decreased catastrophe losses. These increases were partially offset by
a 5.3%  ($17.5  million)  decrease  in  the  Specialty  Underwriting  operation,
principally  attributable to decreased  catastrophe losses.  Incurred losses and
LAE for each operation were also impacted by variability  relating to changes in
the level of premium volume and mix of business by class and type.

The Company's loss and LAE ratio ("loss ratio"), which is calculated by dividing
incurred losses and LAE by premiums earned,  decreased by 10.7 percentage points
to 71.7% in 2002 from 82.4% in 2001,  reflecting the earned premium and incurred
losses and LAE discussed  above.  The following  table shows the loss ratios for
each of the Company's  operating segments for 2002 and 2001. The loss ratios for
all  operations  were impacted by the expense  factors noted above as well as by
the impact on ceded  premiums of the  adjustment  premiums  under the  Company's
corporate retrocessional program.



Underwriting  expenses  increased by 36.4% to $621.7 million in 2002 from $455.7
million  in 2001.  Commission,  brokerage,  taxes and fees  increased  by $155.0
million,  principally  reflecting increases in premium volume and changes in the
mix of business.  Other underwriting  expenses increased by $11.0 million as the
Company  expanded  its  operations  to support its  increased  business  volume.
Contributing to the  underwriting  expense  increase were a 95.6% ($4.0 million)
increase in the Bermuda operation,  a 79.7% ($65.9 million) increase in the U.S.
Insurance  operation,  a 31.9%  ($29.8  million)  increase in the  International
operation,  a 27.0% ($29.1  million)  increase in the Specialty  operation and a
22.8% ($37.4 million) increase in the U.S.  Reinsurance  operation.  The changes
for each operation's  expenses  principally  resulted from changes in commission
expenses related to changes in premium volume and business mix by class and type
and, in some cases, the underwriting performance of the underlying business. The
Company's expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing  underwriting  expenses
by premiums earned, decreased by 3.8 percentage points to 27.3% in 2002 compared
to 31.1% in 2001.

The Company's  combined ratio,  which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios,
decreased by 14.5 percentage points to 99.0% in 2002 compared to 113.5% in 2001.


The  following  table  shows  the  combined  ratios  for  each of the  Company's
operating  segments for 2002 and 2001.  The combined  ratios for all  operations
were impacted by the loss and expense ratio  variability  noted above as well as
by the impact on ceded premiums of the  adjustment  premiums under the Company's
corporate retrocessional program.



INVESTMENTS.  Net investment  income increased by 3.0% to $350.6 million in 2002
from $340.4 million in 2001,  principally reflecting the effect of investing the
$736.1  million  of cash flow from  operations  in 2002,  $346.3  million of net
proceeds from the offering of common shares in February 2002 and $203.4  million
of net proceeds from Everest Re Capital Trust's  ("Capital  Trust")  issuance of
trust  preferred  securities  in November  2002,  partially  offset by the lower
interest rate  environment.  The  following  table shows a comparison of various
investment  yields as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively,  and for the
periods then ended.



Net realized  capital  losses were $50.0  million in 2002,  reflecting  realized
capital losses on the Company's  investments of $142.8  million,  which includes
$101.3 million  relating to write-downs in the value of securities  deemed to be
impaired  on an other than  temporary  basis,  of which $33.0  million  were for
WorldCom,  partially offset by $92.8 million of realized capital gains, compared
to net  realized  capital  losses of $22.3  million  in 2001.  The net  realized
capital losses in 2001 reflected realized capital losses of $55.1 million, which
included $22.6 million relating to write-downs in the value of securities deemed
to be impaired on an other than temporary basis,  which were partially offset by
$32.8 million of realized capital gains.

Interest  expense was $42.4 million for 2002 compared to $46.0 million for 2001.
Interest  expense for 2002 reflects $38.9 million  relating to Holdings'  senior
notes and $3.5  million  relating to  Holdings'  borrowing  under its  revolving
credit  facility.  Interest  expense for 2001 reflects $38.9 million relating to
Holdings'  senior notes and $7.1 million  relating to Holdings'  borrowing under
its revolving credit facility.  In addition,  2002 includes  incurred expense of
$2.1 million for distributions on Capital Trust's trust preferred securities.

Other expense was $2.1 million in 2002 compared to other income of $28.2 million
in 2001. Significant contributors to other expense in 2002 were foreign exchange
losses,  normal provision for uncollectible  audit premium in the U.S. Insurance


operation  and the  amortization  of deferred  expenses  relating  to  Holdings'
issuance  of senior  notes  and  Capital  Trust's  issuance  of trust  preferred
securities, partially offset by fee income. Other income for 2001 includes $25.9
million  arising from a  non-recurring  receipt of shares in connection with the
demutualization  of a former insurance  company client that had issued annuities
to the Company in connection  with certain  claim  settlement  transactions.  In
addition,  other income for 2001 includes  foreign exchange gains as well as fee
income,  offset by the amortization of deferred  expenses  relating to Holdings'
issuance of senior notes.

The  Company  has a small  number of credit  default  swaps,  which it no longer
writes,  and  specialized  equity put  options in its product  portfolio.  These
products  meet  the  definition  of  a  derivative  under  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  133,   "Accounting   for  Derivative   Instruments  and  Hedging
Activities"   ("FAS  133").   Net  derivative   expense  from  these  derivative
transactions in 2002,  essentially  reflecting  changes in fair value, was $14.5
million, principally relating to the specialized equity put options, compared to
$12.2 million in 2001,  principally  relating to the credit default  swaps.  Net
after tax exposure  remaining on the credit default  agreements is $3.1 million.
See also Footnote 2 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

INCOME TAXES. The Company  generated income tax expense of $30.7 million in 2002
compared to income tax benefits of $8.7 million in 2001. The tax expense in 2002
was mainly attributable to improved underwriting and investment results. The tax
benefit in 2001  primarily  resulted  from the impact of losses  relating to the
September  11  attacks,   the  Enron  bankruptcy  and  realized  capital  losses
recognized in 2001,  which reduced taxable income,  partially  offset by taxable
income  relating to the  non-recurring  receipt of shares in  connection  with a
former client's demutualization.

NET INCOME.  Net income was $231.3  million in 2002 compared to $99.0 million in
2001. This increase generally reflects the improved  underwriting and investment
results,  partially  offset by increased tax expense,  realized  capital losses,
derivative expense and a reduction in other income.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000
Premiums.  Gross premiums  written  increased 35.3% to $1,874.6  million in 2001
from $1,385.6  million in 2000, as the Company took advantage of selected growth
opportunities, while continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach.
Premium growth areas included a 115.9% ($13.4  million)  increase in the Bermuda
operation,  a 100.6% ($251.9 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance  operation,
principally  attributable to growth in worker's compensation  insurance, a 30.1%
($95.7  million)  increase  in  the  Specialty  Underwriting  operation,  mainly
attributable  to growth in A&H medical stop loss  writings,  and a 26.7% ($128.8
million)  increase  in the  U.S.  Reinsurance  operation,  primarily  reflecting
improved  market  conditions.  These  increases were partially  offset by a 0.2%
($0.8 million) decrease in the International operation. The Company continued to
decline  business  that  did not  meet  its  objectives  regarding  underwriting
profitability.

Ceded premiums  increased to $314.5 million in 2001 from $166.7 million in 2000.
This  increase  was  principally  attributable  to $81.3  million of  adjustment
premiums  incurred under the 2001 accident year aggregate excess of loss element
of the Company's corporate retrocessional program relating to losses incurred as
a result of the  September  11 attacks and the Enron  bankruptcy.  In  addition,
ceded  premiums  for 2001 and 2000 also  include  adjustment  premiums  of $58.1
million and $35.2 million, respectively,  relating to claims made under the 1999
accident  year  aggregate  excess of loss  element  of the  Company's  corporate
retrocessional program. The increase in ceded premiums in 2001 also reflects the
impact  on the  U.S.  Insurance  operation's  specific  reinsurance  protections
resulting from this segment's volume increase.


Net  premiums  written  increased  by 28.0% to  $1,560.1  million  in 2001  from
$1,218.9  million in 2000.  This  increase was a result of the increase in gross
premiums written and the increase in ceded premiums.

PREMIUM REVENUES.  Net premiums earned increased by 25.0% to $1,467.5 million in
2001 from $1,174.2 million in 2000.  Contributing to this increase were a 189.7%
($192.6  million)  increase  in the  U.S.  Insurance  operation,  a 41.6%  ($4.8
million) increase in the Bermuda operation,  a 22.9% ($69.2 million) increase in
the Specialty  Underwriting  operation,  a 5.5% ($26.0 million)  increase in the
U.S.   Reinsurance   operation  and  a  0.2%  ($0.7  million)  increase  in  the
International   operation.  All  of  these  changes  reflect  period  to  period
variability in gross written and ceded premiums, and business mix, together with
normal variability in earnings patterns.  Business mix changes occur not only as
the Company shifts emphasis between  products,  lines of business,  distribution
channels and markets but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost
always with changes in coverage,  structure,  prices  and/or  terms,  and as new
contracts are accepted with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different
from those of expiring contracts. As premium reporting and earnings and loss and
commission  characteristics  derive from the provisions of individual contracts,
the  continuous  turnover of individual  contracts,  arising from both strategic
shifts  and  day  to  day  underwriting,  can  and  does  introduce  appreciable
background variability in various underwriting line items.

EXPENSES.  Incurred loss and LAE increased by 36.7% to $1,209.5  million in 2001
from  $884.6  million  in 2000.  The  increase  in  incurred  losses and LAE was
principally  attributable  to an increase in business volume as reflected by the
increase in net premiums  earned,  the impact of incurred losses relating to the
September 11 attacks and the Enron  bankruptcy and modest reserve  strengthening
in select  areas,  together  with the impact of changes in the  Company's mix of
business.  The Enron bankruptcy  contributed  $34.0 million of unusual losses in
2001 before cessions under the corporate retrocessional program. Incurred losses
and LAE include  catastrophe  losses,  which  reflect the impact of both current
period events and favorable and  unfavorable  development on prior period events
and are net of reinsurance. A catastrophe is an event that causes a pre-tax loss
on property  exposures of at least $5.0 million and has an event date of January
1, 1988 or later.  Catastrophe  losses,  net of contract  specific  cessions but
before cessions under the corporate  retrocessional program in 2001, were $222.6
million,  relating  principally  to the  September  11 attacks,  tropical  storm
Alison, the Petrobras Oil Rig loss and the El Salvador  earthquake,  compared to
$13.9 million in 2000.  Incurred  losses and LAE in 2001 reflected  ceded losses
and LAE of $486.3  million  compared  to ceded  losses and LAE in 2000 of $161.6
million, with the increase principally  attributable to cessions relating to the
September 11 attack losses and the Enron bankruptcy, together with the increased
cessions  under  specific   reinsurance   arrangements  in  the  U.S.  Insurance
operation.  The ceded losses and LAE for 2001 reflect  $164.0  million of losses
ceded under the 2001 accident  year  aggregate  excess of loss  component of the
Company's corporate  retrocessional  program.  The ceded losses and LAE for 2001
and 2000 reflect $105.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively, of losses ceded
under the 1999 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company's
corporate  retrocessional  program,  with the amounts in both periods reflecting
reserve  strengthening in select lines,  including with respect to 1999 accident
year catastrophes.

Contributing to the increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2001 from 2000 were a
200.7% ($141.0 million) increase in the U.S.  Insurance  operation,  principally
reflecting  increased  premium volume,  a 137.5% ($8.8 million)  increase in the
Bermuda  operation,  principally  reflecting  increased  premium volume, a 41.5%
($131.9  million)  increase  in  the  U.S.  Reinsurance  operation,  principally


reflecting losses in connection with the September 11 attacks and tropical storm
Alison  and a 30.1%  ($76.5  million)  increase  in the  Specialty  Underwriting
operation,  principally  attributable to increased premium volume in A&H medical
stop loss business together with marine,  aviation and surety losses relating to
the September 11 attacks,  the Enron  bankruptcy and the Petrobras Oil Rig loss.
These increases were partially offset by a 14.1% ($33.3 million) decrease in the
International  operation,  principally  due to more favorable  loss  experience.
Incurred  losses and LAE for each  operation  were also impacted by  variability
relating to changes in the level of premium  volume and mix of business by class
and type.

The Company's loss and LAE ratio ("loss ratio"), which is calculated by dividing
incurred losses and LAE by premiums earned,  increased by 7.1 percentage  points
to 82.4% in 2001 from  75.3% in 2000,  reflecting  the  incurred  losses and LAE
discussed  above.  The  following  table  shows the loss  ratios for each of the
Company's  operating  segments  for  2001 and  2000.  The  loss  ratios  for all
operations  were  impacted by the expense  factors noted above as well as by the
impact  on  ceded  premiums  of the  adjustment  premiums  under  the  Company's
corporate retrocessional program.



Underwriting  expenses  increased by 40.6% to $455.7 million in 2001 from $324.1
million  in 2000.  Commission,  brokerage,  taxes and fees  increased  by $124.4
million,  principally  reflecting increases in premium volume and changes in the
mix of  business.  In  addition,  in 2000,  the  Company's  reassessment  of the
expected  losses  on a  multi-year  reinsurance  treaty  led to a $33.8  million
decrease in  contingent  commissions  with a  corresponding  increase to losses.
Other  underwriting  expenses  increased by $7.3 million as the Company expanded
its business volume and operations.  Contributing  to the  underwriting  expense
increase were a 122.7% ($45.6 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation,
mainly  relating  to the  increased  premium  volume,  a 70.8%  ($68.0  million)
increase in the U.S.  Reinsurance  operation,  which  included the impact of the
contingent  commission  adjustment  noted  above,  and a 22.5%  ($19.8  million)
increase in the Specialty operation.  These increases were partially offset by a
29.0% ($1.7 million) decrease in the Bermuda operation and a 1.5% ($1.4 million)
decrease in the International  operation.  Except as noted, the changes for each
operation's  expenses  principally  resulted from changes in commission expenses
related to changes in premium  volume and business mix by class and type and, in
some  cases,  the  underwriting  performance  of the  underlying  business.  The
Company's expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing  underwriting  expenses
by premiums earned, increased by 3.5 percentage points to 31.1% in 2001 compared
to 27.6% in 2000.

The Company's  combined ratio,  which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios,
increased  by 10.6  percentage  points to 113.5% in 2001  compared  to 102.9% in
2000.  The following  table shows the combined  ratios for each of the Company's
operating  segments for 2001 and 2000.  The combined  ratios for all  operations
were impacted by the loss and expense ratio  variability  noted above as well as
by the impact on ceded premiums of the  adjustment  premiums under the Company's
corporate retrocessional program.




INVESTMENTS.  Net investment income increased by 12.9% to $340.4 million in 2001
from $301.5 million in 2000,  principally reflecting the effect of investing the
$406.0  million of cash flow from  operations in 2001,  partially  offset by the
lower interest rate  environment  and increased  interest  expense on funds held
relating to the utilization of the 1999 and 2001 accident year aggregate  excess
of loss elements of the corporate  retrocessional  program.  The following table
shows a  comparison  of various  investment  yields as of December  31, 2001 and
2000, respectively, and for the periods then ended.



Net realized  capital  losses were $22.3  million in 2001,  reflecting  realized
capital losses on the Company's  investments  of $55.1  million,  which includes
$22.6 million  relating to write-downs  in the value of securities  deemed to be
impaired on an other than temporary basis,  partially offset by $32.8 million of
realized  capital gains,  compared to realized  capital gains of $0.8 million in
2000. The net realized capital gains in 2000 reflected realized capital gains of
$30.9 million,  which were partially offset by $30.1 million of realized capital
losses.  The net  realized  capital  losses  for 2001  allowed  the  Company  to
recapture  taxes  paid on net  realized  capital  gains  in prior  periods.  The
realized  capital  gains in 2001 and 2000  arose  mainly  from  activity  in the
Company's equity  portfolio.  The realized capital losses in 2001 and 2000 arose
mainly from activity in the Company's fixed maturity portfolios.

Interest  expense was $46.0  million for 2001 compared to $39.4 million in 2000.
Interest  expense for 2001 reflects $38.9 million  relating to Holdings'  senior
notes and $7.1  million  relating to  Holdings'  borrowing  under its  revolving
credit  facility.  Interest  expense for 2000 reflects $30.9 million relating to
Holdings'  senior notes and $8.5 million  relating to Holdings'  borrowing under
its revolving credit facility.

Other income was $28.2 million in 2001  compared to $3.3 million in 2000.  Other
income for 2001 includes $25.9 million arising from a  non-recurring  receipt of
shares in connection  with the  demutualization  of a former  insurance  company
client that had issued annuities to the Company in connection with certain claim
settlement  transactions.  In addition,  other income for 2001 includes  foreign
exchange  gains as well as financing fees from Everest  Security,  offset by the
amortization  of  deferred  expenses  relating to  Holdings'  issuance of senior
notes.  Significant  contributors to other income for 2000 were foreign exchange


gains as well as financing fees from Everest  Security,  partially offset by net
derivative  expense  and the  amortization  of  deferred  expenses  relating  to
Holdings'  issuance of senior notes.  The foreign  exchange gains and losses are
attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

During 2000 and 2001, the Company added to its product  portfolio a small number
of credit default swaps,  which it no longer writes,  and specialized equity put
options.  These products meet the definition of a derivative  under FAS 133. Net
derivative expense from these transactions in 2001 was $12.2 million.

INCOME TAXES. The Company  generated income tax benefits of $8.7 million in 2001
compared  to income tax  expense  of $45.4  million  in 2000.  This tax  benefit
primarily  resulted  from the  impact of losses  relating  to the  September  11
attacks,  the Enron bankruptcy and realized  capital losses  recognized in 2001,
which reduced taxable income, partially offset by taxable income relating to the
non-recurring   receipt  of  shares  in  connection   with  a  former   client's
demutualization.

NET INCOME.  Net income was $99.0 million in 2001 compared to $186.4  million in
2000. This decrease generally reflects the losses  attributable to the September
11 attacks and the Enron  bankruptcy,  partially  offset by improved  investment
results  and the  non-recurring  receipt of shares in  connection  with a former
client's demutualization.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
LOSS AND LAE RESERVES.  The Company's  most  critical  accounting  policy is the
determination of its loss and LAE reserves.  The Company  maintains  reserves to
cover its  estimated  ultimate  liability  for  losses  and LAE with  respect to
reported and  unreported  claims.  Because  reserves  are  estimates of ultimate
losses and LAE, management  monitors reserve adequacy over time,  evaluating new
information as it becomes known and adjusting reserves as necessary.  Management
considers many factors when setting reserves,  including: (1) its exposure base,
generally  its earned  premiums;  (2) its  expected  loss ratios on current year
writings as determined  through extensive  interaction  between its underwriters
and  actuaries  by  product  and  class   categories   (3)  internal   actuarial
methodologies  which  analyze  the  Company's  experience  with  similar  cases,
information  from ceding  companies  and  historical  trends,  such as reserving
patterns,  loss  payments,  pending levels of unpaid claims and product mix; (4)
current  legal   interpretations   of  coverage  and  liability;   (5)  economic
conditions;   and  (6)  the  uncertainties  discussed  below  regarding  reserve
requirements   for   asbestos   and   environmental   claims.   Based  on  these
considerations,  management  believes that adequate  provision has been made for
the Company's loss and LAE reserves.  Actual losses and LAE ultimately  paid may
deviate,  perhaps  substantially,  from such reserves,  impacting  income in the
period  in which  the  change  is  made.  See  also  Footnote  1 to Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASBESTOS AND  ENVIRONMENTAL  EXPOSURES.  The Company continues to receive claims
under expired contracts which assert alleged injuries and/or damages relating to
or resulting from environmental  pollution and hazardous  substances,  including
asbestos.  The Company's  asbestos claims typically involve potential  liability
for bodily  injury from  exposure to asbestos or for property  damage  resulting
from  asbestos or products  containing  asbestos.  The  Company's  environmental
claims  typically  involve  potential   liability  for  (a)  the  mitigation  or
remediation  of  environmental  contamination  or (b) bodily  injury or property
damage  caused by the  release of  hazardous  substances  into the land,  air or
water.

The Company's  reserves include an estimate of the Company's  ultimate liability
for asbestos and environmental ("A&E") claims for which ultimate value cannot be
estimated  using  traditional  reserving   techniques.   There  are  significant


uncertainties  in estimating the amount of the Company's  potential  losses from
A&E claims.  Among the  complications  are: (a) potentially long waiting periods
between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage;  (b)
difficulty  in  identifying  sources of A&E  contamination;  (c)  difficulty  in
properly allocating  responsibility and/or liability for A&E damage; (d) changes
in underlying laws and judicial  interpretation of those laws; (e) potential for
an A&E claim to involve many insurance  providers over many policy periods;  (f)
long  reporting  delays,  both from  insureds to insurance  companies and ceding
companies  to  reinsurers;  (g)  historical  data on A&E  losses,  which is more
limited and  variable  than  historical  information  on other types of casualty
claims; (h) questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and
reinsurance  coverage;  and (i) uncertainty regarding the number and identity of
insureds with potential A&E exposure.

With respect to asbestos claims in particular,  several  additional factors have
emerged  recently  that  further  compound  the  difficulty  in  estimating  the
Company's  liability.  These developments  include:  (a) continued growth in the
number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar;
(b) a  disproportionate  percentage  of  claims  filed  by  individuals  with no
functional  injury from asbestos,  claims with little to no financial  value but
that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the
growth in the number and  significance  of bankruptcy  filings by companies as a
result of asbestos  claims;  (d) the growth in claim filings against  defendants
formerly  regarded as "peripheral";  (e) the  concentration of claims in a small
number of states that favor  plaintiffs;  (f) the growth in the number of claims
that might impact the general  liability  portion of insurance  policies  rather
than the product liability portion;  (g) responses in which specific courts have
adopted  measures  to  ameliorate  the  worst  procedural  abuses;  and  (h) the
potential that the U. S. Congress or state legislatures may consider legislation
to address the asbestos litigation issue.

These  uncertainties  and  factors  continue to render  reserves  for A&E losses
significantly  less subject to traditional  actuarial analysis than are reserves
for other types of losses. As a result,  management  believes that no meaningful
range for such  ultimate  losses can be  established.  The  Company  establishes
reserves  to the extent  that,  in the  judgment  of  management,  the facts and
prevailing law reflect an exposure for the Company or its ceding  companies.  In
connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley,  which has significant exposure
to A&E claims,  Prupac, a subsidiary of The Prudential,  provided reinsurance to
Mt.  McKinley  covering 80% ($160.0  million) of the first $200.0 million of any
adverse  development  of Mt.  McKinley's  reserves as of September  19, 2000. In
addition,  The  Prudential  guaranteed  Prupac's  obligations  to Mt.  McKinley.
Through  December 31,  2002,  cessions  under this  reinsurance  agreement  have
reduced the available remaining limits to $81.1 million net of coinsurance.  Due
to the  uncertainties  discussed  above, the ultimate losses may vary materially
from current  loss  reserves  and,  depending  on coverage  under the  Company's
various  reinsurance  arrangements,  could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's future financial condition,  results of operations and cash flows. See
also Footnote 1 and 3 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

REINSURANCE  RECEIVABLE.  The Company utilizes reinsurance  agreements to reduce
its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. These agreements
provide for recovery  from  reinsurers  of a portion of losses and loss expenses
under certain  circumstances  without relieving the insurer of its obligation to
the policyholder.  In the event reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations
under these reinsurance agreements, the Company would not be able to realize the
full value of the reinsurance  recoverable  balance.  In some cases, the Company
may hold  partial  collateral,  including  letters  of  credit  and  funds  held
arrangements,  for  these  agreements.  The  Company  establishes  reserves  for
uncollectible balances based on management's assessment of the collectibility of
the outstanding  balances.  To minimize exposure from uncollectible  reinsurance


receivables,  the Company  has a  reinsurance  credit  security  committee  that
generally evaluates the financial strength of a reinsurer prior to entering into
a reinsurance  arrangement.  Additionally,  creditworthy  foreign  reinsurers of
business  written in the United  States are  generally  required to secure their
obligations.  Management  believes that adequate provision has been made for the
Company's uncollectible balances. Actual uncollectible amounts may vary, perhaps
substantially,  from such reserves,  impacting income in the period in which the
change  is made.  See also  Footnote  1 to Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.

PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED.  Premiums written by the Company are earned ratably
over the periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies.
Unearned  premium  reserves  are  established  to  cover  the  remainder  of the
unexpired  contract  period.  Such reserves are  established  based upon reports
received  from ceding  companies  or computed  using pro rata  methods  based on
statistical data. Written and earned premiums, and the related costs, which have
not yet been  reported to the  Company  are  estimated  and  accrued.  As earned
premium generally  correlates with the Company's  estimate of its exposure base,
variations  in  premium  earnings  are  to a  large  degree  offset  by  related
variability in incurred  losses and commission  expense.  See also Footnote 1 to
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

INVESTMENT VALUATION. The Company's investment portfolio consists of investments
available for sale and  accordingly  these  securities are marked to market on a
quarterly basis.  Most securities are traded on national  exchanges where market
values are readily available. The Company holds some privately placed securities
that are either  valued by an  investment  advisor or by the Company  using cash
flow  projections.  Unrealized  gains and losses  from market  fluctuations  are
reflected  as  comprehensive  income,  while  market  value  declines  that  are
considered  other  than  temporary  are  reflected  in the income  statement  as
realized capital losses.  The Company  considerers many factors when determining
whether a market  value  decline is other  than  temporary,  including:  (1) the
length of time the  market  value has been  below  book  value,  (2) the  credit
strength of the issuer,  (3) the  issuer's  market  sector and (4) the length of
time to maturity. Due to the uncertainty of these factors, investment losses may
arise and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also Footnote 1 to Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL  CONDITION
CASH  AND  INVESTED  ASSETS.  Aggregate  invested  assets,  including  cash  and
short-term  investments,  were $7,259.1  million at December 31, 2002,  $5,783.5
million at December  31, 2001 and $5,493.0  million at December  31,  2000.  The
increase in cash and invested  assets from 2001 to 2002 resulted  primarily from
$736.1 million in cash flows from operations  generated in 2002,  $346.3 million
of net proceeds  from the  offering of common  shares in February  2002,  $203.4
million  of net  proceeds  from  Capital  Trust's  issuance  of trust  preferred
securities in November 2002 and $135.9 million in net unrealized appreciation of
the  Company's  investments.  These  increases  were  partially  offset by $35.0
million in net payments on Holdings'  credit facility and $22.9 million in share
repurchases. The increase in cash and invested assets from 2000 to 2001 resulted
primarily  from $406.0 million in cash flows from  operations  generated in 2001
and $57.3 million in net unrealized  appreciation of the Company's  investments.
These  increases  were  partially  offset by $130.0  million in net  payments on
Holdings' credit facility.

LOSS AND LAE RESERVES.  Gross loss and LAE reserves  totaled $4,905.6 million at
December 31, 2002, $4,278.3 million at December 31, 2001 and $3,786.2 million at
December 31, 2000. The increase in 2002 was primarily  attributable to increased
premiums  earned,  modest  reserve  strengthening  in select  areas  and  normal


variability   in  claim   settlements.   The  increase  in  2001  was  primarily
attributable  to increased  catastrophe  losses  resulting from the September 11
attacks, together with increased earned premiums and normal variability in claim
settlements.  Reinsurance  receivables  totaled $1,116.4 million at December 31,
2002,  $895.1  million at December  31, 2001 and $509.0  million at December 31,
2000,  with the changes in 2002  principally  reflecting  losses ceded under the
accident  year  aggregate  excess of loss  element  of the  Company's  corporate
retrocessional  program  and  losses  ceded as part of a  reinsurance  agreement
between Mt. McKinley and Prupac. At December 31, 2002, $440.0 million, or 39.4%,
was receivable from  subsidiaries of London  Reinsurance  Group ("London Life").
These receivables are effectively  secured by a combination of letters of credit
and funds held  arrangements  under which the Company has  retained  the premium
payments due the retrocessionaires,  recognized liabilities for such amounts and
reduced  such  liabilities  as payments  are due from the  retrocessionaire.  In
addition,  $145.0 million,  or 13.0%, was receivable from Continental  Insurance
Company  ("Continental),  which is partially secured by funds held arrangements,
and $78.9 million or 7.1%, was receivable  from Prupac,  whose  obligations  are
guaranteed by The Prudential. No other retrocessionaire  accounted for more than
5% of the Company's receivables.

The  Company  generally  has  exposure to A&E losses  through  its Mt.  McKinley
operation with respect to insurance policies and through Everest Re with respect
to reinsurance contracts. In each case, the Company's management and analysis of
its  exposures  takes into  account a number of  features of its  business  that
differentiate  the Company's  exposures  from many other insurers and reinsurers
that have significant A&E exposures.

Mt.  McKinley  began writing small amounts of A&E exposed  insurance in 1975 and
increased  the volume of its writings in 1977.  These  writings  ceased in 1984,
giving Mt.  McKinley an  approximate  10-year  window of potential A&E exposure,
which  is  appreciably  shorter  than  is  the  case  for  many  companies  with
significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and standardization of
policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s to have been issued
without  aggregate limits on at least the product  liability  coverage  offered;
policies  issued in earlier  decades  are  generally  more at risk of not having
aggregate limits.

The vast majority of Mt.  McKinley's A&E exposed  insurance  policies are excess
casualty policies, with aggregate coverage limits, which by definition also have
protection  afforded by underlying  coverage.  Mt. McKinley's  attachment points
vary but usually are protected by millions,  often tens of millions,  of dollars
of underlying  coverage.  The excess nature of most of Mt.  McKinley's  policies
also offers protection against  non-product claims (for example,  claims arising
under general liability  coverage).  Although under some circumstances an excess
policy could be exposed to non-product  claims,  such claims generally pose more
of a risk to primary  policies  because  non-product  claims are generally  less
likely to  aggregate.  In addition,  environmental  claims  arise under  general
liability coverage,  and generally do not aggregate.  Thus, these claims tend to
create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies.

Virtually all of the Mt. McKinley policies that are still potentially exposed to
claims have policy  language  providing  that  expenses  were paid within limits
rather than in addition to limits. This is a substantial difference from primary
coverage, which would most often cover expenses in addition to limits.

Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty
business  under  which  A&E  exposures   generally  arise  until  1974,  and  it
effectively  eliminated A&E exposures  through contract  exclusions  effected in
1984.  Therefore,  Everest Re has an approximate 11-year window of A&E exposure,


much shorter than that of many  reinsurance  companies that have significant A&E
exposures. In the earlier years of its existence,  Everest Re was not as heavily
involved in casualty  business as in property  business,  which generally is not
exposed to asbestos claims.  Everest Re generally took smaller lines of exposure
per contract than many other  reinsurers  operating in the casualty  reinsurance
market and those  lines  were  generally  also  smaller  than the excess  limits
provided  by Mt.  McKinley  policies.  This  means  that the  potential  adverse
development  on Everest Re's  reinsurance  business  would not be subject to the
same  level of  volatility  as would be the case for  companies  having  greater
exposures  per risk.  Everest Re  reinsured  both  primary and excess  policies.
However,  its  claim  experience  to date  indicates  that the  majority  of its
reinsurance  supported  excess  policies.  As a  result,  most of  Everest  Re's
exposure derives from excess policies similar to those written by Mt. McKinley.

With respect to both the Mt. McKinley and Everest Re operations, the Company was
not a member of the Asbestos  Claims Facility  ("Wellington")  or the Center for
Claims Resolution ("CCR") claim settlement facilities. Insurers supporting those
facilities  made broad  commitments  concerning  the  application  of  insurance
coverage to asbestos claims. With respect to its direct insurance exposures, the
fact that the  Company  has not made those  commitments  may allow it to resolve
insurance  exposure to Wellington/CCR  insureds more economically than if it had
joined these facilities. With respect to its reinsurance exposures, although the
Company was not a signatory to the Wellington or CCR facilities,  it has, within
the bounds of its reinsurance  contracts,  generally  supported ceding companies
that were  signatories.  Because the insurers  supporting  these facilities have
generally paid their  exposures more quickly than  non-signatory  insurers,  the
Company  believes that this has generally meant that it has paid its reinsurance
exposure  more  quickly  than it likely would have if it had not been subject to
Wellington/CCR payments.

The Company believes that its A&E exposures are unique and  differentiated  from
those insurers and reinsurers with  appreciable A&E exposure by the points noted
above,  but there can be no assurance that such factors will protect the Company
from adverse development,  perhaps material, or allow it to secure advantages in
the settlement of its claims obligations.

Additional  losses,  including those relating to currently  unrecognized  latent
injuries,  the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the Company,  or
the reinsurance and insurance industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such
future  emergence,   to  the  extent  not  covered  by  existing  retrocessional
contracts, could have material adverse effects on the Company's future financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.


The table below summarizes the Company's overall reserves and claim activity for
asbestos and environmental claims, on both a gross and net of ceded reinsurance
basis, for the periods indicated:


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)   Reported  losses and paid losses for 2000 are net of  ($311.3)  million and
     $311.3  million,   respectively,   reflecting  the   establishment  of  Mt.
     McKinley's reserves at the acquisition date. Net paid losses, excluding the
     impact of the Mt. McKinley acquisition transaction, were ($42.3) million.

The gross reserves for asbestos and environmental  exposures  increased in 2002,
principally due to an increase in management's estimate of the ultimate asbestos
and  environmental  exposures,  the effect of which was partially offset by paid
losses. The net reserves for asbestos and environmental  exposures  decreased in
2002,  principally  due to an increase in losses ceded as part of a  reinsurance
agreement  between Mt.  McKinley and Prupac,  the effect of which was  partially
offset by paid losses. The gross and net reserves for asbestos and environmental
exposures in 2000 include Holdings' acquisition of Mt. McKinley.

Industry analysts have developed a measurement,  known as the survival ratio, to
compare the  asbestos  and  environmental  reserves  among  companies  with such
liabilities.  The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company's
current  reserves  by the  three-year  average  of paid  losses,  and  therefore
measures the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current  reserves
based on historical payment patterns. Using this measurement,  the Company's net
three-year  asbestos and environmental  survival ratio was 9.2 years at December
31, 2002.  Adjusting these ratios to include the effect of the remaining  limits
of  reinsurance  available  under the  reinsurance  agreement  with Prupac,  the
measures rise to the equivalent of 10.6 years at December 31, 2002.  Because the
survival  ratio was developed as a comparative  measure of reserve  strength and


not of absolute reserve adequacy,  the Company considers,  but does not rely on,
the survival ratio when evaluating its reserves.

As noted earlier,  there were developments in 2002 affecting  asbestos exposures
in  general  and  the  Company's   asbestos   exposures  in  particular.   These
developments  together with  enhancements in the Company's claim  management and
analytical processes resulted in the reserve strengthening noted earlier.  These
developments and actions have increased the emphasis on asbestos  exposures as a
separate  component  of the  Company's  A&E  exposures.  Despite  the  Company's
approach of handling A&E  exposures  on a combined  basis,  management  believes
additional   disclosure  of  the  asbestos  element  of  its  A&E  exposures  is
appropriate.

The following tables summarize  reserves and claim activity for asbestos claims,
on both a gross and net of ceded  reinsurance  basis, for the periods  indicated
with particular emphasis on the differentiation of insured categories within the
Mt. McKinley  operation,  which the Company believes  reflects the most volatile
element of its asbestos exposures.




(1)  Some totals may not reconcile due to rounding.
(2)  Under CIP  agreements,  payments  depend upon the  insured's  actual claims
     experience  and may be subject to annual caps or other controls on the rate
     of payment.
(3)  Actively  Managed means that Mt. McKinley is managing the defense of claims
     against the insured.
(4)  Includes ($114.8) million of paid loss impact arising from the Mt. McKinley
     acquisition in 2000.

(6)  Includes  $203.8 million ceded to and collected from The Prudential as part
     of the Company's  Stop Loss  protection  resulting  from the initial public
     offering in 1995.


The Company's net three year  survival  ratio on its asbestos  exposures was 9.7
years for the period ended  December 31, 2002.  This three year  survival  ratio
when adjusted to exclude the CIP and actively  managed  reserves was 11.9 years,
and when  adjusted  to exclude  the CIP and  actively  managed  reserves  and to
include stop loss protection from The Prudential was 14.8 years.

SHAREHOLDERS'  EQUITY. The Company's  shareholders' equity increased to $2,368.6
million as of December 31, 2002 from  $1,720.5  million as of December 31, 2001,
principally  reflecting  $346.3  million  in net  proceeds  from  the  Company's
offering of 5.0 million  common shares in February  2002,  $231.3 million of net
income in 2002 and an increase of $104.2 million in net unrealized  appreciation
of investments, partially offset by $22.9 million in share repurchases and $16.3
million in shareholder  dividends.  Shareholders'  equity  increased to $1,720.5
million as of December 31, 2001 from  $1,583.4  million as of December 31, 2000,
principally  reflecting  an increase of $86.1 million in retained  earnings,  an
increase of $44.8 million in net  unrealized  appreciation  of  investments  and
$10.0 million in common  shares  issued  during the year in connection  with the
exercise of stock options.  Dividends of $16.3 million,  $12.9 million and $11.0
million  were  declared  and  paid  by the  Company  in  2002,  2001  and  2000,
respectively.  During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company  repurchased
0.450  million of its common shares at an average price of $50.86 per share with
all such repurchases  occurring in the three months ended September 30, 2002. At
December 31, 2002,  1.730 million shares remained under the existing  repurchase
authorization. As part of the Company's restructuring,  the treasury shares held
by the Company prior to February 24, 2000 were retired, resulting in a reduction
to treasury shares with a corresponding  reduction of paid-in capital and common
shares.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
CAPITAL.  The  Company's  business  operations  are  in  part  dependent  on the
Company's financial  strength,  and the market's perception thereof, as measured
by  shareholders'  equity,  which was $2,368.6  million and $1,720.5  million at
December  31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  The Company  has  flexibility  with


respect to  capitalization  as the result of its perceived  financial  strength,
including  its  financial  strength  ratings as assigned by  independent  rating
agencies,   and  its  access  to  the  debt  and  equity  markets.  The  Company
continuously  monitors its capital and financial position, as well as investment
and  security  market  conditions,  both in  general  and  with  respect  to the
Company's securities, and responds accordingly.

On July 30, 2002, the Company filed a shelf  registration  statement on Form S-3
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing for the issuance of up to
$475.0  million  of  securities.   Generally,   under  this  shelf  registration
statement,  Group may issue common shares,  preferred shares, debt, warrants and
hybrid  securities,  Holdings may issue debt securities and warrants and Capital
Trust may issue trust preferred securities.

In November 2002,  pursuant to a trust agreement  between  Holdings and JPMorgan
Chase Bank,  the property  trustee,  and Chase  Manhattan Bank USA, the Delaware
trustee,  Capital Trust  completed a public  offering of $210.0 million of 7.85%
trust preferred  securities,  resulting in net proceeds of $203.4  million.  The
proceeds of the  issuance  were used to purchase  $210  million of 7.85%  junior
subordinated  debt  securities  of  Holdings  that  will be held in trust by the
property  trustee for the benefit of the  holders of the  preferred  securities.
Holdings  used the proceeds  from the sale of the junior  subordinated  debt for
general  corporate  purposes and made  capital  contributions  to its  operating
subsidiaries.

Capital Trust will redeem all of the outstanding trust preferred securities when
the junior  subordinated  debt  securities  are paid at maturity on November 15,
2032. Holdings may elect to redeem the junior  subordinated debt securities,  in
whole  or in  part,  at any  time  after  November  14,  2007.  If such an early
redemption  occurs,  the  outstanding  trust  preferred  securities will also be
proportionately redeemed.

Distributions  on the trust  preferred  securities  are  cumulative and are paid
quarterly in arrears.  Disbributions  relating to the trust preferred securities
for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $2.1 million.

On November 7, 2001,  the Company filed a shelf  registration  statement on Form
S-3 with the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  providing for the issuance of
up to $575.0  million of common  equity.  On  February  27,  2002,  the  Company
completed an offering of 5,000,000 of its common shares at a price of $69.25 per
share,  which  resulted  in  $346.3  million  of  proceeds  before  expenses  of
approximately $0.5 million related to the offering. The Company has used the net
proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. On October 2, 2002,
the Company filed a Post-  Effective  Amendment to this  registration  statement
that removed the remaining securities from registration.

On March 14,  2000,  Holdings  completed  public  offerings  of  $200.0  million
principal  amount of 8.75%  senior  notes due March 15, 2010 and $250.0  million
principal  amount of 8.5% senior notes due March 15, 2005.  During 2000, the net
proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were distributed by Holdings to
Group. Interest expense incurred in connection with these senior notes was $38.9
million,  $38.9 million and $30.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

LIQUIDITY.  The Company's  liquidity  requirements  are met on a short-term  and
long-term basis by funds provided by premiums  collected,  investment income and
collected  reinsurance  receivables  balances,  and by the sale and  maturity of
investments,  together  with the  availability  of  funds  under  the  Company's
revolving  credit  facility.   The  Company's  net  cash  flows  from  operating


activities were $736.1  million,  $406.0 million and $90.0 million for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The following table shows
cash  flows  from  operating  activities,  as  well  as  the  impact  of  select
transactions  on those cash flows,  for the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001
and 2000.


(1)  Recoveries  under the Stop Loss  Agreement  with Mt.  McKinley prior to the
     acquisition of Mt. McKinley.
(2)  Net tax payments for 2001 include a $35.0  million  payment to the Internal
     Revenue Service in connection with the Company's 1997 tax year liabilities.
     This one-time payment effectively settled a deferred tax liability relating
     to the tax basis losses incurred in the 1997 tax year. This payment,  which
     related  to a timing  item,  had no  impact  on the  Company's  results  of
     operations for the period.
(3)  Non-recurring receipt of shares in a demutualized insurer.

The growth in net cash flows from operating activities reflects  improvements in
product pricing,  together with growth in the Company's invested asset base, and
is  generally  consistent  with  expectations,  given the  Company's  investment
strategies and mix of business and the normal variability of premium collections
and the payout of loss reserves.

The Company's  current  investment  strategy seeks to maximize  after-tax income
through a high  quality,  diversified,  taxable bond and  tax-preferenced  fixed
maturity  portfolio,  while  maintaining  an adequate  level of  liquidity.  The
Company's   mix  of  taxable  and   tax-preferenced   investments   is  adjusted
continuously,  consistent  with the Company's  current and  projected  operating
results, market conditions and the Company's tax position.  Proceeds from sales,
calls and maturities and investment asset acquisitions were $2,822.1 million and
$3,929.7  million,  respectively,  in 2002  compared  to  $1,492.2  million  and
$1,767.4  million,  respectively,  in 2001 and  $1,006.5  million  and  $2,024.6
million, respectively, in 2000.

On December 21, 1999, Holdings entered into a three-year senior revolving credit
facility  with a syndicate of lenders (the "Credit  Facility").  On November 21,
2002,  the  maturity  date of the Credit  Facility  was extended to December 19,
2003. Wachovia Bank, National  Association  (formerly First Union National Bank)
is the administrative agent for the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is used
for liquidity and general corporate  purposes.  The Credit Facility provides for
the  borrowing  of up to $150.0  million  with  interest  at a rate  selected by
Holdings equal to either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted
London  InterBank  Offered Rate  ("LIBOR")  plus a margin.  The Base Rate is the
higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as
its prime rate or the Federal  Funds rate plus 0.5% per annum.  On December  18,
2000,  the Credit  Facility was amended to extend the borrowing  limit to $235.0
million for a period of 120 days.  This 120-day  period expired during the three
months ended March 31, 2001 and the limit reverted to $150.0 million. The amount
of margin and the fees  payable for the Credit  Facility  depend upon  Holding's
senior unsecured debt rating. Group has guaranteed  Holdings'  obligations under
the Credit Facility.


The Credit Facility  requires the Company to maintain a debt to capital ratio of
not greater  than 0.35 to 1,  Holdings to maintain a minimum  interest  coverage
ratio of 2.5 to 1 and Everest Re to  maintain  its  statutory  surplus at $850.0
million  plus 25% of future  aggregate  net income  and 25% of future  aggregate
capital  contributions.  As of December 31, 2002,  the Company was in compliance
with these requirements.

During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,  Holdings made payments
on the Credit  Facility  of $80.0  million,  $152.0  million  and $0.0  million,
respectively.  During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Holdings
had new Credit  Facility  borrowings of $45.0 million,  $22.0 million and $176.0
million,   respectively.  As  of  December  31,  2002  and  2001,  Holdings  had
outstanding  Credit  Facility  borrowings of $70.0  million and $105.0  million,
respectively.  Interest expense incurred in connection with these borrowings was
$3.5  million,  $7.1 million and $8.5  million for the years ended  December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The cash flow activity in 2002  included  $346.3  million of new cash  resulting
from the offering of common  shares in February  and $210.0  million of new cash
from the  issuance of trust  preferred  securities  in  November.  The cash flow
activity  in 2000  included  $340.1  million  of new  cash  resulting  from  the
acquisitions  of Mt.  McKinley and Everest  International  and $448.5 million in
proceeds from Holdings' offering of senior notes.

The Company has arrangements available for the issue of letters of credit, which
letters are generally  collateralized  by the Company's cash or investments.  At
December  31,  2002,  $156.5  million  of  letters  of credit  were  issued  and
outstanding under these arrangements.

EXPOSURE TO  CATASTROPHES.  As with other  reinsurers,  the Company's  operating
results and  financial  condition  can be  adversely  affected  by volatile  and
unpredictable  natural  and other  disasters,  such as  hurricanes,  windstorms,
earthquakes,  floods,  fires and explosions.  Any such catastrophic  event could
generate  insured  losses in one or many of the  Company's  treaties or lines of
business,  including  property and/or casualty  exposures.  Although the Company
attempts  to limit its  exposure to  acceptable  levels,  including  through the
purchase of reinsurance  when  considered to be cost  effective,  it is possible
that an actual  catastrophic event or multiple  catastrophic events could have a
material  adverse effect on the financial  condition,  results of operations and
cash flows of the Company.

The Company employs various techniques, including licensed software modeling, to
assess its accumulated  exposure.  Such techniques are inherently more difficult
to apply to  non-property  exposures.  Accumulated  exposures  with  respect  to
catastrophe  losses are generally  summarized  in terms of the probable  maximum
loss ("PML").  The Company defines PML as its anticipated  maximum loss,  taking
into account contract limits,  caused by a single catastrophe  affecting a broad
contiguous  geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake of
such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in every 100 years.

Management believes that the Company's greatest  catastrophe  exposure worldwide
from any single event is to an earthquake affecting the west coast of the United
States  where the  Company  estimates  it has a PML  exposure  of $338  million,
including workers'  compensation  exposures.  The Company further estimates that
its PML exposure with respect to its greatest windstorm exposure,  which relates
to a hurricane  affecting the east coast of the United  States,  is $264 million
and that its single event International PML exposure is $197 million.  There can
be no  assurance  that the Company will not  experience  losses from one or more
catastrophic events that exceed,  perhaps by a substantial amount, its estimated
PML.


The  Company  employs a  retrocessional  approach  under  which the  Company may
purchase   reinsurance   to  cover   specific   business   written  or  exposure
accumulations  or as a  corporate  level  retrocessional  program  covering  the
potential  accumulation  or aggregation  of exposures  across some or all of the
Company's  operations.  All reinsurance  purchasing  decisions consider both the
potential  coverage and market  conditions  with respect to the pricing,  terms,
conditions and  availability  of such  coverage,  with the aim of securing cost-
effective  protection.  The level of  reinsurance  coverage  varies  over  time,
reflecting the  underwriter's  and/or Company's view of the changing dynamics of
both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets.

If a single catastrophe were to occur in the United States that resulted in $338
million of gross losses and allocated loss adjustment  expenses ("ALAE") in 2003
(an amount  equivalent  to the Company's PML including its property and workers'
compensation  exposures),  management estimates that the effect on the Company's
income  before and after  taxes  would be  approximately  $338  million and $264
million,  respectively.  Such  impact  represents  approximately  11.1%  of  the
Company's beginning of year capital.

For 2002 and initially in 2003, the Company has chosen not to purchase corporate
retrocessional protection and to generally de-emphasize the purchase of specific
reinsurance by its underwriters reflecting the Company's view that its exposures
in the context of its capital and financial position do not warrant  reinsurance
purchases at current price levels. For both 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased
accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage,  which provides up
to $175.0  million of recoveries if Everest Re's  consolidated  statutory  basis
accident year loss ratio exceeds a loss ratio  attachment  point provided in the
contract for the respective  accident years.  Each  arrangement  provides for an
adjustment  premium,  which reduces the net benefit by approximately 50%, in the
event that the  coverage is used.  The  remaining  limit  available  under these
coverages is $85.0  million and $0.0 million,  respectively.  See ITEM 1 - "Risk
Management and Retrocession Arrangements" for further details.

DIVIDENDS
During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company declared and paid shareholder  dividends
of $16.3 million, $12.9 million and $11.0 million, respectively. As an insurance
holding  company,  the Company is partially  dependent  on  dividends  and other
permitted   payments  from  its  subsidiaries  to  pay  cash  dividends  to  its
shareholders.  The payment of  dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by
Everest Re is subject to  Delaware  regulatory  restrictions  and the payment of
dividends  to Group by Bermuda Re is  subject  to Bermuda  insurance  regulatory
restrictions.  Management expects that, absent significant  catastrophe  losses,
such  restrictions  should not affect  Everest  Re's  ability to declare and pay
dividends  sufficient to support Holdings' general corporate needs and Holdings'
and Bermuda  Re's  ability to declare and pay  dividends  sufficient  to support
Group's general  corporate needs.  See ITEM 1, "Business - Regulatory  Matters -
Dividends" and Note 13A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Securities and Exchange Commission  Financial Reporting Release #48 requires
registrants  to  clarify  and  expand  upon  the  existing  financial  statement
disclosure   requirements  for  derivative  financial  instruments,   derivative
commodity instruments,  and other financial instruments  (collectively,  "market
sensitive  instruments").  The  Company  does not enter  into  market  sensitive
instruments for trading purposes.

The Company's  current  investment  strategy seeks to maximize  after-tax income
through a high quality, diversified,  taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity


portfolio,  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity.  The Company's mix
of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously,  consistent
with its current and projected  operating results,  market  conditions,  and the
Company's tax position.  The fixed  maturities in the  investment  portfolio are
comprised  of  non-trading  available  for sale  securities.  Additionally,  the
Company  invests  in equity  securities,  which it  believes  will  enhance  the
risk-adjusted  total return of the  investment  portfolio.  The Company has also
engaged  in a small  number  of credit  default  swaps  and  specialized  equity
options, the market sensitivity of which is believed not to be material.

The overall investment strategy considers the scope of the Company's present and
anticipated  operations.  In  particular,  estimates  of  the  financial  impact
resulting from non-investment  asset and liability  transactions,  together with
the Company's  capital  structure and other  factors,  are used to develop a net
liability analysis.  This analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for
which the  investments  of the  Company  provide  liquidity.  This  analysis  is
considered  in the  development  of  specific  investment  strategies  for asset
allocation,  duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive
risk exposure  principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the
year, with no material change in the underlying risk characteristics.

The Company's  $7.3 billion  investment  portfolio is  principally  comprised of
fixed  maturity  securities  that are subject to interest  rate risk and foreign
currency rate risk, and equity securities that are subject to equity price risk.
The impact of these risks on the investment  portfolio is generally mitigated by
changes in the value of operating  assets and liabilities  and their  associated
income statement impact.

Interest  rate  risk is the  potential  change  in value of the  fixed  maturity
portfolio,  including short-term  investments,  due to change in market interest
rates. In a declining interest rate environment,  it includes prepayment risk on
the $881.4  million of  mortgage-backed  securities  in the $6.9  billion  fixed
maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal
payments  that  shorten  the  average  life and thus the  expected  yield of the
security.

The tables below display the potential  impact of market value  fluctuations and
after-tax unrealized appreciation on the fixed maturity portfolio as of December
31, 2002 and 2001 based on parallel 200 basis point shifts in interest  rates up
and down in 100 basis point  increments.  For legal entities with a U.S.  dollar
functional currency,  this modeling was performed on each security individually.
To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed  securities,  changes
in prepayment  expectations under different interest rate environments are taken
into account. For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the
effective  duration of the involved  portfolio of securities was used as a proxy
for the market value change under the various  interest  rate change  scenarios.
All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions.





Foreign  currency  rate risk is the potential  change in value,  income and cash
flow arising from adverse changes in foreign  currency  exchange rates.  Each of
the  Company's  foreign  operations  maintains  capital in the  currency  of the
country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory  guidelines.
Generally, the Company prefers to maintain the capital of its foreign operations
in U.S.  dollar  assets,  although  this varies by  regulatory  jurisdiction  in
accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation may conduct business in its
local currency as well as the currency of other  countries in which it operates.
The primary  foreign  currency  exposures for these foreign  operations  are the
Canadian Dollar,  the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. The Company mitigates
foreign exchange  exposure by a general matching of the currency and duration of
its  assets to its  corresponding  operating  liabilities.  In  accordance  with
Financial  Accounting  Standards Board Statement No. 52, the Company  translates
the assets,  liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal
entities to the U.S. dollar.  This translation amount is reported as a component
of other comprehensive income. The primary functional foreign currency exposures
for these foreign  operations are the Canadian Dollar,  the Euro and the British
Pound Sterling.

The tables  below  display the  potential  impact of a parallel 20% increase and
decrease in foreign  exchange rates on the valuation of invested  assets subject
to foreign currency exposure in 10% increments as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.
This analysis  includes the after-tax impact of translation  from  transactional
currency to functional  currency as well as the after-tax  impact of translation
from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency.  All amounts are
in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions.





Equity  risk is the  potential  change in market  value of the common  stock and
preferred  stock  portfolios  arising from changing  equity prices.  The Company
invests in high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major
exchanges  in the United  States and funds  investing  in such  securities.  The
primary  objective in managing the $47.5 million equity  portfolio is to provide
long-term capital growth through market appreciation and income.

The tables  below  display the impact on market value and  after-tax  unrealized
appreciation  of a 20% change in equity prices up and down in 10%  increments as
of December 31, 2002 and 2001. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented
in millions.




Although  not  considered  material  in the context of the  Company's  aggregate
exposure  to  market  sensitive   instruments,   the  Company  has  issued  five
specialized  equity put options  based on the  Standard & Poor's 500 ("S&P 500")
index that are market sensitive and sufficiently unique to warrant  supplemental
disclosure.

The duration and nature of these specialized instruments are such that no active
trading market exists.  This was  recognized at the time the  transactions  were
entered  into  and was  the  principal  rationale  for  the  Company's  use of a


probability  weighted cash flow model for its analysis of the economics of these
transactions, an approach quite similar to analytical models used throughout the
Company's reinsurance business.

As these specialized  equity put options are derivatives within the framework of
FAS  No.133,  the  Company  is  required  to  report  the  fair  value  of these
instruments  in its  balance  sheet and record any  changes to fair value in its
statement  of  operations.   The  Company  has  recorded  fair  values  for  its
obligations  on these  specialized  equity put options at December  31, 2002 and
December 31, 2001 of $22.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively; however, the
Company does not believe that the ultimate  settlement of these  transactions is
likely to require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received
or any payment at all.

As there is no active market for these  instruments,  the determination of their
fair value is based on an industry  accepted option pricing model which requires
estimates and  assumptions,  including those  regarding  volatility and expected
rates of return. The table below estimates the impact of potential  movements in
interest rates and the S&P 500 index,  which are the principal factors affecting
fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair value at December
31, 2002.  These are estimates and there can be no assurances  regarding  future
market performance.

discussed  below under the caption  "Risk  Factors".  The Company  undertakes no
obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements,  whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

RISK FACTORS
The following  risk factors,  in addition to the other  information  provided in
this report,  should be considered  when  evaluating the Company.  If any of the
following risks actually occur, the Company's  business,  financial condition or
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading
price of the Company's common shares could decline significantly.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE AS A RESULT OF FACTORS  GENERALLY  AFFECTING
THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRY.

The results of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry  historically
have been subject to significant  fluctuations and  uncertainties.  Factors that


affect the  industry  in  general  could  also  cause the  Company's  results to
fluctuate. The industry's profitability can be affected significantly by:


     o    fluctuations  in  interest  rates,  inflationary  pressures  and other
          changes  in  the  investment  environment,  which  affect  returns  on
          invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of loss amounts;

     o    rising  levels of actual  costs that are not known by companies at the
          time they price their products;

     o    volatile and unpredictable developments, including weather-related and
          other natural catastrophes;

     o    events like the September 11, 2001 attacks, which affect the insurance
          and reinsurance markets generally;

     o    changes in reserves  resulting from different types of claims that may
          arise and the development of judicial  interpretations relating to the
          scope of insurers' liability; and

     o    the overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment
          in the industry.

IF THE COMPANY'S  LOSS RESERVES ARE  INADEQUATE TO MEET ITS ACTUAL  LOSSES,  THE
COMPANY'S NET INCOME WOULD BE REDUCED OR IT COULD INCUR A LOSS.

The Company is required to  maintain  reserves to cover its  estimated  ultimate
liability  of  losses  and  loss  adjustment  expenses  for  both  reported  and
unreported  claims  incurred.  These  reserves  are only  estimates  of what the
Company thinks the settlement  and  administration  of claims will cost based on
facts and circumstances known to the Company.  Because of the uncertainties that
surround  estimating  loss reserves and loss  adjustment  expenses,  the Company
cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of losses
and loss  adjustment  reserves.  If the Company's  reserves are  insufficient to
cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses,  the Company would have to
augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings.  These charges could be
material.  The  difficulty  in estimating  the  Company's  reserves is increased
because the Company's loss reserves include reserves for potential  asbestos and
environmental liabilities. Asbestos and environmental liabilities are especially
hard to estimate for many reasons,  including the long waiting  periods  between
exposure and  manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage,  difficulty
in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental  contamination,  long
reporting  delays  and  difficulty  in  properly  allocating  liability  for the
asbestos or environmental damage.

THE COMPANY'S INABILITY TO ASSESS UNDERWRITING RISK ACCURATELY COULD REDUCE  ITS
NET INCOME.

The Company's success is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks
associated  with the  businesses  on which the risk is retained.  If the Company
fails to  assess  accurately  the  risks it  retains,  the  Company  may fail to
establish appropriate premium rates and the Company's reserves may be inadequate
to cover its losses,  requiring augmentation of the Company's reserves, which in
turn, could reduce the Company's net income.


DECREASES IN RATES FOR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY  REINSURANCE  AND  INSURANCE  COULD
REDUCE THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME.

The Company  primarily  writes property and casualty  reinsurance and insurance.
The property and casualty industry historically has been highly cyclical.  Rates
for property and casualty  reinsurance and insurance are influenced primarily by
factors that are outside of the Company's control.  Any significant  decrease in
the rates for property and casualty  insurance or  reinsurance  could reduce the
Company's net income.

IF RATING AGENCIES  DOWNGRADE THEIR RATINGS OF THE COMPANY'S  INSURANCE  COMPANY
SUBSIDIARIES,  THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY COULD
BE SIGNIFICANTLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

The  Company's  insurance  company  subsidiaries,  other than Mt.  McKinley  and
Everest  International,  currently hold an A+  ("Superior")  financial  strength
rating from A.M. Best Company.  Everest Re, Bermuda Re and Everest National hold
an AA-  ("Positve")  financial  strength  rating from Standard & Poor's  Ratings
Services. Everest Re and Bermuda Re hold an Aa3 ("Excellent") financial strength
rating from Moody's Investors Service,  Inc. Financial strength ratings are used
by insurers and reinsurance and insurance  intermediaries  as an important means
of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers.  In addition, the
rating of a company  purchasing  reinsurance  may be  adversely  affected  by an
unfavorable  rating or the lack of a rating of its  reinsurer.  A  downgrade  or
withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect the Company's  ability
to market its insurance products and would have a significant and adverse effect
on its future prospects for growth and profitability.

THE COMPANY'S REINSURERS MAY NOT SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

The Company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers because the
transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve the Company of its liability to
the insured.  In addition,  reinsurers  may be unwilling to pay the Company even
though  they  are able to do so.  The  failure  of one or more of the  Company's
reinsurers  to honor their  obligations  in a timely  fashion  would  impact the
Company's  cash flow and reduce its net  income and could  cause the  Company to
incur a significant loss.

IF  THE  COMPANY  IS  UNABLE  TO  PURCHASE  REINSURANCE  AND  TRANSFER  RISK  TO
REINSURERS, ITS NET INCOME COULD BE REDUCED OR THE COMPANY COULD INCUR A LOSS.

The Company  attempts  to limit its risk of loss by  purchasing  reinsurance  to
transfer  a  portion  of the  risks it  assumes.  The  availability  and cost of
reinsurance is subject to market conditions,  which are outside of the Company's
control.  As a result,  the  Company  may not be able to  successfully  purchase
reinsurance  and  transfer  risk  through  reinsurance  arrangements.  A lack of
available  reinsurance  might  adversely  affect the  marketing of the Company's
business  and/or  force the  Company  to  retain  all or a part of the risk that
cannot be  reinsured.  If the Company  were  required to retain  these risks and
ultimately  pay claims with respect to these  risks,  the  Company's  net income
could be reduced or the Company could incur a loss.

THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE  ABLE TO
COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE FUTURE.

The Company's  industry is highly  competitive and has  experienced  significant
price  competition.  The Company  competes  in the  Bermuda,  United  States and
international markets with domestic and international insurance companies.  Some
of these  competitors have greater  financial  resources than the Company,  have
been  operating for longer than the Company and have  established  long-term and
continuing  business  relationships  throughout  the  industry,  which  can be a
significant  competitive  advantage.  In addition,  the Company  expects to face
further  competition  in the  future.  The  Company  may not be able to  compete
successfully in the future.


THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON ITS KEY PERSONNEL.

The  Company's  success  has been,  and will  continue to be,  dependent  on its
ability to retain the  services of its existing  key  executive  officers and to
attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss of the
services  of any of its key  executive  officers  or the  inability  to hire and
retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect the
Company's  ability to conduct its  business.  This  dependency  is  particularly
important  for the  Company's  Bermuda  operations  where,  under  Bermuda  law,
non-Bermudians, other than spouses of Bermudians, are not permitted to engage in
any gainful  occupation  in Bermuda  without a work permit issued by the Bermuda
government.  A work permit is only  granted or extended if the employer can show
that, after proper public advertisement,  no Bermudian or spouse of a Bermudian,
is  available  who meets the minimum  standards  for the  position.  The Bermuda
government  has  announced  a  policy  that  places  a  six-year  term  limit on
individuals  with work  permits,  subject to  specified  exemptions  for persons
deemed to be key  employees.  These  restrictions  make it difficult to hire and
retain highly qualified  personnel in Bermuda.  If work permits are not obtained
or renewed for the Company's  key  employees in Bermuda,  the Company could lose
their services,  which could adversely  affect the Company's  ability to conduct
its business.

THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S  INVESTMENT  PORTFOLIO AND THE  INVESTMENT  INCOME IT
RECEIVES FROM THAT  PORTFOLIO  COULD DECLINE AS A RESULT OF MARKET  FLUCTUATIONS
AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

A significant  portion of the Company's  investment  portfolio consists of fixed
income securities and a smaller portion consists of equity securities.  Both the
fair market  value of these assets and the  investment  income from these assets
fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions.  For example, the
fair market value of the Company's fixed income securities  generally  increases
or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates. The
fair market value of the Company's fixed income  securities can also decrease as
a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of
those  securities to  deteriorate.  The net  investment  income that the Company
realizes  from future  investments  in fixed income  securities  will  generally
increase or decrease with interest rates.  Interest rate  fluctuations  can also
cause net investment income from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as
mortgage-backed  and other  asset-backed  securities,  to differ from the income
anticipated  from those  securities  at the time the  Company  bought  them.  In
addition,  if  issuers  of  individual  investments  are  unable  to meet  their
obligations,  investment  income will be reduced and realized capital losses may
arise.  Because all of the Company's  securities are classified as available for
sale,  changes in the market value of the Company's  securities are reflected in
its financial statements. Similar treatment is not available for liabilities. As
a result,  a decline in the value of the  securities in the Company's  portfolio
could reduce its net income or cause the Company to incur a loss.

INSURANCE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RESTRICT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO OPERATE.

The Company is subject to  extensive  regulation  under U.S.,  state and foreign
insurance laws. These laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the
Company by its operating  subsidiaries,  impose  restrictions  on the amount and
type of investments that they can hold,  prescribe  solvency standards that must
be met and maintained by them and require them to maintain reserves.  These laws
also require disclosure of material intercompany  transactions and require prior
approval  of  certain   "extraordinary"   transactions.   These  "extraordinary"
transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed
statutory  thresholds.  These laws also generally require approval of changes of
control.  The  Company's  failure to comply with these laws could  subject it to


fines and penalties and restrict it from conducting business. The application of
these laws could affect the Company's  liquidity and ability to pay dividends on
its  common  shares  and could  restrict  the  Company's  ability  to expand its
business  operations  through  acquisitions  involving the  Company's  insurance
subsidiaries.

FAILURE TO COMPLY  WITH  INSURANCE  LAWS AND  REGULATIONS  COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

The Company may not have all required  licenses and  approvals or may not comply
with  the wide  variety  of  applicable  laws and  regulations  or the  relevant
authorities' interpretation of the laws and regulations. If the Company does not
have the  requisite  licenses and  approvals or does not comply with  applicable
regulatory requirements,  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or
temporarily  suspend the Company from carrying on some or all of its  activities
or monetarily penalize the Company. These types of actions could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's business.

THE  COMPANY'S  HOLDING COMPANY STRUCTURE COULD PREVENT IT FROM PAYING DIVIDENDS
ON ITS COMMON SHARES.

Group is a holding company whose most significant assets consist of the stock of
its operating subsidiaries. Thus, Group's ability to pay dividends on its common
shares in the  future may be  dependent  on the  earnings  and cash flows of its
subsidiaries  and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance
or repay funds to Group. This ability is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive,  regulatory and other factors beyond the Company's control. Payment
of  dividends  and  advances  and  repayments  from  some of  Group's  operating
subsidiaries  are  regulated  by U.S.,  state  and  foreign  insurance  laws and
regulatory  restrictions,  including minimum solvency and liquidity  thresholds.
Accordingly,  Group's operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or
advance or repay funds to Group in the future,  which could  prevent the Company
from  paying  dividends  or  making  other  payments  or  distributions  on  its
securities.

THE COMPANY  MAY  EXPERIENCE  EXCHANGE  LOSSES IF IT DOES NOT MANAGE ITS FOREIGN
CURRENCY EXPOSURE PROPERLY.

The Company's  functional  currency is the United States  dollar.  However,  the
Company  writes a portion of its business and receives a portion of its premiums
in currencies  other than United States  dollars.  The Company also  maintains a
portion of its  investment  portfolio in  investments  denominated in currencies
other than United  States  dollars.  Consequently,  the  Company may  experience
exchange  losses if its foreign  currency  exposure is not  properly  managed or
otherwise hedged. If the Company seeks to hedge its foreign currency exposure by
using forward foreign currency exchange contracts or currency swaps, the Company
will be subject to the risk that the counter parties to those  arrangements will
fail to  perform,  or that  those  arrangements  will not  precisely  offset the
Company's exposure.

IF U.S. TAX LAW CHANGES, THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME MAY BE REDUCED.

In the last few years,  some members of Congress  have  expressed  concern about
U.S.   corporations   that  move  their  place  of   incorporation   to  low-tax
jurisdictions.  Also,  some members of Congress  have  expressed  concern over a
competitive advantage that  foreign-controlled  insurers and reinsurers may have
over U.S.  controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance
by U.S.  insurers  from  affiliates  operating  in some  foreign  jurisdictions,
including Bermuda. Legislation has recently been proposed in Congress that would
increase the U.S. tax burden on so-called "inverting" companies and increase the


U.S. tax burden on related-party reinsurance transactions.  The Company does not
know whether this  legislation or any similar  legislation  will ever be enacted
into law.  If it were  enacted,  the U.S.  tax burden on the  Company's  Bermuda
operations,  or on some business  ceded from its licensed U.S.  subsidiaries  to
some offshore  reinsurers,  could be increased.  This could reduce the Company's
net income.

GROUP AND/OR BERMUDA RE MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX, WHICH WOULD
REDUCE THE  COMPANY'S  NET  INCOME.

The income of Bermuda Re is a  significant  portion of the  Company's  worldwide
income from operations.  The Company has established  guidelines for the conduct
of its Bermuda  operations  that are  designed to ensure that  Bermuda Re is not
engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Based on its
compliance with those  guidelines,  the Company  believes that Bermuda Re should
not be required to pay U.S.  corporate income tax, other than withholding tax on
U.S. source dividend income.  However,  if the IRS  successfully  contended that
Bermuda Re was engaged in a trade or business in the United  States,  Bermuda Re
would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on any income that is subject
to the taxing  jurisdiction  of the United States,  and possibly the U.S. branch
profits tax. Even if the IRS successfully  contended that Bermuda Re was engaged
in a U.S. trade or business,  the U.S.-Bermuda tax treaty would preclude the IRS
from  taxing  Bermuda  Re's  income  except to the extent  that its income  were
attributable to a permanent  establishment  maintained by that  subsidiary.  The
Company does not believe that  Bermuda Re has a permanent  establishment  in the
United States. If the IRS successfully contended that Bermuda Re did have income
attributable  to a permanent  establishment  in the United  States,  it would be
subject to U.S. tax on that income.

The Company  believes it qualifies  for  benefits  under the  U.S.-Barbados  tax
treaty.  Based on the Company's  compliance with  guidelines  designed to ensure
that it generates only immaterial  amounts, if any, of income that is subject to
the taxing  jurisdiction  of the United  States,  the Company  believes  that it
should be required to pay only  immaterial  amounts,  if any, of U.S.  corporate
income tax, other than withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income.  However,
if the IRS  successfully  contended  that the  Company had  material  amounts of
income  that is subject to the taxing  jurisdiction  of the United  States,  the
Company would be required to pay U.S.  corporate income tax on that income,  and
possibly the U.S.  branch  profits tax. Even if the IRS  successfully  contended
that the  Company had  material  amounts of income that is subject to the taxing
jurisdiction of the United States,  the  U.S.-Barbados tax treaty would preclude
the IRS from taxing the Company's  income,  except to the extent that its income
were attributable to a permanent establishment  maintained in the United States.
The Company does not believe that it has material amounts of income attributable
to a  permanent  establishment  in the United  States.  If the IRS  successfully
contended, however, that the Company did have income attributable to a permanent
establishment in the United States,  the Company would be subject to U.S. tax on
that income. If Bermuda Re became subject to U.S. income tax on its income or if
the Company became subject to U.S. income tax on more than immaterial amounts of
income,  the Company's  income could also be subject to the U.S.  branch profits
tax.  In that  event,  Group and  Bermuda Re would be subject to  taxation  at a
higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as U.S. corporations.
The combined effect of the 35% U.S. corporate income tax rate and the 30% branch
profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 54.5%. The imposition of these taxes would
reduce the Company's net income.


HOLDERS  OF THE  COMPANY'S  COMMON  SHARES  COULD BE  SUBJECT  TO U.S.  TAXES ON
UNDISTRIBUTED INCOME OF GROUP AND/OR BERMUDA RE.

U.S.  holders of common  shares  generally  will not be subject to any U.S.  tax
until they receive a distribution  from Group or dispose of their common shares.
However, special provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which the
Company refers to in this document as the Code, may apply to U.S.  taxpayers who
directly,  indirectly or by  attribution  own 10% or more of the total  combined
voting power of all classes of share  capital of Group and/or  Bermuda Re. Under
these provisions, those taxpayers generally will be required to include in their
income their pro rata share of the income of Group and/or  Bermuda Re as earned,
even  if not  distributed.  The  Company  has  attempted  to  avoid  having  its
shareholders become subject to these provisions  by including in Group's by-laws
provisions that limit the ownership of the common shares to levels that will not
subject  U.S.  shareholders  to U.S.  tax on  undistributed  income  under these
provisions.  Based on these bye-laws, the Company believes that its shareholders
should not be subject to U.S. tax on undistributed income.

In  addition,  special  provisions  of the Code  apply to U.S.  persons  who are
shareholders of a foreign  insurance  company and have related person  insurance
income allocated to them. Related person insurance income, often called RPII, is
investment  income  and  premium  income  derived  from the  direct or  indirect
insurance or reinsurance of the risk of:

     o    any U.S. tax payer who directly or indirectly through foreign entities
          owns shares of a foreign insurance company; or

     o    any person related to a U.S. taxpayer meeting the above definition.

The RPII  provisions  of the Code could apply to U.S.  taxpayers  who  directly,
indirectly or by attribution own any shares of Bermuda Re if:

     o    25% or more of the  value or  voting  power of the  share  capital  of
          Bermuda Re is owned  directly,  indirectly or by  attribution  by U.S.
          taxpayers;

     o    20% or more of the  value or  voting  power of the  share  capital  of
          Bermuda Re is owned  directly,  indirectly or by  attribution  by U.S.
          taxpayers,  or persons related to U.S.  taxpayers,  who are insured or
          reinsured by Bermuda Re; and

     o    Bermuda Re has gross RPII equal to 20% or more of its gross  insurance
          income.

The Company  currently  believes that less than 20% of the value or voting power
of  the  share  capital  of  Bermuda  Re is  owned  directly,  indirectly  or by
attribution by U.S.  taxpayers  insured or reinsured by it or persons related to
those  taxpayers,  and/or  that less than 20% of the gross  insurance  income of
Bermuda Re for any taxable year will  constitute  RPII.  However,  if neither of
these conditions is satisfied, since the Company's U.S. shareholders are treated
by the Code as indirectly  owning shares of Bermuda Re, they will be required to
include in their  income  their pro rata  share of Bermuda  Re's RPII as earned,
even if not distributed.

GAINS  RESULTING  FROM  THE  SALE  OF  THE  COMPANY'S   COMMON  SHARES  BY  U.S.
SHAREHOLDERS COULD BE TAXED IN THE U.S. AS DIVIDENDS.

Generally,  a U.S.  shareholder will realize capital gain or loss on the sale or
exchange of the common  shares.  However,  the IRS could  contend  that  special
provisions  of the  Code  apply  and that the  amount  of any gain  equal to the


Company's  allocable untaxed earnings and profits should be taxed as a dividend.
If the IRS  successfully  contended that those  provisions apply to the Company,
shareholders  would be taxed on that amount of gain at the rates  applicable  to
ordinary  income  rather than the lower rates  applicable  to long-term  capital
gains. Assuming that none of the Company's non- U.S. subsidiaries have any RPII,
the Company  believes that these  provisions of the Code should not apply to the
disposition of any common shares by a U.S.  shareholder  who holds less than 10%
of the outstanding common shares.

THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE EUROPEAN UNION
ARE CONSIDERING  MEASURES THAT MIGHT INCREASE THE COMPANY'S TAXES AND REDUCE ITS
NET INCOME.

A number of multinational organizations, including the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development  ("OECD"),  the European Union, the Financial Action
Task Force and the Financial  Stability Forum have all recently  identified some
countries as not  participating in adequate  information  exchange,  engaging in
harmful tax practices or maintaining  adequate  controls to prevent  corruption,
such  as  money  laundering  activities.  The  OECD  has  threatened  non-member
jurisdictions  that do not  agree  to  cooperate  with the  OECD  with  punitive
sanctions by OECD member  countries,  though  specific  sanctions have yet to be
adopted  by  OECD  member  countries.  It is as yet  unclear  as to  what  these
sanctions  will be, who will adopt them and when or if they will be imposed.  On
April 18, 2002, the OECD published a list of  "uncooperative  tax havens," which
are those  jurisdictions from whom the OECD has not received  commitments to the
OECD's  principles of regulatory  and tax  transparency  and effective  exchange
information.  The  governments  of both  Bermuda  and  Barbados  have made these
commitments.  As a  result,  neither  Bermuda  nor  Barbados  was  listed  as an
uncooperative tax haven.


GROUP AND/OR  BERMUDA RE MAY BECOME  SUBJECT TO BERMUDA TAX,  WHICH WOULD REDUCE
THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME.

Group and Bermuda Re currently  are not subject to income or capital gains taxes
in Bermuda.  Both companies have received an assurance from the Bermuda Minister
of Finance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda to
the effect that if any  legislation  is enacted in Bermuda  that imposes any tax
computed  on  profits or income,  or  computed  on any  capital  asset,  gain or
appreciation,  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance  tax, then
that tax will not apply to them or to any of their  operations  or their shares,
debentures or other  obligations  until March 28, 2016.  This assurance does not
prevent the application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily  resident in
Bermuda  and does not prevent the  imposition  of any tax payable in  accordance
with the provisions of The Land Tax Act of 1967 of Bermuda or otherwise  payable
in  relation to any  property  leased to the  Company.  There are  currently  no
procedures for extending  these  assurances.  As a result,  Group and Bermuda Re
could be subject to taxes in Bermuda  after March 28,  2016,  which could reduce
the Company's net income.

GROUP MAY BECOME  SUBJECT TO BARBADOS TAX,  WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE COMPANY'S NET
INCOME.

Group has obtained an international  business company license under the Barbados
International  Business Companies Act, 1991-24.  Based on this license, Group is
entitled to special tax benefits,  including a preferred  rate of tax on profits
and gains and an exemption  from  withholding  tax in respect of any  dividends,
interest,  royalties,  fees or  management  fees  deemed  to be paid to  another
international  business  company or to a person not resident in Barbados.  Group
has also  obtained  from the  Ministry of Economic  Development  a fifteen  year


guarantee in accordance with Section 27 of the International  Business Companies
Act with respect to its continued  eligibility for this preferred  status.  This
guarantee is applicable until 2014 and is subject to negative resolution,  which
means that this  guarantee  can be revoked at any time.  In addition,  there are
currently no procedures for extending this guarantee.  As a result,  Group could
be  ineligible  for these  benefits  after that  period,  which could reduce the
Company's net income.

THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME WILL BE REDUCED IF U.S.  EXCISE AND  WITHHOLDING  TAXES
ARE INCREASED.

Bermuda Re is subject to an excise tax on reinsurance and insurance  premiums it
collects  with  respect  to risks  located in the United  States.  In  addition,
Bermuda Re may be subject to  withholding  tax on  dividend  income  from United
States  sources.  These taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in
the future on Bermuda  Re's  business,  which  could  reduce the  Company's  net
income.

REGULATORY CHALLENGES IN THE UNITED STATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF
BERMUDA RE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS.

Bermuda Re does not intend to be licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer
in any U.S.  jurisdiction.  Under current law, Bermuda Re generally is permitted
to  reinsure  U.S.  risks  from its office in Bermuda  without  obtaining  those
licenses. However, the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework has become
subject to increased  scrutiny.  In the past, there have been  congressional and
other  initiatives  in the United States  regarding  increased  supervision  and
regulation  of the  insurance  industry,  including  proposals to supervise  and
regulate  reinsurers  domiciled outside the United States. If Bermuda Re were to
become  subject to any insurance  laws of the United States or any U.S. state at
any time in the  future,  it might be  required  to post  deposits  or  maintain
minimum  surplus  levels  and  might be  prohibited  from  engaging  in lines of
business or from writing types of policies. Complying with those laws could have
a material  adverse effect on the Company's  ability to conduct  business in the
Bermuda market.

BERMUDA RE MAY NEED TO BE LICENSED OR ADMITTED IN  ADDITIONAL  JURISDICTIONS  TO
DEVELOP ITS BUSINESS.

As Bermuda Re's business  develops,  it will monitor the need to obtain licenses
in jurisdictions other than Bermuda in order to comply with applicable law or to
be able to engage  in  additional  insurance-related  activities.  In  addition,
Bermuda Re may be at a competitive disadvantage in jurisdictions where it is not
licensed or does not enjoy an exemption from  licensing  relative to competitors
that are so licensed or exempted from  licensing.  Bermuda Re may not be able to
obtain any  additional  licenses that it determines  are necessary or desirable.
Furthermore,  the process of  obtaining  those  licenses is often costly and may
take a long time.

BERMUDA  RE'S  ABILITY TO WRITE  REINSURANCE  MAY BE  SEVERELY  LIMITED IF IT IS
UNABLE TO ARRANGE FOR SECURITY TO BACK ITS REINSURANCE.

Many  jurisdictions  do not  permit  insurance  companies  to  take  credit  for
reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers on their statutory
financial  statements  without  appropriate  security.  Bermuda Re's reinsurance
clients  generally  require  it to post a letter of credit or enter  into  other
security arrangements. If Bermuda Re is unable to obtain or maintain a letter of
credit facility on commercially  acceptable terms or unable to arrange for other
types of security,  its ability to operate its business may be severely limited.
If  Bermuda  Re  defaults  on any letter of credit  that it  obtains,  it may be
required  to  prematurely  liquidate  a  substantial  portion of its  investment
portfolio and other assets pledged as collateral.


SECURITY HOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY AND SOME OF
ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EXPERTS NAMED IN THIS REPORT.

The Company is organized  under the laws of Bermuda.  Some of its  directors and
officers,  as well as some of the  experts  named  in this  report,  may  reside
outside the United  States.  A  substantial  portion of the  Company's and their
assets  are or may be  located  in  jurisdictions  outside  the  United  States.
Security  holders may not be able to effect service of process within the United
States on  directors  and  officers of the Company and those  experts who reside
outside  the United  States.  Security  holders  also may not be able to recover
against them or the Company on judgments  of U.S.  courts or to obtain  original
judgments  against them or the Company in Bermuda  courts,  including  judgments
predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.

information  required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,  processed,  summarized and reported
within the time periods  specified in Securities and Exchange  Commission  rules
and forms. Subsequent to the date of their evaluation, there were no significant
changes  in the  Company's  internal  controls  or in other  factors  that could
significantly  affect these  controls,  including  any  corrective  actions with
regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

I, Joseph V. Taranto, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Everest Re Group, Ltd;

2.   Based on my  knowledge,  this  annual  report  does not  contain any untrue
     statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact  necessary to
     make the statements  made, in light of the  circumstances  under which such
     statements  were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by
     this annual report;

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial
     information included in this annual report,  fairly present in all material
     respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this annual report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officers  and I are  responsible  for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14) for the registrant and we have;

     a.   designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to ensure  that
          material  information  relating  to  the  registrant,   including  its
          consolidated subsidiaries,  is made known to us by others within those
          entities,  particularly  during the period in which this annual report
          is being prepared;

     b.   evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls
          and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of
          this annual report (the "Evaluation Date"); and

     c.   presented   in  this   annual   report  our   conclusions   about  the
          effectiveness  of the disclosure  controls and procedures based on our
          evaluation as of the Evaluation Date;

5.   The registrant's other certifying  officers and I have disclosed,  based on
     our most recent  evaluation,  to the  registrant's  auditors  and the audit
     committee of  registrant's  board of directors (or persons  performing  the
     equivalent function):

     a.   all  significant  deficiencies  in the design or operation of internal
          controls  which could  adversely  affect the  registrant's  ability to
          record,  process,   summarize  and  report  financial  data  and  have
          identified for the  registrant's  auditors any material  weaknesses in

          internal controls; and

                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Everest Re Group, Ltd. ("Group"), a Bermuda company with its principal executive
office in Barbados,  was  established  as a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of Everest
Reinsurance  Holdings,  Inc.  ("Holdings").  On February  24,  2000, a corporate
restructuring  was completed and Group became the new parent holding  company of
Holdings.  Holders of shares of common  stock of Holdings  automatically  became
holders  of  the  same  number  of  common   shares  of  Group.   Prior  to  the
restructuring,  Group had no significant  assets or  capitalization  and had not
engaged in any business or prior  activities  other than in connection  with the
restructuring. Group, through its subsidiaries, principally provides reinsurance
and insurance in the United States,  Bermuda and international  markets. As used
in this document,  the "Company" means Group and its  subsidiaries,  except when
referring to periods prior to February 24, 2000,  when it means Holdings and its
subsidiaries.

The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America.  The statements  include the following  domestic and foreign direct and
indirect subsidiaries of Group: Holdings,  Everest Reinsurance  (Bermuda),  Ltd.
("Bermuda   Re"),   Everest  Re  Capital  Trust   ("Capital   Trust"),   Everest
International Reinsurance, Ltd. ("Everest International"), formerly AFC Re Ltd.,
Mt. McKinley  Insurance Company ("Mt.  McKinley"),  formerly  Gibraltar Casualty
Company,  Everest Global Services,  Inc. ("Global  Services"),  Everest Advisors
(Ireland)  Limited,  Everest Re  Advisors,  Ltd.,  Everest  Reinsurance  Company
("Everest Re"), Everest National Insurance Company ("Everest National"), Everest
Indemnity  Insurance Company ("Everest  Indemnity"),  Everest Re Holdings,  Ltd.
("Everest  Ltd."),  Everest Security  Insurance  Company  ("Everest  Security"),
formerly Southeastern  Security Insurance Company,  Everest Insurance Company of
Canada ("Everest Canada"), Mt. McKinley Managers, L.L.C. ("Managers"),  Workcare
Southeast,  Inc.  ("Workcare  Southeast"),  Workcare Southeast of Georgia,  Inc.
("Workcare  Georgia")  and  Workcare,  Inc.  All  amounts  are  reported in U.S.
dollars.

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting  principles  in the United States of America  requires  management to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities (and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities) at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B.  INVESTMENTS

Fixed maturity investments are all classified as available for sale.  Unrealized
appreciation and depreciation,  as a result of temporary changes in market value
during the period, are reflected in shareholders' equity, net of income taxes in
"accumulated  other  comprehensive  income".  Equity  securities  are carried at
market  value  with  unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation,  as a result of
temporary  changes  in  market  value  during  the  period,   are  reflected  in
shareholders'  equity, net of income taxes in "accumulated  other  comprehensive
income". Unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities,  which are
deemed  other than  temporary,  are  charged to net income as  realized  capital
losses.  Short-term  investments are stated at cost, which  approximates  market
value.  Realized  gains or losses on sale of  investments  are determined on the
basis of identified cost. For non-publicly traded securities,  market prices are
determined through the use of pricing models that evaluate  securities  relative
to the U.S.  Treasury  yield curve,  taking into account the issue type,  credit
quality and cash flow  characteristics  of each  security.  For publicly  traded
securities,  market  value is  based  on  quoted  market  prices.  Retrospective

                                      F-7


adjustments   are  employed  to  recalculate   the  values  of  loan-backed  and
asset-backed  securities.  Each  acquisition  lot is reviewed to recalculate the
effective yield. The recalculated effective yield is used to derive a book value
as if the  new  yield  were  applied  at the  time of  acquisition.  Outstanding
principal  factors from the time of acquisition to the adjustment  date are used
to calculate the prepayment history for all applicable  securities.  Conditional
prepayment  rates,  computed  with life to date factor  histories  and  weighted
average  maturities,  are  used to  affect  the  calculation  of  projected  and
prepayments  for pass through  security  types.  Other  invested  assets include
limited partnerships and rabbi trusts.  Limited partnerships are valued pursuant
to the equity  method of  accounting,  which  management  believes  approximates
market value. The Supplemental  Retirement Plan rabbi trust is carried at market
value, while the Deferred Compensation Plan rabbi trust and Supplemental Savings
Plan rabbi trust are carried at cost,  which  approximates  market  value.  Cash
includes cash and bank time deposits with original  maturities of ninety days or
less.

C.   UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE BALANCES

The Company provides  reserves for uncollectible  reinsurance  balances based on
management's  assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding balances. Such
reserves  were $31.6  million at December 31, 2002 and $34.4 million at December
31, 2001. See also Note 10.

D.   DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS

Acquisition costs,  consisting principally of commissions and brokerage expenses
and certain premium taxes and fees associated with the Company's reinsurance and
insurance  business  incurred  at the time a contract  or policy is issued,  are
deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned,
generally one year.  Deferred  acquisition  costs are limited to their estimated
realizable value based on the related unearned premiums,  anticipated claims and
claim expenses and anticipated  investment  income.  Deferred  acquisition costs
amortized to income were $551.8  million,  $396.8  million and $272.4 million in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The  present  value  of in  force  annuity  business  is  included  in  deferred
acquisition  costs.  This  value  is  amortized  over the  expected  life of the
business  at the time of  acquisition.  The  amortization  each  year  will be a
function of the gross  profits each year in relation to the total gross  profits
expected  over the life of the  business,  discounted  at an assumed  net credit
rate.

E.   RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

The  reserve  for  losses  and  loss  adjustment  expenses  ("LAE")  is based on
individual  case  estimates  and  reports  received  from  ceding  companies.  A
provision is included  for losses and LAE  incurred  but not  reported  ("IBNR")
based on past  experience.  A provision is also  included for certain  potential
liabilities relating to asbestos and environmental exposures,  which liabilities
cannot be estimated with traditional reserving techniques.  See also Note 3. The
reserves are reviewed  continually and any changes in estimates are reflected in
earnings in the period the adjustment is made. Management believes that adequate
provision has been made for the Company's  losses and LAE. Loss and LAE reserves
are presented  gross of reinsurance  receivables and incurred losses and LAE are
presented net of ceded reinsurance.

Accruals for contingent  commission  liabilities are established for reinsurance
contracts  that  provide  for the stated  commission  percentage  to increase or
decrease based on the loss experience of the contract.  Changes in the estimated
liability for such arrangements are recorded as contingent commissions. Accruals

                                      F-8


for contingent  commission  liabilities are determined through the review of the
contracts  that  have  these  adjustable  features  and are  estimated  based on
expected loss and loss adjustment expenses.

F.   FUTURE POLICY BENEFIT RESERVE

Liabilities for future policy benefits on annuity  policies are carried at their
accumulated  values.  Reserves for policy  benefits  include both  mortality and
morbidity claims in the process of settlement and claims that have been incurred
but not yet reported. Interest rate assumptions used to estimate liabilities for
policy  benefits  range from 4.5% to 6.4%.  Actual  experience  in a  particular
period may vary.

G.   PREMIUM REVENUES

Premiums  written are earned  ratably over the periods of the related  insurance
and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned premium reserves are established
to cover the  remainder of the  unexpired  contract  period.  Such  reserves are
established  based upon reports received from ceding companies or computed using
pro rata methods based on statistical data. Written and earned premiums, and the
related costs, which have not yet been reported to the Company are estimated and
accrued. Premiums are net of ceded reinsurance.

Annuity premiums are recognized as revenue over the premium-paying period of the
policies.

H.   INCOME TAXES

Holdings and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  file a consolidated  U.S.  federal
income tax return.  Group and its other subsidiaries,  not included in Holdings'
consolidated tax return,  file separate company U.S. federal income tax returns,
where  required.  Deferred  income taxes have been recorded to recognize the tax
effect of temporary  differences  between the financial reporting and income tax
bases of assets and liabilities.

I.   FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Assets and liabilities  relating to foreign  operations are translated into U.S.
dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date;  revenues and
expenses are translated into U.S.  dollars using average  exchange rates.  Gains
and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net
of deferred  income  taxes,  are  excluded  from net income and  accumulated  in
shareholders' equity.

J.   EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic  earnings per share are  calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects
the  potential  dilution  that could  occur if  options  granted  under  various
stock-based  compensation  plans were  exercised  resulting  in the  issuance of
common shares that then shared in the earnings of the entity. See also Note 15.

Net income per common share has been computed below, based upon weighted average
common and dilutive shares outstanding.

                                      F-9


Options to  purchase  212,000  common  shares at prices  ranging  from $63.31 to
$70.18 per share and  15,000  common  shares at prices  ranging  from  $46.09 to
$64.97 per share were outstanding at the end of 2002 and 2000, respectively, but
were not  included  in the  computation  of earnings  per diluted  share for the
respective  years  because the  options'  exercise  price was  greater  than the
average market price of the common shares at the end of such years.  All options
to purchase common shares at the end of 2001 were included in the computation of
earnings per diluted share because the average market price of the common shares
was greater than the  options'  exercise  price at the end of 2001.  The options
expire on or between October 6, 2005 and September 26, 2012.

K.   UNUSUAL LOSS EVENTS IN 2001

As a result of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and
on various  airlines on  September  11, 2001  (collectively  the  "September  11
attacks"), the Company incurred pre-tax losses, based on an estimate of ultimate
exposure  developed  through a review of its  coverages,  which  totaled  $213.2
million gross of reinsurance  and $55.0 million net of  reinsurance.  Associated
with this reinsurance were $60.0 million of pre-tax charges,  predominantly from
adjustment  premiums,  resulting in a total  pre-tax loss from the  September 11
attacks of $115.0 million.  After tax recoveries  relating  specifically to this
unusual loss event,  the net loss from the  September 11 attacks  totaled  $75.0
million.  Over 90% of the losses ceded were to treaties,  where the  reinsurers'
obligations  are  secured,   which  the  Company  believes  eliminates  material
reinsurance collection risk.

As a result  of the Enron  bankruptcy  in 2001,  the  Company  incurred  losses,
after-tax and net of reinsurance,  amounting to $25.0 million. This unusual loss
reflects all of the Company's exposures to this event,  including  underwriting,
credit and investment.

L.   ACQUISITIONS

On September 19, 2000, Holdings acquired Mt. McKinley,  f/k/a Gibraltar Casualty
Company,  for $51.8  million.  Mt.  McKinley is a run-off  property and casualty
insurer in the United States. No goodwill was generated in the transaction.  The
acquisition was recorded using the purchase  method of accounting.  Accordingly,
the December 31, 2000 consolidated  financial  statements of the Company include
the results of Mt. McKinley from September 19, 2000.

                                      F-10


In connection  with the  acquisition of Mt.  McKinley,  Prudential  Property and
Casualty Insurance Company ("Prupac"),  a subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance
Company of America ("The  Prudential"),  provided  reinsurance  to Mt.  McKinley
covering  80%  ($160.0  million)  of the first  $200.0  million  of any  adverse
development  of Mt.  McKinley's  reserves  as of  September  19,  2000  and  The
Prudential  guaranteed  Prupac's  obligation  to Mt.  McKinley.  The  stop  loss
reinsurance  protection  that was  provided  by Mt.  McKinley at the time of the
Company's  initial public offering and other  reinsurance  contracts between Mt.
McKinley and Everest Re remain in effect  following  the  acquisition.  However,
these contracts became transactions with affiliates effective on the date of the
Mt. McKinley acquisition, and their financial impact is thereafter eliminated in
consolidation. Effective September 19, 2000, Mt. McKinley and Bermuda Re entered
into a loss  portfolio  transfer  reinsurance  agreement,  whereby Mt.  McKinley
transferred, for what management believes to be arm's-length consideration,  all
of its net insurance exposures and reserves to Bermuda Re.

The following  unaudited pro forma  information  assumes the  acquisition of Mt.
McKinley  occurred at the  beginning of the year  presented.  The  unaudited pro
forma financial information is presented for informational  purposes only and is
not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had
the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of the year presented,  nor is
it necessarily indicative of future operating results.



The Company also  completed two  additional  acquisitions  during 2000,  Everest
Security, a United States property and casualty company,  whose primary business
is non-standard auto and Everest International, a Bermuda based life and annuity
company. The combined purchase price of the acquisitions was approximately $27.0
million.  Goodwill of $3.0  million and $0.0  million for Everest  Security  and
Everest  International,  respectively,  was  generated  as  a  result  of  these
acquisitions and both were recorded using the purchase method of accounting.

M.   SEGMENTATION

The  Company,  through  its  subsidiaries,   operates  in  five  segments:  U.S.
Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting,  International and Bermuda.
See also Note 17.

N.   CODIFICATION

The NAIC published a codification of statutory accounting principles,  which was
adopted by the states of domicile of the Company's U.S.  operating  subsidiaries
with an  effective  date of  January 1,  2001.  On January 1, 2001,  significant
changes to the  statutory-basis  of accounting became effective.  The cumulative
effect  of these  changes  was  recorded  as a direct  adjustment  to  statutory
surplus. See also Note 13C.

                                      F-11


O.   DERIVATIVES

The Company has in its product portfolio three credit default swaps, which it no
longer offers, and five specialized equity put options.  These products meet the
definition of a derivative under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 133").
The Company's  position in these contracts is unhedged and is accounted for as a
derivative in accordance with FAS 133. Accordingly,  these contracts are carried
at fair  value and are  recorded  in "Other  liabilities"  in the  statement  of
financial  position and changes in fair value are  recorded in the  statement of
operations.

P.   DEPOSIT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

In the normal course of its  operations,  the Company enters into contracts that
do not  meet  the risk  transfer  provisions  of FAS No.  113,  "Accounting  and
Reporting for Reinsurance of Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts".  These
contracts  are  accounted  for using the deposit  accounting  method.  For these
contracts,  the Company  originally  records  deposit  liabilities for an amount
equivalent to the assets  received.  Actuarial  studies are used to estimate the
final  liabilities  under  these  contracts  with any  change  reflected  in the
Statement of Operations.

Q.   STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

Prior to 2002, the Company accounted for its stock-based  employee  compensation
plans (See Note 15) under the  recognition  and  measurement  provisions  of APB
Opinion  No.  25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued  to  Employees",  and  related
interpretations.  Effective  January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of FAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
prospectively to all employee awards granted,  modified or settled after January
1, 2002.

Had the compensation cost for the Company's stock-based  compensation plans been
determined  based on the fair  value at the  grant  dates  for  awards  prior to
January 1, 2002 under those plans consistent with the method of FAS No. 123, the
Company's  net income and  earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts indicated below:



The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:  (i) dividend
yields ranging from 0.5% to 0.9%, (ii) expected volatility ranging from 29.3% to
45.8%,  (iii)  risk-free  interest rates ranging from a low of 3.4% to a high of
7.0% and (iv) expected life of 7.3-7.5 years.

                                      F-12


R.   POLICYHOLDER DIVIDENDS

The Company issues certain  insurance  policies with dividend payment  features.
These  policyholders share in the operating results of their respective policies
in the form of dividends declared. Dividends to policyholders are accrued during
the period in which the related  premiums are earned and are determined based on
the terms of the individual policies.

S.  APPLICATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible  Assets".  FAS 142 established new accounting and reporting
standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. It requires that an
entity determine if other intangible  assets have an indefinite useful life or a
finite useful life.  Goodwill and those intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives are not subject to  amortization  and must be tested at least annually for
impairment.  Those with finite useful lives are subject to amortization and must
be tested  annually for  impairment.  This statement is effective for all fiscal
quarters of all fiscal years  beginning  after  December  15, 2001.  The Company
adopted FAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The implementation of this statement has not
had a material impact on the financial  position,  results of operations or cash
flows of the Company.

2.   INVESTMENTS

The  amortized  cost,  market  value,  and  gross  unrealized  appreciation  and
depreciation of fixed maturity  investments and equity  securities are presented
in the tables below:



                                      F-14

The  amortized  cost  and  market  value of fixed  maturities  are  shown in the
following table by contractual  maturity.  Mortgage-backed  securities generally
are more  likely to be  prepaid  than  other  fixed  maturities.  As the  stated
maturity of such  securities  may not be  indicative of actual  maturities,  the
total for mortgage-backed securities is shown separately.


Proceeds from sales of fixed  maturity  investments  during 2002,  2001 and 2000
were $2,029.1 million,  $757.8 million and $764.4 million,  respectively.  Gross
gains of $91.9  million,  $19.3  million and $9.3  million  and gross  losses of
$106.0  million,  $46.0  million and $27.8  million were realized on those fixed
maturity sales during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Proceeds from sales of
equity security investments during 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $19.9 million, $33.3
million and $50.3  million,  respectively.  Gross gains of $0.9  million,  $13.4
million and $21.0  million and gross  losses of $0.3  million,  $0.1 million and
$1.7  million were  realized on those  equity sales during 2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.

The changes in net  unrealized  gains (losses) of investments of the Company are
derived from the following sources:


                                      F-15

The components of net investment income are presented in the table below:


The  components of realized  capital  (losses)  gains are presented in the table
below:


The net realized  capital  losses for 2002 and 2001 include  $101.3  million and
$22.6 million  respectively,  relating to write-downs in the value of securities
deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis.

Securities  with a carrying  value amount of $424.2 million at December 31, 2002
were on deposit with various  state or  governmental  insurance  departments  in
compliance with insurance laws.

During 2001,  the Company sold five European put options based on the Standard &
Poor's 500 ("S & P 500") index for total  consideration,  net of commission,  of
$16.9 million.  These contracts each have a single exercise date with maturities
ranging  from 18 to 30  years  and  strike  prices  ranging  from  $1,141.21  to
$1,540.63.  No amounts would be payable  under these  contracts if the S & P 500
index is at or above the strike  price on the exercise  dates.  If the S & P 500
index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount
due  would  vary  proportionately  with the  percentage  the index was below the
strike price. Based on historical index values and trends, the Company estimates
the  probability  for each  contract  of the S & P index  being below the strike
price on the exercise date ranges from .78% to 10.64%.  The theoretical  maximum
payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P
500 index  value were  zero.  The  present  value of these  theoretical  maximum
payouts using a 6% discount factor is $144.1 million.

Since there are no published  market values  available for these long term index
put options, a Black-Scholes model is used to estimate market value. The factors
used in determining market value are; the S & P 500 index value at the financial
statement  date,  current  interest rates matching the duration of the puts, and
estimated  volatility with current market option volatility  extrapolated to the
put  maturities  using  historical  data.  Movements  in the mark to  model  are
reflected through the income statement.

                                      F-16

During 2000,  the Company  entered into three credit swap  derivative  contracts
which provide credit default protection on a portfolio of referenced securities.
Due to changing credit market conditions and defaults,  the Company recorded net
after-tax  losses from these contracts of $3.9 million and $13.7 million in 2002
and 2001,  respectively,  to reflect  them at fair  value,  with the 2001 losses
principally  attributable to the Company's exposure to the Enron bankruptcy.  As
of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the remaining maximum after-tax net loss exposure
under these contracts is $3.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively.

The  Company's  position in these  contracts is unhedged and is accounted for as
derivatives in accordance with FAS 133. Accordingly, these contracts are carried
at  fair  value  with  changes  in  fair  value  recorded  in the  statement  of
operations.

3.   RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LAE

Activity in the reserve for losses and LAE is summarized as follows:

- -----------
(1)  Current year paid losses for 2000 are net of ($483,789)  resulting from the
     acquisition of Mt. McKinley.

Prior year incurred losses  increased by $140.1 million in 2002 and $7.8 million
in 2000. The increase in 2002 was the result of modest reserve  strengthening in
select  areas,  most  notably in  directors  and  officers,  surety and workers'
compensation lines, and with respect to asbestos  exposures,  while the increase
in 2000 was the result of normal reserve development inherent in the uncertainty
in establishing loss and LAE reserves, as well as the impact of foreign exchange
rate fluctuations on loss reserves for both periods. See also Note 1L.

                                      F-17

Activity in the reserve for future policy benefits is summarized as follows:


The Company  continues to receive  claims under expired  contracts  which assert
alleged  injuries  and/or damages  relating to or resulting  from  environmental
pollution and hazardous substances,  including asbestos.  The Company's asbestos
claims typically involve potential  liability for bodily injury from exposure to
asbestos or for property damage  resulting from asbestos or products  containing
asbestos.  The  Company's   environmental  claims  typically  involve  potential
liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of  environmental  contamination
or (b) bodily  injury or property  damages  caused by the  release of  hazardous
substances into the land, air or water.

The Company's  reserves include an estimate of the Company's  ultimate liability
for asbestos and environmental ("A&E") claims for which ultimate value cannot be
estimated  using  traditional  reserving   techniques.   There  are  significant
uncertainties  in estimating the amount of the Company's  potential  losses from
asbestos and environmental  claims. Among the complications are: (a) potentially
long waiting periods between exposure and  manifestation of any bodily injury or
property  damage;   (b)  difficulty  in  identifying   sources  of  asbestos  or
environmental    contamination;    (c)   difficulty   in   properly   allocating
responsibility  and/or  liability  for  asbestos or  environmental  damage;  (d)
changes in  underlying  laws and  judicial  interpretation  of those  laws;  (e)
potential  for an  asbestos or  environmental  claim to involve  many  insurance
providers  over  many  policy  periods;  (f) long  reporting  delays,  both from
insureds  to  insurance  companies  and  ceding  companies  to  reinsurers;  (g)
historical data on asbestos and environmental  losses, which is more limited and
variable than  historical  information  on other types of casualty  claims;  (h)
questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance
coverage; and (i) uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with
potential asbestos or environmental exposure.

With respect to asbestos claims in particular,  several  additional factors have
emerged  recently  that  further  compound  the  difficulty  in  estimating  the
Company's  liability.  These developments  include:  (a) continued growth in the
number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar;
(b) a  disproportionate  percentage  of  claims  filed  by  individuals  with no
functional  injury from asbestos,  claims with little to no financial  value but
that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the
growth in the number and  significance  of bankruptcy  filings by companies as a
result of asbestos  claims;  (d) the growth in claim filings against  defendants
formerly  regarded as "peripheral";  (e) the  concentration of claims in a small
number of states that favor  plaintiffs;  (f) the growth in the number of claims
that might impact the general  liability  portion of insurance  policies  rather
than the product liability portion;  (g) responses in which specific courts have
adopted  measures  to  ameliorate  the  worst  procedural  abuses;  and  (h) the
potential that the U. S. Congress or state legislatures may consider legislation
to address the asbestos litigation issue.

Management  believes  that these  uncertainties  and factors  continue to render
reserves  for A&E losses  significantly  less subject to  traditional  actuarial
analysis than are reserves for other types of losses. Given these uncertainties,

                                      F-18


management  believes  that no meaningful  range for such ultimate  losses can be
established.  The  Company  establishes  reserves  to the  extent  that,  in the
judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for the
Company or its ceding  companies.  In  connection  with the  acquisition  of Mt.
McKinley,  which has significant exposure to asbestos and environmental  claims,
Prupac,  a subsidiary of The  Prudential,  provided  reinsurance to Mt. McKinley
covering  80%  ($160.0  million)  of the first  $200.0  million  of any  adverse
development  of Mt.  McKinley's  reserves  as of  September  19,  2000  and  The
Prudential guaranteed Prupac's obligations to Mt. McKinley. Through December 31,
2002,  cessions  under this  reinsurance  agreement  have reduced the  available
remaining limits to $81.1 million net of coinsurance.  Due to the  uncertainties
discussed  above,  the  ultimate  losses may vary  materially  from current loss
reserves  and,  depending on coverage  under the Company's  various  reinsurance
arrangements,  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  future
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The following  table shows the  development of prior year A&E reserves on both a
gross and net of  retrocessional  basis for the years ended  December  31, 2002,
2001 and 2000:


(1)  Reported  losses and paid losses for 2000 are net of  ($311.3)  million and
     $311.3  million,   respectively,   reflecting  the   establishment  of  Mt.
     McKinley's reserves at the acquisition date. Net paid losses, excluding the
     impact of the Mt. McKinley acquisition transaction, were ($42.3) million.

At December 31, 2002, the gross reserves for asbestos and  environmental  losses
were comprised of $112.5 million  representing  case reserves reported by ceding
companies,  $55.5 million  representing  additional case reserves established by
the Company on assumed  reinsurance  claims,  $110.5 million  representing  case
reserves established by the Company on direct excess insurance claims, including
Mt.  McKinley,  $151.6  million  representing  case reserves  resulting from the
acquisition of Mt. McKinley and $237.8 million representing IBNR reserves.

4.   CREDIT LINE

On December 21, 1999, Holdings entered into a three-year senior revolving credit
facility  with a syndicate of lenders (the "Credit  Facility").  On November 21,
2002,  the  maturity  date of the Credit  Facility  was extended to December 19,
2003. Wachovia Bank, National  Association  (formerly First Union National Bank)
is the administrative agent for the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is used

                                      F-19


for liquidity and general corporate  purposes.  The Credit Facility provides for
the  borrowing  of up to $150.0  million  with  interest  at a rate  selected by
Holdings equal to either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted
London  InterBank  Offered Rate  ("LIBOR")  plus a margin.  The Base Rate is the
higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as
its prime rate or the Federal  Funds rate plus 0.5% per annum.  On December  18,
2000,  the Credit  Facility was amended to extend the borrowing  limit to $235.0
million for a period of 120 days.  This 120-day  period expired during the three
months ended March 31, 2001 and the limit reverted to $150.0 million. The amount
of margin and the fees  payable for the Credit  Facility  depend upon  Holding's
senior unsecured debt rating. Group has guaranteed  Holdings'  obligations under
the Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility agreement requires the Company to maintain a debt to capital
ratio of not greater  than 0.35 to 1,  Holdings  to maintain a minimum  interest
coverage  ratio of 2.5 to 1 and  Everest  Re to  maintain  statutory  surplus at
$850.0  million  plus 25% of  future  aggregate  net  income  and 25% of  future
aggregate  capital  contributions.  As of December 31, 2002,  the Company was in
compliance with these requirements.

During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,  Holdings made payments
on the Credit  Facility  of $80.0  million,  $152.0  million  and $0.0  million,
respectively.  During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, Holdings
had new Credit  Facility  borrowings of $45.0 million,  $22.0 million and $176.0
million,   respectively.  As  of  December  31,  2002  and  2001,  Holdings  had
outstanding  Credit  Facility  borrowings of $70.0  million and $105.0  million,
respectively.  Interest expense incurred in connection with these borrowings was
$3.5  million,  $7.1 million and $8.5  million for the years ended  December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

5.   SENIOR NOTES

On March 14,  2000,  Holdings  completed  public  offerings  of  $200.0  million
principal  amount of 8.75%  senior  notes due March 15, 2010 and $250.0  million
principal  amount of 8.5% senior notes due March 15, 2005.  During 2000, the net
proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were distributed by Holdings to
Group. Interest expense incurred in connection with these senior notes was $38.9
million, $38.9 million and $30.9 million for the years ending December 31, 2002,
2001, and 2000, respectively.

6.   TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES

In November 2002,  pursuant to a trust agreement  between  Holdings and JPMorgan
Chase Bank,  the property  trustee,  and Chase  Manhattan Bank USA, the Delaware
trustee,  Capital Trust  completed a public  offering of $210.0 million of 7.85%
trust preferred  securities,  resulting in net proceeds of $203.4  million.  The
proceeds of the  issuance  were used to purchase  $210  million of 7.85%  junior
subordinated  debt  securities  of  Holdings  that  will be held in trust by the
property  trustee  for  the  benefit  of  the  holders  of the  trust  preferred
securities.  Holdings used the proceeds from the sale of the junior subordinated
debt for  general  corporate  purposes  and made  capital  contributions  to its
operating subsidiaries.

Capital Trust will redeem all of the outstanding trust preferred securities when
the junior  subordinated  debt  securities  are paid at maturity on November 15,
2032. Holdings may elect to redeem the junior  subordinated debt securities,  in
whole  or in  part,  at any  time  after  November  14,  2007.  If such an early
redemption  occurs,  the  outstanding  trust  preferred  securities will also be
proportionately redeemed.

Distributions  on the trust  preferred  securities  will be  cumulative  and pay
quarterly in arrears.  Distributions  relating to the trust preferred securities
for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $2.1 million.

                                      F-20

7.   LETTERS OF CREDIT

The Company has arrangements available for the issue of letters of credit, which
letters are generally  collateralized by the Company's cash and investments.  At
December  31,  2002,  $156.5  million  of  letters  of credit  were  issued  and
outstanding under these arrangements,  generally supporting reinsurance provided
by the  Company's  non-U.S.  operations.  The  following  table  summarizes  the
Company's  letters of credit as of December 31, 2002.  All dollar amounts are in
the thousands.





8.   OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS

The future minimum rental commitments,  exclusive of cost escalation clauses, at
December  31, 2002 for all of the  Company's  operating  leases  with  remaining
non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows:



All of these leases,  the expiration terms of which range from 2004 to 2013, are
for the rental of office space.  Rental expense,  net of sublease rental income,
was $6.7  million,  $5.8  million  and $4.5  million  for  2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.

9.   INCOME TAXES

Under current Bermuda law, no income or capital gains taxes are imposed on Group
and its  Bermuda  subsidiaries.  The  Minister  of Finance  of Bermuda  has also
assured  Group and its  Bermuda  subsidiaries  that,  pursuant  to The  Exempted
Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966, they will be exempt until 2016 from any
such  taxes  imposed in the  future.  In  Barbados,  Group is  registered  as an
external  company  and  licensed  as an  international  business  company.  This
provides  Group  with  certain  tax  benefits,  including  a  preferred  rate of

                                      F-21


corporation tax on profits and gains in Barbados and exemption from  withholding
tax on dividend payments. No tax is imposed on capital gains.


All the income of the U.S.  subsidiaries  is subject to the applicable  federal,
foreign,  state and local taxes on corporations.  The provision for income taxes
in the consolidated  statement of income has been determined by reference to the
individual  income of each entity and the  respective  applicable  tax laws.  It
reflects the permanent differences between financial and taxable income relevant
to each entity. The significant components of the provision are as follows:



The  weighted  average  expected tax  provision  has been  calculated  using the
pre-tax  income (loss) in each  jurisdiction  multiplied by that  jurisdiction's
applicable  statutory tax rate.  Reconciliation  of the  difference  between the
provision  for income  taxes and the  expected  tax  provision  at the  weighted
average  tax rate for the years  ended  December  31,  2002 and 2001 is provided
below:



Deferred  income  taxes  reflect  the tax  effect of the  temporary  differences
between the value of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and
such values as  measured by the U.S.  tax laws and  regulations.  The  principal
items making up the net deferred income tax asset are as follows:

                                      F-22



Management  believes  that it is more  likely  than not that  the  Company  will
realize  the  benefits  of its net  deferred  tax assets  and,  accordingly,  no
valuation allowance has been recorded for the periods presented.

Tax benefits of $0.7 million and $3.4 million  related to  compensation  expense
deductions  for stock  options  exercised  in 2002 and 2001,  respectively,  are
reflected in the change in shareholders' equity in "additional paid in capital".

10.  REINSURANCE

The Company  utilizes  reinsurance  agreements  to reduce its  exposure to large
claims and catastrophic loss occurrences.  These agreements provide for recovery
from  reinsurers  of a  portion  of  losses  and  loss  expenses  under  certain
circumstances   without   relieving  the  insurer  of  its   obligation  to  the
policyholder.  Losses and LAE incurred and earned  premiums are after  deduction
for reinsurance.  In the event reinsurers were unable to meet their  obligations
under reinsurance agreements,  the Company would not be able to realize the full
value of the  reinsurance  recoverable  balances.  The Company may hold  partial
collateral,  including letters of credit and funds held, under these agreements.
See also Note 1C.

The Company considers the purchase of corporate level retrocessions covering the
potential  accumulation  of all exposures.  For 1999,  the Company  purchased an
accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession  agreement which provided up
to $175.0  million of  coverage if Everest  Re's  consolidated  statutory  basis
accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio  attachment point provided in the
contract for the 1999  accident  year.  During 2000 and 2001,  the Company ceded
$70.0  million  and  $105.0  million  of losses,  respectively,  to this  cover,
reducing the limit available  under the contract to $0.0 million.  For 2000, the
Company  purchased  an  accident  year  aggregate  excess  of loss  retrocession
agreement  which  provided  up to $175.0  million of  coverage  if Everest  Re's
consolidated  statutory  basis  accident  year loss ratio  exceeded a loss ratio
attachment  point  provided in the contract for the 2000 accident  year.  During
2002,  the Company  ceded $90.0  million of losses to this cover,  reducing  the

                                      F-23


limit  available  under the  contract to $85.0  million.  For 2001,  the Company
purchased an accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession agreement which
provided up to $175.0 million of coverage if Everest Re's consolidated statutory
basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio  attachment  point provided
in the contract for the 2001 accident  year.  During 2001 and 2002,  the Company
ceded $164.0 million and $11.0 million of losses,  respectively,  to this cover,
reducing the limit available under the contract to $0.0 million.

In  addition,  the  Company  has  coverage  under an  aggregate  excess  of loss
reinsurance  agreement  provided by Prupac,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of The
Prudential,  in connection  with the Company's  acquisition  of Mt.  McKinley in
September  2000.  This  agreement  covers 80% or $160  million of the first $200
million of any adverse loss reserve  development on the carried  reserves of Mt.
McKinley at the date of  acquisition  and  reimburses the Company as such losses
are paid by the  Company.  There  were  $78.9  million  of  cessions  under this
reinsurance  at  December  31,  2002,  reducing  the limit  available  under the
contract to $81.1 million.

In connection with the Mt. McKinley acquisition,  Prupac also provided excess of
loss  reinsurance  for 100% of the first $8.5  million  of loss with  respect to
certain  of  Mt.   McKinley's   retrocessions   and  potentially   uncollectible
reinsurance coverage. There were $0.0 million and $3.6 million of cessions under
this  reinsurance  during  the  periods  ending  December  31,  2002  and  2001,
respectively,  reducing the limit  available under the contract to $2.4 million.

Written and earned premiums are comprised of the following:



The amounts deducted from losses and LAE incurred for net reinsurance recoveries
were  $287.7  million,  $486.3  million  and $161.6  million for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

As of December 31, 2002,  the Company  carried as an asset  $1,116.4  million in
reinsurance  receivables  with respect to losses ceded.  Of this amount,  $440.0
million,  or 39.4%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Reinsurance Group
("London  Life"),  $145.0 million,  or 13.0%,  was receivable  from  Continental
Insurance  Company  ("Continental")  and $78.9 million,  or 7.1%, was receivable
from Prupac.  As of December 31,  2001,  the Company  carried as an asset $895.1
million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses ceded. Of this amount,
$339.0 million,  or 37.9%,  was receivable from  subsidiaries of London Life and
$145.0  million,   or  16.2%,   was  receivable  from   Continental.   No  other
retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company's receivables.

                                      F-24


The Company's  arrangements  with London Life and  Continental  are managed on a
funds held basis, which means that the Company has not released premium payments
to the  retrocessionaire  but rather retains such payments to secure obligations
of the  retrocessionaire,  records them as a liability,  credits interest on the
balances  and  reduces  the  liability  account as  payments  become  due. As of
December 31, 2002,  such funds had reduced the  Company's net exposure to London
Life to $190.2 million, effectively 100% of which has been secured by letters of
credit,  and its exposure to Continental  to $60.9  million.  As of December 31,
2001,  such funds  reduced the  Company's  net exposure to London Life to $158.9
million,  100% of which was  secured by letters of credit,  and its  exposure to
Continental  to  $67.9  million.  Prupac's  obligations  are  guaranteed  by The
Prudential.

11.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

The components of comprehensive income for the periods ending December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000 are shown in the following table:



                                      F-25

The  following  table shows the  components of the change in  accumulated  other
comprehensive income for the years ending December 31, 2002 and 2001.



12.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

A.   DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS

The Company maintains both qualified and  non-qualified  defined benefit pension
plans for its U.S. employees. Generally, the Company computes the benefits based
on average earnings over a period prescribed by the plans and credited length of
service.  The Company was not required to fund  contributions  to its  qualified
defined  benefit  pension  plan for the years ended  December  31, 2001 and 2000
because the Company's  qualified plan was subject to the full funding limitation
under the Internal  Revenue  Service  guidelines.  The  Company's  non-qualified
defined benefit pension plan,  effected in October 1995,  provides  compensating
pension benefits for  participants  whose benefits have been curtailed under the
qualified plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations.

Although not required under Internal  Revenue  Service  guidelines,  the Company
contributed  $3.2 million and $2.0 million to the qualified,  and  non-qualified
plans  respectively  in 2002.  The  change in the  accumulated  pension  benefit
obligation  reflects the net effect of amendments  made to the plans during 2002
and 2001.  Pension  expense for the Company's plans for the years ended December
31,  2002,  2001 and 2000 were $3.6  million,  $1.6  million  and $1.0  million,
respectively.

                                      F-26

The following table summarizes the status of these plans:



Plan assets are comprised of shares in investment trusts with  approximately 77%
and 23% of the  underlying  assets  consisting  of equity  securities  and fixed
maturities, respectively.

Net periodic pension cost included the following components:



The weighted  average  discount  rates used to determine the  actuarial  present
value of the projected  benefit  obligation  for 2002,  2001 and 2000 are 6.75%,
7.0% and 7.5%, respectively. The rate of compensation increase used to determine
the actuarial present value of the projected  benefit  obligation for 2002, 2001
and 2000 is 4.50%.  The  expected  long-term  rate of return on plan  assets for
2002, 2001 and 2000 is 9.0%.

The Company also maintains both qualified and non-qualified defined contribution
plans ("Savings Plan" and "Non-Qualified  Savings Plan",  respectively) covering
U.S.  employees.  Under the plans, the Company contributes up to a maximum 3% of

                                      F-27

the  participants'  compensation  based on the  contribution  percentage  of the
employee.  The  Non-Qualified  Savings Plan provides  compensating  savings plan
benefits for  participants  whose benefits have been curtailed under the Savings
Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations.  The Company's  incurred expenses
related to these plans were $0.7  million,  $0.6  million  and $0.6  million for
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

In addition,  the Company maintains several defined  contribution  pension plans
covering non-U.S. employees. Each non-U.S. office (Canada, London, Belgium, Hong
Kong,  Singapore  and  Bermuda)  maintains  a  separate  plan  for the  non-U.S.
employees  working in that location.  The Company  contributes  various  amounts
based on salary, age, and/or years of service. The contributions as a percentage
of salary for the branch  offices  range from 2% to 12%. The  contributions  are
generally used to purchase pension benefits from local insurance providers.  The
Company's  incurred  expenses  related to these  plans were $0.4  million,  $0.4
million and $0.3 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

B.   POST-RETIREMENT PLAN

Beginning January 1, 2002, the Company established the Retiree Health Plan. This
plan provides  health care benefits for eligible  retired  employees  (and their
eligible  dependants),  who have elected  coverage to traditional  formula.  The
Company  currently  anticipates that most covered employees will become eligible
for these  benefits if they retire while  working for the  Company.  The cost of
these   benefits  is  shared  with  the   retiree.   The  Company   accrues  the
postretirement benefit expense during the period of the employee's service.

A health care  inflation  rate of 9.0% in 2002, was assumed to change to 8.0% in
2003; and then decrease one percentage  point annually to 5.0% in 2006; and then
remain at that level.

Changes in the assumed  health care cost trend can have a significant  effect on
the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percent change in the rate
would have the following effects on:



Benefit  expense  for this plan for the year ended  December  31,  2002 was $0.6
million.

                                      F-28


The following table summarizes the status of these plans:



Net periodic cost included the following components:



13.  DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS AND STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

A.   DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

Under Bermuda law,  Group is prohibited  from  declaring or paying a dividend if
such payment would reduce the  realizable  value of its assets to an amount less
than the  aggregate  value of its  liabilities  and its issued share capital and
share premium  (additional  paid-in  capital)  accounts.  Group's ability to pay
dividends  and its  operating  expenses is  dependent  upon  dividends  from its
subsidiaries.  The payment of such dividends by insurer  subsidiaries is limited
under  Bermuda  law and the laws of the  various  U.S.  states in which  Group's
insurance and reinsurance  subsidiaries are licensed to transact  business.  The
limitations  are generally  based upon net income and compliance with applicable
policyholders'   surplus  or  minimum   solvency   margin  and  liquidity  ratio
requirements as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory  accounting
practices.

Under Bermuda law,  Bermuda Re is prohibited from declaring or making payment of
a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum  liquidity
ratio.  As a  long-term  insurer,  Bermuda Re is also unable to declare or pay a
dividend  to anyone  who is not a  policyholder  unless,  after  payment  of the
dividend,  the value of the assets in its long-term  business fund, as certified
by its approved  actuary,  exceeds its liabilities for long-term  business by at
least the  $250,000  minimum  solvency  margin.  Prior  approval  of the Bermuda
Monetary  Authority is required if Bermuda Re's dividend  payments  would reduce
its prior year-end total statutory capital by 15.0% or more.


                                      F-29


Delaware law provides  that an  insurance  company  which is either an insurance
holding  company or a member of an insurance  holding system and is domiciled in
the state shall not pay dividends  without  giving prior notice to the Insurance
Commissioner  of Delaware and may not pay dividends  without the approval of the
Insurance Commissioner if the value of the proposed dividend,  together with all
other dividends and distributions  made in the preceding twelve months,  exceeds
the greater of (1) 10% of  statutory  surplus or (2) net income,  not  including
realized  capital gains,  each as reported in the prior year's  statutory annual
statement.  In addition,  no dividend may be paid in excess of unassigned earned
surplus.  At December  31, 2002,  Everest Re had $149.4  million  available  for
payment of dividends in 2003 without prior regulatory approval.

B.   STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Everest Re prepares  its  statutory  financial  statements  in  accordance  with
accounting  practices  prescribed  or permitted by the National  Association  of
Insurance   Commissioners   ("NAIC")  and  the  Delaware  Insurance  Department.
Prescribed  statutory  accounting practices are set forth in the NAIC Accounting
Practices and Procedures Manual. The capital and statutory surplus of Everest Re
was $1,494.0  million  (unaudited) and $1,293.8 million at December 31, 2002 and
2001,  respectively.  The  statutory  net income of Everest Re was $77.6 million
(unaudited),  $78.9 million and $165.3  million for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Bermuda Re prepares its statutory  financial  statements in conformity  with the
accounting principles set forth in Bermuda in The Insurance Act 1978, amendments
thereto and Related Regulations. The statutory capital and surplus of Bermuda Re
was $931.9 million (unaudited) and $451.9 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.  The  statutory  net  income  of  Bermuda  Re  was  $88.1  million
(unaudited),  $46.2 million and $21.2  million for the years ended  December 31,
2002, 2001, and 2000 respectively.

C.   CODIFICATION

The  Company's  U.S.  insurance  subsidiaries  file  statutory-basis   financial
statements  with the state  departments  of insurance in the states in which the
subsidiary  is  licensed.  On  January  1,  2001,  significant  changes  to  the
statutory-basis  of accounting became effective.  The cumulative effect of these
changes has been  recorded as a direct  adjustment  to  statutory  surplus.  The
cumulative  effect of these changes in 2001  increased  Everest  Re's  statutory
surplus by $57.1 million.

14.  CONTINGENCIES

In the  ordinary  course of  business,  the  Company is  involved  in  lawsuits,
arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute  resolution  procedures,  the
outcomes of which will  determine the  Company's  rights and  obligations  under
insurance and reinsurance  agreements and other more general contracts.  In some
disputes,  the Company  seeks to enforce  its rights  under an  agreement  or to
collect funds owing to it. In other matters,  the Company is resisting  attempts
by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. Such disputes are resolved
through formal and informal means, including litigation and arbitration.

In all such  matters,  the Company  believes  that its positions are legally and
commercially  reasonable.  The Company also regularly evaluates those positions,
and where appropriate, establishes or adjusts insurance reserves to reflects its

                                      F-30


evaluation.  The Company's  aggregate reserves take into account the possibility
that the Company may not ultimately  prevail in each and every disputed  matter.
The Company believes its aggregate reserves reduce the potential that an adverse
resolution of one or more of these matters,  at any point in time,  would have a
material impact on the Company's  financial  condition or results of operations.
However,  there can be no assurances that adverse resolutions of such matters in
any one period or in the aggregate will not result in a material  adverse effect
on the Company's results of operations.

The Company does not believe  that there are any other  material  pending  legal
proceedings  to which it or any of its  subsidiaries  or  their  properties  are
subject.

The  Prudential  sells  annuities  which are  purchased by property and casualty
insurance  companies to settle certain types of claim  liabilities.  In 1993 and
prior years, the Company,  for a fee,  accepted the claim payment  obligation of
these property and casualty insurers, and, concurrently, became the owner of the
annuity or assignee of the annuity proceeds. In these circumstances, the Company
would be liable if The Prudential were unable to make the annuity payments.  The
estimated  cost to  replace  all  such  annuities  for  which  the  Company  was
contingently  liable at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $150.5 million and $147.1
million, respectively.

The Company has purchased  annuities from an unaffiliated life insurance company
with an A+ (Superior)  rating from A.M. Best to settle certain claim liabilities
of the Company.  Should the life  insurance  company  become  unable to make the
annuity payments,  the Company would be liable for those claim liabilities.  The
estimated cost to replace such annuities at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $14.8
million and $13.7 million respectively.

15.  STOCK BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company has a 2002 Stock  Incentive Plan ("2002  Employee  Plan"),  its 1995
Stock  Incentive  Plan ("1995  Employee  Plan"),  its 1995 Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee  Directors  ("1995  Director Plan") and Board actions in 2001, 2000
and 1999 which award options to non-employee directors.  The Company implemented
FAS No. 123 in 2002, and related  interpretations  in accounting for these plans
and Board actions. Accordingly,  option compensation expense of $0.6 million has
been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in respect
of stock options granted under the 2002 Employee Plan.

                                      F-31


A summary of the status of the Company's  shareholder  approved and non-approved
plans as of December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000 and changes  during the years then
ended is presented in the following table:

Compensation Plans Approved by Shareholders:



The 2002 Employee Plan  replaced the 1995  Employee  Plan,  therefore no further
awards will be granted  under the 1995  Employee  Plan.  Under the 2002 Employee
Plan  4,000,000  common  shares  have been  authorized  to be  granted  as stock
options,  stock awards or restricted  stock awards to officers and key employees
of the Company.  At December 31, 2002,  there were  3,528,500  remaining  shares
available to be granted  under the 2002 Employee  Plan.  Under the 1995 Director
Plan,  a total of 50,000  common  shares have been  authorized  to be granted as
stock options to  non-employee  directors of the Company.  At December 31, 2002,
there were 38,145 remaining shares available to be granted.

                                      F-32


Compensation Plans Not Approved by Shareholders:



Compensation  plans not approved by shareholders refer to Board actions in 2001,
2000 and 1999 which awarded options to non-employee directors. The Board actions
were  designed  to award  non-employee  directors  with the  options to purchase
common stock to increase the ownership  interest in the Company of  non-employee
directors  whose  services are considered  essential to the Company's  continued
progress,  to align such interests with those of the shareholders of the Company
and to  provide  them  with a further  incentive  to serve as  directors  to the
Company.  Under Board actions in 2001,  2000 and 1999 a total of 40,000,  30,000
and 26,000  common  shares have been  granted as stock  options to  non-employee
directors of the Company.  There were no common shares  granted as stock options
to non-employee directors in 2002.

Options  granted under the 2002 Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at
20% per year over five years,  options granted under the 1995 Director Plan vest
at 50% per year over two years and options granted under the 2001, 2000 and 1999
Board actions vest at 33% per year over three years. All options are exercisable
at fair  market  value of the  stock at the date of grant and  expire  ten years
after the date of grant.  Restricted  stock granted under the 2002 Employee Plan
and the 1995 Employee Plan vests, beginning one year after the date of grant, in
equal annual installments over five years.

                                      F-33


The following table summarizes  information  about stock options  outstanding at
December 31, 2002:


In addition to the 2002 Employee  Plan, the 1995 Employee Plan and 1995 Director
Plan,  Group issued 2,248  common  shares in 2002.  Group issued 2,604 and 3,732
common shares in 2001 and 2000 respectively, and Holdings issued 1,780 shares of
treasury  stock in 2000.  These  issuances  had  aggregate  values of  $145,000,
$179,500 and $179,500 to the Company's  non-employee  directors as  compensation
for their service as directors in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Since its 1995 initial  public  offering,  the Company has issued to certain key
employees of the Company  66,100  restricted  shares of stock.  Upon issuance of
restricted shares,  unearned compensation is charged to shareholders' equity for
the cost of the restricted  stock and is amortized over the vesting period.  The
amount of earned  compensation  recognized as expense with respect to restricted
stock  awards  was  $339,994,  $114,708  and  $69,684  for 2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.  The Company  acquired  488 common  shares at a cost of $26,882 in
2002 from  employees  who chose to pay  required  withholding  taxes with shares
exercised  under the stock option  grants.  There were no such  transactions  in
2001.  Also in 2002 and 2001,  the  Company  recorded  contributions  of paid in
capital  in  the  amount  of  $0.7  million  and  $3.4  million,   respectively,
representing the tax benefits  attributable to the difference between the amount
of  compensation  expense  deductible for tax purposes with respect to the stock
awards and the amount of such  compensation  expense  reflected in the Company's
financial statements.

16.  RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

During the normal  course of  business,  the  Company,  through its  affiliates,
engages in reinsurance and brokerage and commission business transactions, which
management  believes to be at  arm's-length,  with  companies  controlled  by or
affiliated with its outside directors.  Such  transactions,  individually and in
the aggregate, are not material to the Company's financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

                                      F-34


17.  SEGMENT REPORTING

The  Company,  through  its  subsidiaries,   operates  in  five  segments:  U.S.
Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting,  International and Bermuda.
The U.S. Reinsurance  operation writes property and casualty reinsurance on both
a treaty and facultative basis through  reinsurance  brokers as well as directly
with ceding companies  within the United States.  The U.S.  Insurance  operation
writes  property  and  casualty   insurance   primarily  through  general  agent
relationships and surplus lines brokers within the United States.  The Specialty
Underwriting operation writes accident and health ("A&H"),  marine, aviation and
surety  business  within the United  States and  worldwide  through  brokers and
directly with ceding companies.  The International operation writes property and
casualty  reinsurance  through the  Company's  branches in London,  Canada,  and
Singapore,  in addition to foreign  business  written  through the Company's New
Jersey  headquarters  and Miami office.  The Bermuda  operation writes property,
casualty,  life and annuity  business  through  brokers and directly with ceding
companies.

These  segments  are  managed in a  carefully  coordinated  fashion  with strong
elements of central control, including with respect to capital,  investments and
support operations. As a result, management monitors and evaluates the financial
performance of these operating  segments based upon their  underwriting  gain or
loss ("underwriting results"). The Company utilizes inter-affiliate  reinsurance
and  such  reinsurance  does not  impact  segment  results,  since  business  is
generally  reported within the segment in which the business was first produced.
Underwriting  results  include  earned  premium  less  losses and LAE  incurred,
commission  and  brokerage  expenses  and  other  underwriting   expenses.   The
accounting  policies of the  operating  segments are generally the same as those
described in Note 1M, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

The Company  does not maintain  separate  balance  sheet data for its  operating
segments.  Accordingly,  the Company does not review and evaluate the  financial
results of its operating segments based upon balance sheet data.

The following tables present the relevant underwriting results for the operating
segments for the three years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

                                      F-36

The  following  table  reconciles  the  underwriting  results for the  operating
segments  to income  before tax as reported in the  consolidated  statements  of
operations and comprehensive income:



The Company produces  business in its United States,  Bermuda and  international
operations.  The net income and assets of the  individual  foreign  countries in
which  the  Company  writes  business  are  not  identifiable  in the  Company's
financial records.  The largest country,  other than the United States, in which
the Company  writes  business  is the United  Kingdom,  with  $224.5  million of
written  premium  for the  year  ended  December  31,  2002.  No  other  country
represented more than 5% of the Company's revenues.

Approximately  15.9%, 13.4% and 12.8% of the Company's gross premiums written in
2002, 2001 and 2000,  respectively,  were sourced through the Company's  largest
intermediary.
