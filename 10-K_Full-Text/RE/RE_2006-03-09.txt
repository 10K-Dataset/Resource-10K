PART I

Unless otherwise indicated, all
financial data in this document have been prepared using accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). As used in this document,
“Group” means Everest Re Group, Ltd. (formerly Everest Reinsurance Group, Ltd.);
“Holdings” means Everest Reinsurance Holdings, Inc.; “Everest Re”
means Everest Reinsurance Company and its subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise
requires); and the “Company” means Everest Re Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries,
except when referring to periods prior to February 24, 2000, when it means Holdings and
its subsidiaries.

ITEM 1. Business

The Company

Group, a Bermuda company, was
established in 1999 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. On February 24, 2000, a
corporate restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding company of
Holdings, which remains the holding company for the Company’s U.S. based operations.
Holders of shares of common stock of Holdings automatically became holders of the same
number of common shares of Group. Prior to the restructuring, Group had no significant
assets or capitalization and had not engaged in any business or prior activities other
than in connection with the restructuring.

In connection with the restructuring,
Group established a Bermuda-based reinsurance subsidiary, Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda),
Ltd. (“Bermuda Re”), which commenced business in the second half of 2000. Group
also formed Everest Global Services, Inc., a Delaware subsidiary, to perform
administrative and back-office functions for Group and its U.S. based and non-U.S. based
subsidiaries.

Holdings, a Delaware corporation, was
established in 1993 to serve as the parent holding company of Everest Re, a Delaware
property and casualty reinsurer formed in 1973. Until October 6, 1995, Holdings was an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“The
Prudential”). On October 6, 1995, The Prudential sold its entire interest in the
shares of common stock of Holdings in an initial public offering (the “IPO”).

The Company’s principal
business, conducted through its operating subsidiaries, is the underwriting of reinsurance
and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and international markets. The Company had gross
written premiums in 2005 of $4.1 billion with approximately 76% representing reinsurance
and 24% representing insurance, and shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2005 of $4.1
billion. The Company underwrites reinsurance both through brokers and directly with ceding
companies, giving it the flexibility to pursue business based on the ceding company’s
preferred reinsurance purchasing method. The Company underwrites insurance principally
through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers. Group’s active
operating subsidiaries, excluding Mt. McKinley Insurance Company (“Mt.
McKinley”), which is in run-off, are each rated A+ (“Superior”) by A.M.
Best Company (“A.M. Best”), a leading provider of insurer ratings that assigns
financial strength ratings to insurance companies based on their ability to meet their
obligations to policyholders.

Following is a summary of the
Company’s principal operating subsidiaries:

•

Bermuda Re, a Bermuda insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Group, is registered in
Bermuda as a Class 4 insurer and long-term insurer and is authorized to write property and
casualty business and life and annuity business. Bermuda Re commenced business in the
second half of 2000. On January 1, 2004 Bermuda Re purchased the UK branch of Everest Re.
Bermuda Re’s UK branch provides property and casualty reinsurance to the United
Kingdom and European markets. Bermuda Re had shareholders’ equity at December 31,
2005 of $1.7 billion based on U.S. GAAP.


•

Everest International Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Everest International”), a Bermuda
insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Group, is registered in Bermuda as a Class 4
insurer and is authorized to write property and casualty business. Through 2005, all of
Everest International’s business has been inter-affiliate quota share reinsurance
assumed from Everest Re and the UK branch of Bermuda Re. Everest International had
shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2005 of $300 million based on U.S. GAAP.

•

Everest Re, a Delaware insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Holdings, is a
licensed property and casualty insurer and/or reinsurer in all states (except Nevada and
Wyoming), the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and is authorized to conduct
reinsurance business in Canada and Singapore. Everest Re underwrites property and casualty
reinsurance for insurance and reinsurance companies in the U.S. and international markets.
Everest Re had statutory surplus at December 31, 2005 of $2.3 billion.

•

Everest National Insurance Company (“Everest National”), a Delaware insurance
company and a direct subsidiary of Everest Re, is licensed in 47 states and the District
of Columbia and is authorized to write property and casualty insurance on an admitted
basis in the jurisdictions in which it is licensed. The majority of Everest
National’s business is reinsured by its parent, Everest Re.

•

Everest Indemnity Insurance Company (“Everest Indemnity”), a Delaware insurance
company and a direct subsidiary of Everest Re, writes excess and surplus lines insurance
business in the U.S. on a non-admitted basis. Excess and surplus lines insurance is
specialty property and liability coverage that an insurer not licensed to write insurance
in a particular jurisdiction is permitted to provide to insureds when the specific
specialty coverage is unavailable from admitted insurers. Everest Indemnity is licensed in
Delaware and is eligible to write business on a non-admitted basis in 49 states, the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The majority of Everest Indemnity’s business is
reinsured by its parent, Everest Re.

•

Everest Security Insurance Company (“Everest Security”), formerly Southeastern
Security Insurance Company, a Georgia insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Everest
Re, was acquired in January 2000 and writes property and casualty insurance on an admitted
basis in Georgia and Alabama. The majority of Everest Security’s business is
reinsured by its parent, Everest Re.

•

Mt. McKinley (f/k/a Gibraltar Casualty Company, “Gibraltar”), a Delaware
insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Holdings, was acquired by Holdings in
September 2000 from The Prudential. Mt. McKinley was formed by Everest Re in 1978 to write
the excess and surplus lines insurance business in the U.S. In 1985, Mt. McKinley ceased
writing new and renewal insurance and commenced a run-off operation to service claims
arising from its previously written business. In 1991, Mt. McKinley was distributed to its
ultimate parent, The Prudential. Effective September 19, 2000, Mt. McKinley and Bermuda Re
entered into a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement, whereby Mt. McKinley
transferred, for what management believes to be arm’s-length consideration, all of
its net insurance exposures and reserves to Bermuda Re.

Reinsurance Industry
Overview

Reinsurance is an arrangement in
which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance company,
the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the
ceding company under one or more insurance contracts. Reinsurance can provide a ceding
company with several benefits, including a reduction in net liability on individual risks
or classes of risks, catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses and assistance
in maintaining acceptable financial ratios. Reinsurance also provides a ceding company
with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write
more business than would be possible without a concomitant increase in capital and
surplus. Reinsurance, however, does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to
policyholders.


There are two basic types of
reinsurance arrangements: treaty and facultative reinsurance. In treaty reinsurance, the
ceding company is obligated to cede and the reinsurer is obligated to assume a specified
portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company. Treaty reinsurers do
not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties and,
consequently, after a review of the ceding company’s underwriting practices, are
largely dependent on the original risk underwriting decisions made by the ceding company.
In facultative reinsurance, the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part
of the risk under a single insurance contract. Facultative reinsurance is negotiated
separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance normally
is purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered by their reinsurance
treaties either for amounts in excess of the dollar limits of their reinsurance treaties
or for unusual risks.

Both treaty and facultative
reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis. Under
pro rata reinsurance, the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as
the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion. Under excess of loss reinsurance, the
reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and
expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount, known as the ceding company’s
retention or reinsurer’s attachment point, generally subject to a negotiated
reinsurance contract limit.

In pro rata reinsurance, the
reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission. The ceding commission
generally is based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the business being
reinsured (commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative
expense). Premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss
reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives
because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk. There is usually no ceding
commission on excess of loss reinsurance.

Reinsurers may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure. Reinsurance of a
reinsurer’s business is called a retrocession. Reinsurance companies cede risks under
retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers, known as retrocessionaires, for reasons
similar to those that cause insurers
to purchase reinsurance: to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks,
protect against catastrophic losses, stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional
underwriting capacity.

Reinsurance can be written through
intermediaries, generally professional reinsurance brokers, or directly with ceding
companies. From a ceding company’s perspective, both the broker and the direct
distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages. A ceding company’s decision
to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of
such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed.

Business Strategy

The Company’s business strategy
is to sustain its leadership position within its target reinsurance and insurance markets
and achieve an attractive return for its shareholders. The Company’s underwriting
strategies seek to capitalize on its i) financial strength and capacity; ii) global
franchise; iii) stable and experienced management team; iv) diversified product and
distribution offering; v) underwriting expertise and disciplined approach; vi) efficient
and low-cost operating structure and vii) prudent risk management approach to catastrophe
exposures and retrocessional costs. The Company’s strategies include effective
management throughout the property and casualty underwriting cycle.

The Company’s products include
the full range of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance coverages, including
marine, aviation, surety, errors and omissions liability (“E&O”),
directors’ and officers’ liability (“D&O”), medical malpractice,
other specialty lines, accident and health (“A&H”) and workers’
compensation. The Company’s product distribution includes direct and broker
reinsurance channels; U.S., Bermuda and international markets; treaty and facultative
reinsurance and admitted and non-admitted insurance.


The Company’s underwriting
strategy emphasizes underwriting profitability rather than premium volume, writing
specialized property and casualty risks and integration of underwriting expertise across
all business units. Key elements of this strategy are prudent risk selection, appropriate
pricing through strict underwriting discipline and continuous adjustment of the
Company’s business mix to respond to changing market conditions. The Company focuses
on reinsuring companies that effectively manage the underwriting cycle through proper
analysis and pricing of underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and performance
are compatible with its objectives.

The Company’s underwriting
strategy also emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions,
such as increased demand or favorable pricing trends. The Company believes that its
existing strengths, including its broad underwriting expertise, U.S., Bermuda and
international presence, strong financial ratings and substantial capital, facilitate
adjustments to its mix of business geographically, by line of business and by type of
coverage, allowing it to capitalize on those market opportunities that provide the
greatest potential for underwriting profitability. The Company’s insurance operations
complement these strategies by allowing the Company access to business that would not
likely be available to it on a reinsurance basis. The Company carefully monitors its mix
of business across all operations to avoid unacceptable geographic or other risk
concentrations.

Marketing

The Company writes business on a
worldwide basis for many different customers and for many lines of business, providing a
broad array of coverages. The Company is not substantially dependent on any single
customer, small group of customers, line of business or geographical area. For the 2005
calendar year, no single customer (ceding company or insured) generated more than 7.5% of
the Company’s gross written premiums. The Company does not believe that a reduction
of business from any one customer would have a material adverse effect on its future
financial condition or results of operations due to the Company’s competitive
position in the marketplace and the continuing availability of other sources of business.

Approximately 66.0%, 10.5% and 23.5%
of the Company’s 2005 gross written premiums were written in the broker reinsurance,
direct reinsurance and insurance markets, respectively. The Company’s ability to
write reinsurance both through brokers and directly with ceding companies gives it the
flexibility to pursue business based on the ceding company’s preferred reinsurance
purchasing method.

The broker reinsurance market
consists of several substantial national and international brokers and a number of smaller
specialized brokers. Brokers do not have the authority to bind the Company with respect to
reinsurance agreements, nor does the Company commit in advance to accept any portion of a
broker’s submitted business. Reinsurance business from any ceding company, whether
new or renewal, is subject to acceptance by the Company. Brokerage fees are generally paid
by reinsurers. The Company’s ten largest brokers accounted for an aggregate of
approximately 54.7% of gross written premiums in 2005, with the two largest brokers
accounting for approximately 17.8% (Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.) and 10.1%
(Willis Group, Ltd.) of gross written premiums, respectively. The Company does not believe
that a reduction of business assumed from any one broker would have a materially adverse
effect on the Company due to its competitive position in the market place, relationships
with ceding companies and the continuing availability of other sources of business.

The direct reinsurance market remains
an important distribution channel for reinsurance business written by the Company. Direct
placement of reinsurance enables the Company to access clients who prefer to place their
reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon the reinsurer’s in-depth
understanding of the ceding company’s needs.

The Company’s insurance business
is written principally through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers. In
2005, no single general agent generated more than 5% of the Company’s gross written
premiums. In June 2004, the Company received notification of termination with respect to
its contract with American All-


Risk Insurance Services, LLC, which accounted for
approximately 7.8% of the Company’s 2004 gross written premiums. Under the terms of
the contract, the agency continued to produce business exclusively for the Company through
October 15, 2004. The business produced under this relationship continued in force through
the policy expiration dates or cancellation.

The Company continually evaluates
each business relationship, including the underwriting expertise and experience brought to
bear through the involved distribution channel, performs analyses to evaluate financial
security, monitors performance and adjusts underwriting decisions accordingly.

Segment Information

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property
and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance
brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance
operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent
relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting
operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and
worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation
writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re’s branches in Canada and
Singapore, in addition to foreign business written through Everest Re’s Miami and New
Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide
property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and
directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and property and casualty
reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control with respect to
pricing, risk management, monitoring aggregate exposures to catastrophe events, capital,
investments and support operations. Management generally monitors and evaluates the
financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results.
Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses
(“LAE”) incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting
expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and
other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses,
commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by earned premium. The Company
utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance, but such reinsurance generally does not impact
segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in which the
business was first produced. For selected financial information regarding these segments,
see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re
sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re. Business for this branch was previously
included in the International segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to
the sale and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (“FAS
131”), the Company restated the International and Bermuda segments for the year ended
2003 to conform to December 31, 2005 and 2004 segment reporting.

In 2003, Everest National, another
subsidiary of the Company, opened a regional office in California to better serve its
western U.S. Insurance business. The business produced through this additional office is
included in the U.S. Insurance operation.

Underwriting Operations

The following five year table
presents the distribution of the Company’s gross written premiums segmented by its
U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda
operations. The premiums for each operation are further split as to whether the premium is
derived from property or casualty business and, for reinsurance business, whether it
represents pro rata or excess of loss business:



U.S.Reinsurance Operation.

The Company’s U.S. Reinsurance
operation writes property and casualty reinsurance, both treaty and facultative,
through reinsurance brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the
U.S. The Company targets certain brokers and, through the broker market,
specialty companies and small to medium sized standard lines companies. On a
direct basis, the Company targets companies that place their business
predominantly in the direct market, including small to medium sized regional
ceding companies, and seeks to develop long-term relationships with those
companies. In addition, the U.S. Reinsurance operation writes portions of
reinsurance programs for larger, national insurance companies.

In 2005, $571.0 million of gross
written premiums were attributable to U.S. treaty property business, of which 27.5% was
written on an excess of loss basis and 72.5% was written on a pro rata basis. The
Company’s property underwriters utilize sophisticated underwriting methods, which
management believes are necessary to analyze and price property business. Further, the
Company manages its exposure to catastrophe and other large losses by limiting exposures
to individual contracts and limiting aggregate exposures to catastrophes in any particular
zone.

U.S.
          treaty casualty business accounted for $610.9 million of gross written premiums
          in 2005, of which 13.3% was written on an excess of loss basis and 86.7% was
          written on a pro rata basis. The treaty casualty portfolio consists of
          professional liability, D&O liability, workers’ compensation, excess
          and surplus lines and other liability coverages. As a result of the complex
          technical nature of most of these risks, the Company’s casualty
          underwriters tend to specialize by line of business and work closely with the
          Company’s pricing actuaries.

The Company’s facultative unit
conducts business both through brokers and directly with ceding companies, and consists of
four underwriting units representing property, casualty, specialty and national brokerage
lines of business. Business is written from a facultative headquarters office in New York
and satellite offices in Chicago and Oakland. In 2005, $53.5 million, $105.1 million,
$19.3 million and $26.3 million of gross written premiums were attributable to the
property, casualty, specialty and national brokerage lines of business, respectively.

In 2005, 89.3%, 8.4% and 2.3% of the
U.S. Reinsurance operation’s gross written premiums were written in the broker
reinsurance, direct reinsurance and insurance markets, respectively.

U.S.
          Insurance Operation.

In 2005, the Company’s U.S. Insurance
          operation wrote $932.5 million of gross written premiums, of which 78.9% was
          casualty, predominantly workers’ compensation insurance, and 21.1% was
          property. Of the total business written, Everest National wrote $716.6 million
          and Everest Re wrote $5.6 million, principally targeting commercial property and
          casualty business written through general agency relationships with program
          administrators. Workers’ compensation business accounted for $412.3
          million, or 44.2% of the total business written, including $230.3 million, or
          55.9% of the total workers’ compensation business written as California
          workers’ compensation business and $520.2 million, or 55.8% of the total
          business written as non-workers’ compensation business. Everest Indemnity
          wrote $183.4 million, principally targeting excess and surplus lines insurance
          business written through surplus lines brokers. Everest Security wrote $26.8
          million, principally targeting non-standard auto business written through retail
          agency relationships. With respect to insurance written through general agents
          and surplus lines brokers, the Company supplements the initial underwriting
          process with periodic claims, underwriting and operational reviews and ongoing
          monitoring.

Specialty Underwriting
Operation.

The Company’s Specialty Underwriting operation writes
A&H, marine, aviation and surety reinsurance. The A&H unit primarily focuses on
health reinsurance of traditional indemnity plans, self-insured health plans, accident
coverages and specialty medical plans. The marine and aviation unit focuses on ceding
companies with a particular expertise in marine and aviation business. The marine and
aviation business is written primarily through brokers and contains a significant
international component written


primarily in the London market. Surety business
underwritten by the Company consists mainly of reinsurance of contract surety bonds.

Gross written premiums of the A&H
unit in 2005 totaled $136.5 million, of which 88.1% was written through the broker market
and 11.9% was written through the direct market.

Gross written premiums of the marine
and aviation unit in 2005 totaled $121.0 million, substantially all of which was written
on a treaty basis and sourced through reinsurance brokers. Marine treaties represented
64.3% of marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2005 and consisted mainly of hull
and energy coverage. Approximately 35.9% of the marine unit premiums in 2005 were written
on a pro rata basis and 64.1% as excess of loss. Aviation premiums accounted for 35.7% of
marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2005 and included reinsurance for airlines
and general aviation. Approximately 70.9% of the aviation unit’s premiums in 2005
were written on a pro rata basis and 29.1% as excess of loss.

In 2005, gross written premiums of
the surety unit totaled $57.1 million. Approximately 98.8% of the surety unit premiums in
2005 were written on a pro rata basis and 1.2% on an excess of loss basis. Most of the
portfolio is reinsurance of contract surety bonds written directly with ceding companies,
with the remainder being credit reinsurance, mostly in international markets.

International
Operation.

The Company’s International operation aims to capitalize on
the growth opportunities in the international reinsurance markets. The Company targets
several international markets, including: Canada, with a branch in Toronto; Asia, with a
branch in Singapore; and Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, which business is
serviced from Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices. The Company also writes
“home-foreign” business, which provides reinsurance on the international
portfolios of U.S. insurers, from New Jersey. Approximately 82.3% of the gross written
premiums by the Company’s international underwriters in 2005 represented property
business, while 17.7% represented casualty business. As with its U.S. operations, the
Company’s International operation focuses on financially sound companies that have
strong management and underwriting discipline and expertise. Approximately 69.8% of the
Company’s international business was written through brokers, with 30.2% written
directly with ceding companies.

Gross written premiums of the
Company’s Canadian branch totaled $129.2 million in 2005 and consisted of pro rata
property (30.1%), excess property (27.1%), pro rata casualty (9.9%) and excess casualty
(32.9%). Approximately 70.7% of the Canadian premiums consisted of treaty reinsurance,
while 29.3% was facultative reinsurance.

The Company’s Singapore branch
covers the Asian markets and accounted for $187.1 million of gross written premiums in
2005. This business consisted of pro rata property (69.6%), excess property (25.3%), pro
rata casualty (4.2%) and excess casualty (0.9%).

International business written out of
Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices accounted for $388.6 million of gross
written premiums in 2005 and consisted of pro rata treaty property (64.8%), pro rata
treaty casualty (11.5%), excess treaty property (13.2%), excess treaty casualty (3.3%) and
excess facultative property and casualty (7.2%). Of this international business, 58.0% was
sourced from Latin America, 23.0% was sourced from the Middle East, 9.9% was sourced from
Africa, 6.7% was “home-foreign” business, 2.0% was sourced from Asia and 0.4%
was sourced from Europe.

Bermuda Operation.

The Company’s Bermuda operation writes property and casualty and is licensed to
write life and annuity business through Bermuda Re and property and casualty reinsurance
through its UK branch. In 2005, the Bermuda operation had gross property and casualty
written premiums of $293.7 million accounting for virtually all of its business, of which
$77.5 million or 26.4% was facultative reinsurance or individual risk insurance and $216.2
million or 73.6% was treaty reinsurance.


In 2005, the Company’s gross written
premiums by the UK branch of Bermuda Re totaled $475.0 million and consisted of pro rata
property (44.4%), excess property (15.6%), pro rata casualty (26.2%) and excess casualty
(13.8%). All of the UK branch’s gross written premiums related to treaty reinsurance.

Geographic Areas

The Company conducts its business in
Bermuda, the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. For select financial information
about geographic areas, see Note 18 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Risks attendant to the foreign operations of the Company parallel those attendant to the
U.S. operations of the Company, with the primary exception of foreign exchange risks. For
more information about the risks, see ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Safe Harbor
Disclosure”.

Underwriting

The Company offers ceding companies
full service capability, including actuarial, claims, accounting and systems support,
either directly or through the broker community. The Company’s capacity for both
property and casualty risks allows it to underwrite entire contracts or major portions
thereof that might otherwise need to be syndicated among several reinsurers. The
Company’s strategy is to act as “lead” reinsurer in many of the reinsurance
treaties it underwrites. The lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the
largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in a stronger position to negotiate price,
terms and conditions than is a reinsurer that takes a smaller position. Management
believes this strategy enables it to more effectively influence the terms and conditions
of the treaties on which it participates. When the Company does not lead the treaty, it
may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty. The Company may decline to
participate in a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors.

The Company’s treaty
underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among the Company’s underwriters,
actuaries and claim staff. Treaties are reviewed for compliance with the Company’s
general underwriting standards and certain larger treaties are evaluated in part based
upon actuarial analyses by the Company. The actuarial models used in such analyses are
tailored in each case to the exposures and experience underlying the specific treaty and
the loss experience for the risks covered by such treaties. The Company does not
separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties. The Company
does, however, generally evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to
determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty. The Company, when appropriate,
also conducts underwriting, operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding
companies to ensure that the ceding companies operate within such guidelines. Underwriting
audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff, the selection and pricing of risks
and the capability of monitoring price levels over time. Claim audits, when appropriate,
are performed in order to evaluate the client’s claims handling abilities and
practices.

The Company’s facultative
underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks, limits and
maximum risk exposures. Specified classes of large premium U.S. risks are referred to
Everest Re’s New York facultative headquarters for specific review before premium
quotations are given to clients. In addition, the Company’s guidelines require
certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits,
complexity or volatility, regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract.
Non-U.S. risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within
the involved operations.

The Company’s insurance
operations principally write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select
program managers. These programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the
program manager’s capabilities. The Company’s rates, forms and underwriting
guidelines are tailored to specific risk types. The Company’s underwriting,
actuarial, claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to
establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate
results monitoring mechanisms.


Risk Management of
Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements

Underwriting Risk and
Accumulation Controls.

Guidelines have been established for each segment
and underlying business unit to manage its underwriting risk. These guidelines place
dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors,
including ceding company profile, line of business, geographical location and risk
hazards. In each case, those guidelines permit limited exceptions, which must be
authorized by the Company’s senior management. These guidelines are regularly
reviewed to attune them to business unit market conditions, including risk versus reward
considerations, as well as the Company’s business portfolio management activities.

The operating results and financial
condition of the Company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses
stemming from its more volatile lines of business, particularly those that are
catastrophe-exposed. The Company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large
losses by:

•        selective underwriting practices;

•        diversifying its risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business;

•        limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone;

•        purchasing  retrocessional  protection  to the  extent  that such  coverage  can be secured in a  cost-efficient  manner.  See
         "Retrocession Arrangements".

Like other insurance and reinsurance
companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single
occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other
catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. Any such catastrophic event could
generate insured losses in one or more of the Company’s reinsurance treaties,
facultative certificates, or across lines of business, including property and/or casualty.

The Company focuses on potential
portfolio losses that can be generated by any single event as part of its evaluation and
monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly, the Company
employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single
catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These techniques range from non-modeled
deterministic approaches—such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in
catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic damage factors—to modeled approaches
that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation
techniques that provide insights into the frequency and severity of expected losses on a
probabilistic basis.

To date, there is not one universal
model capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographical
regions that the Company conducts business. In addition, the form, quality, and
granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not always
fully aligned with the data requirements for the Company’s licensed model(s) creating
potential imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the results from
multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate
potential losses by and across business units. Such combination techniques are inherently
difficult to apply and may affect the precision of the Company’s estimates. Also,
most models have not been accurate in forecasting losses from the unprecedented series of
hurricanes that impacted the insurance industry in 2004 and 2005. In particular, many
models did not fully consider some of the perils and factors, which have been major
contributors to the scale of events like the Katrina loss, such as flood, storm surge, and
potential demand surge. Finally, uncertainties with respect to future climate patterns and
cycles introduce significant uncertainty with respect to the accuracy of loss projections
from models using historic long-term frequency and severity data.

Nevertheless, when combined with
traditional risk management and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models continue
to be a useful tool for underwriters to price cat-exposed risks and for providing
management with quantitative analysis with regard to monitoring and managing its
catastrophe risk exposure by zone and risk hazard.


Projected losses with respect to
catastrophe events are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss
(“PML”). The Company defines PML as its anticipated loss, taking into account
contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous
geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake. The expected PML will
vary with the severity of modeled simulated losses and vary with the in-force book of
business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of “return
periods”, such as “100-year events” and “250-year events”. Simply
speaking, a 100-year PML corresponds to a 1% probability that losses from an event could
exceed the indicated PML; alternatively, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss
distribution for an event falls below the indicated PML. It is important to note that PMLs
are estimates derived quantitatively, with qualitative input as well, and that the events
modeled are hypothetical events from a stochastic model. As a result, there can be no
assurance that any actual event(s) will align with the modeled event(s) or that actual
losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled
event PML.

From a risk management perspective,
the Company continues to manage its catastrophe risk such that its largest individual
100-year event, on an after-tax basis, generally does not exceed approximately one-half of
projected net income. Management also monitors its largest PMLs at multiple points along
the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1,000
year return periods. This monitoring procedure enables management to identify discrete
risk zone and risk hazard exposure accumulations for integration into risk, underwriting
and capital management processes.

The Company’s catastrophe loss
projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a
formal risk management review process. The table below reflects the Company’s pre-tax
PMLs at various return times for its top three zones/perils (as ranked by the largest 1 in
100 year events) based on loss projection data as of January 1, 2006:

The above PML table is both gross and
net of retrocessional coverage. While the Company considers purchasing corporate level
retrocessional protection by evaluating the underlying exposures in comparison to the
availability of cost-effective protection, there was no retrocessional coverage in place
at January 1, 2006. The Company continues to evaluate the availability and cost of various
retrocessional products and approaches in the marketplace.

The impact of income taxes on the PML
losses depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also
affected by inter-affiliate reinsurance. Using the 1 in 100 PML for a windstorm in the
southeastern United States with a pre-tax loss of $532 million, the estimated after-tax
loss would be $415 million.

The Company believes that its methods
of monitoring, analyzing and managing catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk
management framework, which can be integrated with its underwriting business and capital
management activities. However, there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the
models, risk management framework and underlying exposures. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the Company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed
the PML or other return period projections, including events impacting multiple zones,
perhaps by a material amount. Nor can there be assurance that the


Company will not
experience multiple severe events that could, in aggregate, exceed the Company’s PML
expectations by a significant amount.

Terrorism Risk.

The Company does not have significant exposure to losses from terrorism
risk. Reinsurance contracts generally exclude losses arising from terrorism, except where
such coverage has been specifically included in the underwriting and pricing of the
involved reinsurance. While the Company writes some reinsurance contracts covering
terrorists’ events, the Company’s risk management philosophy is to limit the
amount of coverage provided and specifically not provide terrorism coverage for properties
or in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists. Although providing terrorism
coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable, most insurance policies mandate inclusion
of terrorism coverage. As a result, the Company is exposed to losses from terrorism on its
U.S. insurance book of business, particularly its workers’ compensation policies;
however, the Company generally does not insure the large corporations or corporate
locations that would result in a large concentration of risk.

As a result of its limited exposure,
the Company does not believe the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 that was signed
into law November 2002 and amended in December 2005 has had or will have a significant
impact on its operations.

Retrocession
Arrangements.

The Company considers retrocessional agreements to reduce its
exposure on specific business written and potential accumulations of exposures across some
or all of the Company’s operations. Where reinsurance is purchased, the agreements
provide for recovery of a portion of losses and loss adjustment expenses from
retrocessionaires. The level of retrocessional coverage varies over time, reflecting the
underwriter’s and/or Company’s view of the changing dynamics of both the
underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets. All retrocessional purchasing decisions
consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing,
terms, conditions and availability of such coverage, with the aim of securing
cost-effective protection. No assurance can be given that the Company will seek or be able
to obtain retrocessional coverage in the future similar to that in place currently or in
the past.

The Company does not typically
purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific reinsurance business written,
but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent and/or cost-effective to reinsure
a portion of the specific risks being assumed. The Company also participates in
“common account” retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties
whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its
reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties. Common account retrocessional
arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating
companies, including the ceding company, with respect to the involved treaties.

The Company typically considers the
purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the U.S. Insurance
operation. The type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk
exposures, individual program exposures, aggregate exposures by line of business, overall
segment exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance. Facultative
reinsurance will typically be considered for individual accounts with large exposure and
quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for individual programs of business.
In evaluating the purchase of reinsurance for a line of business, the Company generally
seeks to limit exposure to individual claim severity as opposed to frequency.

The Company also considers purchasing
corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of
exposures. Such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the
availability of cost-effective retrocessional protection. For years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss
retrocession coverage that provided up to $175 million of coverage for each year. These
excess of loss policies provided coverage if Everest Re’s consolidated statutory
basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a specified attachment point for each year of
coverage. The attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included adjustable
premium provisions that effectively


caused the Company to offset, on a pre-tax income
basis, up to approximately 57% of such ceded losses. The maximum recovery for each year
was $175 million before giving effect to the adjustable premium. As of December 31, 2005,
the Company has ceded the maximum limits under all three contracts. The Company has not
purchased similar corporate level coverage subsequent to December 31, 2001.

Although certain of the
Company’s catastrophe and aggregate excess of loss retrocessions have terms which
provide for additional premiums to be paid to the retrocessionaire in the event that
losses are ceded, all aspects of the Company’s retrocessional program have been
structured to permit these agreements to be accounted for as reinsurance under Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance
of Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts”.

In connection with the Company’s
acquisition of Mt. McKinley in September 2000, the Company had coverage under an aggregate
excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by Prudential Property and Casualty
Insurance Company of Indiana (“Prupac”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Prudential. On October 31, 2003, LM Property & Casualty Insurance Company
(“LM”) completed its purchase of Prupac and its obligations from The Prudential.
The Prudential continues to guarantee LM’s obligation under this agreement. This
agreement covers 80%, or $160 million, of the first $200 million of any adverse loss
reserve development on the carried reserves of Mt. McKinley at the date of acquisition and
reimburses the Company as such losses are paid by the Company. Cessions under this
reinsurance agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at December 31,
2003.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company
carried as an asset $1,048.7 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses
ceded. Of this amount, $239.8 million, or 22.9%, was receivable from subsidiaries of
London Reinsurance Group (“London Life”), $171.5 million, or 16.4%, was
receivable from Transatlantic Reinsurance Company (“Transatlantic”), $160.0
million, or 15.3%, was receivable from LM and $100.0 million, or 9.5%, was receivable from
Continental Insurance Company (“Continental”). No other retrocessionaire
accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s receivables. Although management
carefully selects its reinsurers, the Company is subject to credit risk with respect to
its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve the Company of
its liability to insureds or ceding companies. See ITEM 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial
Condition”.

The Company’s arrangements with
both London Life and Continental are managed on a funds held basis, which means that the
Company has not released premium payments to the retrocessionaire, but rather retains such
payments to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire, records them as a liability,
credits interest on the balances and reduces the liability account as payments become due.
As of December 31, 2005, such funds had reduced the Company’s net exposure to London
Life to $115.4 million, effectively 100% of which has been secured by letters of credit,
and its exposure to Continental to $38.7 million.

Claims

Reinsurance claims are managed by the
Company’s professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial
loss reports and coverage issues, monitoring claims handling activities of ceding
companies, establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of
claims. In addition to claims assessment, processing and payment, the claims staff
selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim
procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies. Insurance claims, except those
relating to Mt. McKinley’s business, are generally handled by third party claims
service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the
Company’s professional claims staff.

The Company intensively manages its
asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) exposures through dedicated, centrally
managed claim staffs for Mt. McKinley and Everest Re. Both are staffed with experienced
claim and legal professionals that specialize in the handling of such exposures. These
units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account, responding to claim
developments with evaluations of the involved


exposures and adjustment of reserves as
appropriate. Specific or general claim developments that may have material implications
for the Company are regularly communicated to senior management, actuarial, legal and
financial areas. Meetings among these areas, claim management and senior management are
held at least quarterly to review the Company’s overall reserve positions and make
changes, if appropriate. The Company continually reviews its internal processing,
communications and analytics, seeking to enhance the management of its A&E exposures,
in particular in the context of changes in the landscape of asbestos claims and
litigation.

Reserves for Unpaid
Property and Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Significant periods of time may
elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the insurer
and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to
the insurer by the reinsurer. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and LAE, insurers
and reinsurers establish reserves, which are balance sheet liabilities representing
estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related
expenses on losses that have already occurred. Actual losses and LAE paid may deviate,
perhaps substantially, from such reserves. To the extent reserves prove to be insufficient
to cover actual losses and LAE after taking into account available reinsurance coverage,
the Company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to
earnings, which could be material in the period such recognition takes place. See ITEM 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Loss and LAE Reserves”.

As part of the reserving process,
insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the
impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect
future claim amounts, changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss
exposures and inflationary and general economic trends. While the reserving process is
difficult and subjective for insurance companies, the inherent uncertainties of estimating
such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer, due primarily to the longer time between
the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer, the
diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or
facultative contracts, the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information
regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies. In
addition, trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not
necessarily occur or affect liability development to the same degree in the future. As a
result, actual losses and LAE may deviate, perhaps substantially, from estimates of
reserves reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Like many other property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company has experienced adverse loss development
for prior accident years, which has led to adjustments in losses and LAE reserves. The
increase in net reserves for prior accident years reduced net income for the periods in
which the adjustments were made. There can be no assurance that adverse development from
prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have
a material adverse effect on net income.

Changes in Historical
Reserves

The following table shows changes in
historical loss reserves for the Company for 1995 and subsequent years. The table is
presented on a GAAP basis except that the Company’s loss reserves for its Canadian
branch operations are presented in Canadian dollars, the impact of which is not material.
The top line of the table shows the estimated initial reserves for unpaid losses and LAE
recorded at each year end date. The upper (paid) portion of the table presents the
cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year on those claims for which reserves
were carried as of each specific year end. The lower (liability re-estimated) portion
shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as
of the end of each succeeding year. The reserve estimates change as more information
becomes known about the actual claims for which the initial reserves were carried. The
cumulative redundancy/(deficiency) line represents the cumulative change in estimates
since the initial reserve was established. It is equal to the initial reserve less the
latest liability re-estimated amount.


Each amount other than the original
reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts
for prior periods. For example, if a loss settled in 1998 for $100,000, was first reserved
in 1995 at $60,000 and remained unchanged until settlement, the $40,000 deficiency (actual
loss minus original estimate) would be included in the cumulative redundancy/(deficiency)
in each of the years in the period 1995 through 1997 shown below. Conditions and trends
that have affected development of liability in the past are not indicative of future
developments. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or
deficiencies based on this table.


Five of the most recent six years on
the above table reflect cumulative deficiencies, also referred to as adverse development,
with the largest indicated deficiency in 2001. Three active classes of business were the
principal contributors to those deficiencies: professional liability reinsurance, general
casualty reinsurance and workers’


compensation insurance. In addition to these active
business classes, there has continued to be adverse experience on A&E reserves.

In the professional liability
reinsurance class, the late 1990s and early 2000s saw a proliferation of claims relating
to bankruptcies and other corporate, financial and/or management improprieties. This
resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims on the professional
liability policies reinsured by the Company. In the general casualty area, the Company has
experienced claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the Company’s
pricing and reserving assumptions, particularly for accident years 1999 and 2000. This
experience reflects unfavorable trends in litigation and economic variability. With
respect to both of these classes, another factor was the increasingly competitive
conditions in insurance and reinsurance markets during this period. While the Company
seeks to manage the impact of competitive condition changes on its results, it is
generally unable to insulate itself entirely from the underlying industry cycles of its
principal business. See ITEM 1, “Business – Competition”.

In the workers’ compensation
insurance class, the majority of which was written in California, the Company has
experienced adverse development primarily for accident years 2001 and 2002 due to higher
than expected claim frequency and severity. As a result of significant growth in this book
of business in a challenging business environment, the Company’s writings in this
class were subject to more relative variability than are some of its established and/or
stable lines of business. Although, cumulative results through 2005 continue to be quite
profitable for this book of business, there has been some deterioration in claim frequency
and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002.

Management believes that adequate
provision has been made for the Company’s loss and LAE reserves. While there can be
no assurance that reserves for and losses from these claims will not increase in the
future, management believes that the Company’s existing reserves, reserving
methodologies and retrocessional arrangements lessen the likelihood that any such
increases would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. These statements regarding the Company’s loss
reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities
laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein. See
ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations – Safe Harbor Disclosure”.


The following table is derived from
the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table above and summarizes the effect of reserve
re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations by accident year for the
same ten year period ended December 31, 2005. Each column represents the amount of net
reserve re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to
which the re-estimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on
the far right represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates for the indicated accident
years.

Since the Company has operations in
many countries, part of the Company’s loss and LAE reserves are in foreign currencies
and translated to U.S. dollars for each reporting period. Fluctuations in the exchange
rates for the currencies, period over period, affect the U.S. dollar amount of outstanding
reserves. The translation adjustment line at the bottom of the table eliminates the impact
of the exchange fluctuations from the reserve re-estimates.

The reserve development by accident
year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors discussed
above that caused the deficiencies shown in the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table. The
unfavorable development experienced in the 1998 through 2001 accident years relates
principally to casualty reinsurance, including professional liability classes and
workers’ compensation insurance where, in retrospect, the Company’s initial
estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated
variability in the underlying exposures. The favorable development for accident years 2002
through 2004 relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property
reinsurance business.

The Company’s loss reserving
methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends,
seeking, on a timely basis, to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to
factor the impact of such shifts into its underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis.


The following table presents a
reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve balances for the years indicated on a GAAP
basis:

Prior year incurred losses were $26.4
million favorable in 2005 and $249.4 million and $196.8 million unfavorable in 2004 and
2003, respectively. Such losses were the result of the reserve development noted above, as
well as inherent uncertainty in establishing loss and LAE reserves.

Reserves for Asbestos and
Environmental Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

As of year end 2005, 7.1% of reserves
reflect an estimate for the Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims for which
ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. The
Company’s A&E liabilities stem from Mt. McKinley’s direct insurance business
and Everest Re’s assumed reinsurance business. There are significant uncertainties in
estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E claims. See ITEM
7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Asbestos and Environmental Exposures” and Note 3 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mt.
          McKinley’s book of direct A&E exposed insurance is relatively small and
          homogenous. It also arises from a limited period, effective 1978 to 1984. The
          book is based principally on excess liability policies, thereby limiting
          exposure analysis to a limited number of policies and forms. As a result of this
          focused structure, the Company believes that it is able to comprehensively
          analyze its exposures, allowing it to identify, analyze and actively monitor
          those claims which have unusual exposure, including policies in which it may be
          exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non-products asbestos
          claims.

The Company aims to be actively
engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to Mt.
McKinley. Such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement, negotiation,
litigation, or the monitoring of claim activity under Settlement in Place
(“SIP”) agreements. SIP agreements generally condition an insurer’s payment
upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other
measures to control the insurer’s payments. The Company’s Mt. McKinley operation
is currently managing seven SIP agreements, three of which were executed prior to the
acquisition of Mt. McKinley in 2000. The Company’s preference with respect to
coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments,
because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty.

The Company has significantly
enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time, as well as
its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active. Those
insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous, but
still active management, with an emphasis on


monitoring those characteristics, which may
indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity. The Company continually focuses on
further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential
exposure of policyholders, including those that may not have reported significant A&E
losses.

Everest Re’s book of assumed
reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of A&E exposed
relationships. It also arises from a limited period, effectively 1977 to 1984. Because the
book of business is relatively concentrated and the Company has been managing the A&E
exposures for many years, its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have
generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to
generate future liabilities. The Company’s claim staff has developed familiarity both
with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling
and reserving practices of those companies. This level of familiarity enhances the quality
of the Company’s analysis of its exposure through those companies. As a result, the
Company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure, such
as non-products asbestos claims, for concentrated attention. However, in setting reserves
for its reinsurance liabilities, the Company relies on claims data supplied, both formally
and informally by its ceding companies and brokers. This furnished information is not
always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of the Company’s
ultimate loss projections.

The following table summarizes the
composition of the Company’s total reserves for A&E losses, gross and net of
reinsurance, for the years ended December 31:

Additional losses, including those
relating to latent injuries and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type
or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the Company or the industry, may emerge
in the future. Such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the
Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Future Policy Benefit
Reserves

Future policy benefit liabilities for
annuities are reported at the accumulated fund balance of these contracts. Reserves for
those liabilities include both mortality and morbidity provisions with respect to life and
annuity claims, both reported and unreported. Actual experience in a particular period may
be worse than assumed experience and, consequently, may adversely affect the
Company’s operating results for the period. See Note 1F of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


Activity in the reserve for future
policy benefits is summarized as follows:

Investments

The board of directors of each of the
Company’s operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy
and guidelines and, together with senior management, for overseeing their execution.

The policies and guidelines stress
diversification of risk, capital preservation, market liquidity and stability of income.
Beyond these fundamental objectives, the Company’s current investment strategy seeks
to maximize after-tax income, through a high quality, diversified, taxable bond and
tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of
liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted
continuously, consistent with the Company’s current and projected operating results,
market conditions and tax position. Additionally, the Company invests in equity
securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the
investment portfolio.

The Company’s investment
portfolio is in compliance with the insurance laws of the jurisdictions in which its
subsidiaries are regulated. Generally, an independent investment advisor is utilized to
manage the Company’s fixed income investment portfolio within the established
guidelines and is required to report activities on a current basis and to meet with the
Company periodically to review and discuss the portfolio structure, securities selection
and performance results. The Company directly manages its investments in its equity and
other invested asset portfolios.

The Company’s fixed income
investment guidelines include a general duration guideline of five to six years. The
duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the
payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayment of such security. This
investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management, which
considers economic and business factors, as well as the Company’s average duration of
potential liabilities, which, at December 31, 2005, is estimated at approximately 3.9
years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration
calculations.

The duration of the fixed income
portfolio at December 31, 2005 was 4.3 years, down from 5.2 years for the prior year. This
shortened duration mainly reflects the Company’s elevated short-term investment
holdings following the $758.3 million of net proceeds raised in connection with the
secondary common shares offerings in the fourth quarter. In addition, at various times
during the past three years the Company shortened duration in response to market interest
rate movements by purchasing interest only strips of mortgage-backed securities
(“interest only strips”). The interest only strips give the holder the right to
receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The
interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated
AAA. The ultimate cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average
life of the underlying mortgage pool. Generally, as market interest rates and, more
specifically, market mortgage rates decline, mortgagors tend to refinance, which will
decrease the average life of a mortgage pool and decrease expected cash flows. Conversely,
as market interest rates and more specifically market mortgage rates rise, repayments will
slow and the ultimate cash flows will tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these
investments tends to increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general
interest


rates fall. These movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate
movements on the Company’s other fixed income investments.

For each currency in which the
Company has established substantial reserves, the Company seeks to maintain invested
assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately comparable to the estimated
liabilities. Approximately 9.0% of the Company’s consolidated reserves for losses and
LAE and unearned premiums represent estimated amounts payable in foreign currencies.

The Company’s overall financial
strength and results of operations are, in part, dependent on the quality and performance
of its investment portfolio. Net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses)
on the Company’s invested assets constituted 13.5%, 11.7%, and 8.9% of the
Company’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company’s cash and invested assets totaled $13.0 billion at
December 31, 2005, which consisted of 89.4% fixed maturities and cash of which 97.5% were
investment grade, 8.4% equity securities and 2.2% other invested assets. The average
maturity of fixed maturities was 7.7 years at December 31, 2005, and their overall
duration was 4.3 years. As of December 31, 2005, the Company did not have any investments
in commercial real estate or direct commercial mortgages or any material holdings of
derivative investments, other than equity index puts discussed in Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash
flow difficulty to an extent that the Company’s management believes could threaten
the issuer’s ability to meet debt service payments, except where other than temporary
impairments have been recognized.

As of December 31, 2005, the
Company’s common stock portfolio, which is comprised primarily of publicly traded
equity index funds, had a market value of $1,090.8 million, comprising 8.4% of total
investments and cash.

Financial Strength Ratings

The following table shows the current
financial strength ratings of the Company’s operating subsidiaries as reported by
A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“Standard &
Poor’s”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”).
These ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be
considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in a direct or indirect
equity investment in an insurance or reinsurance company.

All of the below-mentioned ratings
are continually monitored and revised, if necessary, by each of the rating agencies.

The Company believes that its
ratings, in general, have become increasingly important to its operations because they
provide the Company’s customers and investors with an independent assessment of the
Company’s underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative
comparisons. Strong financial strength is particularly important for reinsurance
companies. Ceding companies must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered losses well into
the future. As a result, a highly rated reinsurer is generally preferred.

A.M.
          Best states that the “A+” (“Superior”) rating is assigned to
          those companies which, in its opinion, have a superior ability to meet their
          ongoing obligations to policyholders based on A.M. Best’s comprehensive
          quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company’s balance sheet
          strength, operating performance and business profile. The Company’s
          “A+” (“Superior”) rating is the second highest of fifteen
          ratings assigned by A.M. Best, which range from “A++”
          (“Superior”) to “F” (“In Liquidation”). Standard
          & Poor’s states that the “AA-” rating is assigned to those
          insurance companies which, in its opinion, have very strong financial security
          characteristics with respect to their ability to pay under its insurance
          policies and contracts in accordance with


their terms. The Company’s
          “AA-” rating is the fourth highest of nineteen ratings assigned by
          Standard & Poor’s, which range from “AAA” to “R”.
          Ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the use of a plus or minus sign to
          show relative standing of the insurer within those rating categories.
          Moody’s states that insurance companies rated “Aa” offer
          excellent financial security. Together with the Aaa rated companies, Aa rated
          companies constitute what are generally known as high-grade companies, with Aa
          rated companies generally having somewhat larger long-term risks. Moody’s
          rating gradations are shown through the use of nine distinct symbols, each
          symbol representing a group of ratings in which the financial security is
          broadly the same. The Company’s “Aa3” (Excellent) rating is the
          fourth highest of ratings assigned by Moody’s, which range from
          “Aaa” (Exceptional) to “C” (Lowest). Moody’s appends
          numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa
          through Caa.

Subsidiaries other than Everest Re
and Bermuda Re may not be rated by some or any rating agencies because such ratings are
not considered essential by the individual subsidiary’s customers or because of the
limited nature of the subsidiary’s operations. In particular, Mt. McKinley is not
rated because it is in run-off status.

Debt Ratings

The following table shows the debt
ratings by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s of the Holdings’
senior notes due March 15, 2010 and October 15, 2014 and Everest Re Capital Trust
(“Capital Trust”) and Everest Re Capital Trust II’s (“Capital Trust
II”) trust preferred securities due November 15, 2032 and March 29, 2034,
respectively, all of which are considered investment grade. Debt ratings are a current
assessment of the credit worthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific obligation.

A debt rating of “a” or
“a-” is assigned by A.M. Best where the issuer, in A.M. Best’s opinion, has
a strong ability to meet the terms of the obligation. The “a” and “a-”
ratings are the sixth and seventh highest of 19 ratings assigned by A.M. Best, which range
from “aaa” to “ccc”. A debt rating of “A-” is assigned by
Standard & Poor’s where the obligor has a strong capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation, although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher
rated categories. Standard & Poor’s assigns a debt rating of “BBB” to
issues that exhibit adequate protection parameters although adverse economic conditions or
changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to
meet its financial commitment on the obligation. The “A-” and “BBB”
ratings from Standard & Poor’s are the seventh and ninth highest of 24 ratings
assigned by Standard & Poor’s, which range from “AAA” to “D”.
According to Moody’s, a debt rating of “A3” is assigned to issues that are
considered upper-medium-grade obligations and subject to low credit risk. Obligations
rated “Baa1” are subject to moderate credit risk and are considered medium-grade
and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics. The “A3” and
“Baa1” ratings are the seventh and eighth highest of 21 ratings assigned by
Moody’s, which range from “AAA” to “C”.

Competition

The worldwide reinsurance and
insurance businesses are highly competitive, yet cyclical by product and market.
Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the Company
underwrites is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength
of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or
Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), underwriting expertise, the
jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity
and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and
insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and
experience in lines written. These factors operate at the individual market participant
level to varying degrees, as applicable to the specific participant’s circumstances.
They also operate


in aggregate across the reinsurance industry more generally,
contributing, in combination with background economic conditions and variations in the
reinsurance buying practices of insurance companies (by participant and in the aggregate),
to cyclical movements in reinsurance rates, terms and conditions and ultimately
reinsurance industry aggregate financial results.

The Company competes in the U.S.,
Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global
competitors. The Company’s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance
companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies,
reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international
underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s. Some of these
competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and have established
long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be a
significant competitive advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into
the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance
risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and
insurance capacity and competition.

In 2004 and 2005, market conditions
weakened following hard market conditions that had developed from 2000 through 2003.
Pricing for most property and casualty classes declined modestly. Competition increased
modestly as well, in part due to the relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers
from 2002 through 2004, the attendant buildup of capital by these participants and growing
pressures to effectively redeploy this capital. However, this profitability and capital
buildup varied significantly by market participant, reflecting the fact that the industry
was impacted by significant catastrophe losses in the second halves of both 2005 and 2004,
generally weak investment market conditions and ongoing adverse loss development. All of
these factors depressed the industry’s aggregate financial performance and
perceptions of individual insurer’s financial strength during the period.

For the insurance industry, 2005 was
a year of unprecedented catastrophe losses in terms of both frequency and severity, which
negatively impacted the financial results of a broad number of (re)insurance market
participants. The Company believes that the scope and scale of industry losses have helped
to stabilize the weakening that was taking place in many sectors and will lead to
generally improving market conditions during 2006 that are likely to vary by product and
market. For the property catastrophe and retrocession lines, the Company expects that
demand and pricing will increase the most as companies reassess their risk management
approach and rating agencies raise the required capital levels for many industry
participants. The Company believes that price increases for these two lines will be most
pronounced in peak catastrophe zones, such as the southeastern U.S. For remaining property
lines, there will likely be modest rate increases, while the casualty markets have
generally steadied and are expected to stabilize at adequate pricing levels in 2006 for
both insurance and reinsurance.

The Company notes that it continues
to see opportunities for profitable writings in a variety of classes and lines owing
mainly to the general adequacy of underlying pricing. However, the Company continues to
examine its view of price adequacy for property lines in light of 2005‘s
unprecedented catastrophe experience from both a frequency and severity perspective. This
reexamination is focused on several key factors including the magnitude and character of
catastrophe exposures, the level of required capital to support the Company’s
businesses from both the Company’s and rating agencies’ perspectives and the
actual and potential volatility and variability of results, by product, business class and
business unit, including with respect to the reliability of underlying statistical and
modeling techniques.

Employees

As of March 1, 2006, the Company
employed 670 persons. Management believes that its employee relations are good. None of
the Company’s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and the
Company is not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.


Regulatory Matters

The Company and its insurance
subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of the various
jurisdictions in which they conduct business, including essentially all states of the
U.S., Canada, Singapore, the United Kingdom and Bermuda. These regulations vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect ceding insurance
companies and policyholders by regulating the Company’s conduct of business,
financial integrity and ability to meet its obligations relating to its business
transactions and operations. Many of these regulations require reporting of information
designed to allow insurance regulators to closely monitor the Company’s performance.

Insurance Holding Company
Regulation.

Under applicable U.S. laws and regulations, no person,
corporation or other entity may acquire a controlling interest in the Company, unless such
person, corporation or entity has obtained the prior approval for such acquisition from
the Insurance Commissioners of Delaware and the other states in which the Company’s
insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled, currently California and
Georgia. Under these laws, “control” is presumed when any person acquires,
directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company. To
obtain the approval of any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file an
application with the relevant insurance commissioner disclosing, among other things, the
background of the acquirer and that of its directors and officers, the acquirer’s
financial condition and its proposed changes in the management and operations of the
insurance company. U.S. state regulators also require prior notice or regulatory approval
of material inter-affiliate transactions within the holding company structure. See
“Dividends”.

The Insurance Companies Act of Canada
also requires prior approval by the Minister of Finance of anyone acquiring a significant
interest in an insurance company authorized to do business in Canada. In addition, the
Company is subject to regulation by the insurance regulators of other states and foreign
jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business. Certain of these states and
foreign jurisdictions impose regulations regulating the ability of any person to acquire
control of an insurance company authorized to do business in that jurisdiction without
appropriate regulatory approval similar to those described above.

Dividends.

Under Bermuda law, Group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend
          if such payment would reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount
          less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its issued share capital
          and share premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts. Group’s ability to
          pay dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends
          from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries is
          limited under Bermuda law as well as the laws of the various U.S. states in
          which Group’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or
          deemed domiciled. The limitations are generally based upon net income and
          compliance with applicable policyholders’ surplus or minimum solvency
          margin and liquidity ratio requirements as determined in accordance with the
          relevant statutory accounting practices. As Holdings has outstanding debt
          obligations, it is dependent upon dividends and other permissible payments from
          its operating subsidiaries to enable it to meet its debt and operating expense
          obligations and to pay dividends to Group.

Under Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is
unable to declare or make payment of a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum solvency
margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is also unable to
declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless, after payment of the
dividend, the value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as certified by its
approved actuary, exceeds its liabilities for long-term business by at least the $250,000
minimum solvency margin. Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority is required if
Bermuda Re’s dividend payments would reduce its prior year end total statutory
capital by 15.0% or more. At December 31, 2005, Bermuda Re and Everest International met
their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant margin.

The payment of dividends to Holdings
by Everest Re is subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law. Generally, Everest Re may
only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus, which was $1,423.0 million at


December 31, 2005, and only after it has given 10 days prior notice to the Delaware
Insurance Commissioner. During this 10-day period, the Commissioner may, by order, limit
or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the Commissioner finds the insurer to be
presently or potentially in financial distress. Further, the maximum amount of dividends
that may be paid without the prior approval of the Delaware Insurance Commissioner in any
twelve month period is the greater of (1) 10% of an insurer’s statutory surplus as of
the end of the prior calendar year or (2) the insurer’s statutory net income, not
including realized capital gains, for the prior calendar year. Under this definition, the
maximum amount that will be available for the payment of dividends by Everest Re in 2006
without triggering the requirement for prior approval of regulatory authorities in
connection with a dividend is $232.8 million.

Insurance
Regulation.

Neither Bermuda Re nor Everest International is admitted
to do business in any jurisdiction in the U.S. Both conduct their insurance business from
their offices in Bermuda, and in the case of Bermuda Re, its branch in the UK. In Bermuda,
Bermuda Re and Everest International are regulated by the Insurance Act 1978 (as amended)
and related regulations (the “Act”). The Act establishes solvency and liquidity
standards and auditing and reporting requirements and subjects Bermuda Re and Everest
International to the supervision, investigation and intervention powers of the Bermuda
Monetary Authority. Under the Act, Bermuda Re and Everest International, as Class 4
insurers, are each required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda, to maintain a
minimum of $100 million in statutory capital and surplus, to have an independent auditor
approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority conduct an annual audit and report on their
respective statutory financial statements and filings and to have an appointed loss
reserve specialist (also approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority) review and report on
their respective loss reserves annually.

Bermuda Re is also registered under
the Act as a long-term insurer and is thereby authorized to write life and annuity
business. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is required to maintain $250,000 in statutory
capital separate from its Class 4 minimum statutory capital and surplus, to maintain a
long-term business fund, to separately account for this business and to have an approved
actuary prepare a certificate concerning its long-term business assets and liabilities to
be filed annually.

U.S.
          domestic property and casualty insurers, including reinsurers, are subject to
          regulation by their state of domicile and by those states in which they are
          licensed. The regulation of reinsurers is typically related to the
          reinsurer’s financial condition, investments, management and operation. The
          rates and policy terms of reinsurance agreements are generally not subject to
          direct regulation by any governmental authority.

The operations of Everest Re’s
foreign branch offices in Canada, and Singapore are subject to regulation by the insurance
regulatory officials of those jurisdictions. Management believes that the Company is in
material compliance with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business and
operations. Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re sold its United Kingdom branch to
Bermuda Re, a Bermuda insurance company and direct subsidiary of Group. Business for this
branch was previously included in the International segment and is now included in the
Bermuda segment. As a result of this transaction, Bermuda Re’s operations in the
United Kingdom and worldwide are subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority
(the “FSA”). The FSA imposes solvency, capital adequacy, audit, financial
reporting and other regulatory requirements on insurers transacting business in the United
Kingdom. Bermuda Re presently meets or exceeds all of the FSA’s solvency and capital
requirements.

Everest Indemnity, Everest National,
Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to regulations similar to the U.S.
regulations applicable to Everest Re. In addition, Everest National and Everest Security
must comply with substantial regulatory requirements in each state where they conduct
business. These additional requirements include, but are not limited to, rate and policy
form requirements, requirements with regard to licensing, agent appointments,
participation in residual markets and claim handling procedures. These regulations are
primarily designed for the protection of policyholders.


Licenses.

Everest Re is a licensed property and casualty insurer and/or reinsurer in
          all states (except Nevada and Wyoming), the District of Columbia and Puerto
          Rico. In New Hampshire and Puerto Rico, Everest Re is licensed for reinsurance
          only. Such licensing enables U.S. domestic ceding company clients to take credit
          for reinsurance ceded to Everest Re.

Everest Re is licensed as a property
and casualty reinsurer in Canada. It is also authorized to conduct reinsurance business in
Singapore. Everest Re can also write reinsurance in other foreign countries. Because some
jurisdictions require a reinsurer to register in order to be an acceptable market for
local insurers, Everest Re is registered as a foreign insurer and/or reinsurer in the
following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and the Philippines. Everest National is licensed in 47
states and the District of Columbia. Everest Indemnity is licensed in Delaware and is
eligible to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in 49 states, the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico. Everest Security is licensed in Georgia and Alabama. Mt.
McKinley is licensed in Delaware and California. Bermuda Re and Everest International are
registered as Class 4 insurers in Bermuda. Bermuda Re is also registered as a long-term
insurer in Bermuda and an authorized reinsurer in the U.K.

Periodic
Examinations.

Everest Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity, Everest
Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to periodic financial examination (usually every 3
years) of their affairs by the insurance departments of the states in which they are
licensed, authorized or accredited. Everest Re’s, Everest Security’s, Everest
Indemnity’s and Mt. McKinley’s last examination reports were as of December 31,
2003, while Everest National’s last examination was as of December 31, 2001. None of
these reports contained any material findings or recommendations. In addition, U.S.
insurance companies are subject to examinations by the various state insurance departments
where they are licensed concerning compliance with applicable conduct of business
regulations.

NAIC Risk-Based Capital
Requirements.

The U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(“NAIC”) employs a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a
property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in
light of its size and risk profile. The major categories of a company’s risk profile
are its asset risk, credit risk, and underwriting risk. The standards are an effort by the
NAIC to prevent insolvencies, to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance
companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments.

Under the approved formula, a
company’s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital (“RBC”).
If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no action is necessary. Below this threshold
are four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees
of authority over a domestic insurer as the ratio of surplus to RBC decreases. The mildest
intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions. The
most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated.

Based on their financial positions at
December 31, 2005, Everest Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity and Everest Security
significantly exceed the minimum thresholds. Since Mt. McKinley ceased writing new and
renewal insurance in 1985, its domiciliary regulator, Delaware, has exempted Mt. McKinley
from complying with RBC requirements.

Various proposals to change the RBC
formula arise from time to time. The Company is unable to predict whether any such
proposal will be adopted, the form in which any such proposals would be adopted or the
effect, if any, the adoption of any such proposal or change in the RBC calculations would
have on the Company.

Tax Matters.

The
following summary of the taxation of the Company is based on current law. There can be no
assurance that legislative, judicial, or administrative changes will not be enacted that
materially affects this summary.


Bermuda.

Under current Bermuda law, no income, withholding or capital gains taxes are
          imposed upon Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries. Group and its Bermuda
          subsidiaries have received an undertaking from the Minister of Finance in
          Bermuda that, in the event of any taxes being imposed, Group and its Bermuda
          subsidiaries will be exempt from taxation in Bermuda until March 2016.
          Non-Bermuda branches of Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the
          jurisdictions in which they operate.

Barbados.

Through December 31, 2004, Group maintained its principal office in Barbados
          and was registered as an external company under the Companies Act, Cap. 308 of
          Barbados and was licensed as an international business company under the
          Barbados International Business Companies Act, 1991-24. As a result, Group was
          subject to a preferred rate of corporation tax on profits and gains in Barbados
          and was exempt from withholding tax on dividends, interest, royalties,
          management fees, fees or other income paid or deemed paid to a person who is not
          resident in Barbados or who, if so resident, carried on an international
          business. No tax was imposed on capital gains. Effective January 1, 2005,
          Group’s principal office was relocated to Bermuda.

United States.

Group’s U.S. subsidiaries conduct business in and are subject to taxation in the
U.S. Non-U.S. branches of U.S. subsidiaries are subject to local taxation in the
jurisdictions in which they operate. Should the U.S. subsidiaries distribute current or
accumulated earnings and profits in the form of dividends or otherwise to Group, the
Company would be subject to withholding taxes. Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries believe
that they have operated and will continue to operate their businesses in a manner that
will not cause them to generate income treated as effectively connected with the conduct
of a trade or business within the U.S. On this basis, Group does not expect that it and
its Bermuda subsidiaries will be required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes other than
withholding taxes on certain investment income and premium excise taxes. If Group or its
Bermuda subsidiaries were subject to U.S. income tax; there could be a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

United Kingdom.

Bermuda Re’s UK branch conducts business in the UK and is subject to taxation in the
UK. Bermuda Re’s Bermuda operations believe that they have operated and will continue
to operate in a manner which will not cause them to be subject to UK taxation. If Bermuda
Re’s Bermuda operations were subject to UK income tax there could be a material
adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash
flow.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

The following risk factors, in
addition to the other information provided in this report, should be considered when
evaluating us. If the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors
materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common shares could decline
significantly.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR
BUSINESS

Our results could be
adversely affected by catastrophic events.

Like all property and catastrophe
insurance and reinsurance companies, we are exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events,
including weather-related and other natural catastrophes, as well as acts of terrorism.
Any


material reduction in our operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more
catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to meet our interest and
principal payment obligations. We define a catastrophe as an event that causes a pre-tax
loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least $5.0 million, before corporate
level reinsurance and taxes. Effective for the third quarter 2005, industrial risk losses
have been excluded from catastrophe losses, with prior periods adjusted for comparison
purposes. By way of illustration, during the past five calendar years, pre-tax catastrophe
losses, net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate
reinsurance programs, were as follows:

Calendar year

Pre-tax catastrophe losses


$ 1,485.7 million


$    390.0 million


$      35.0 million


$      30.0 million


$    213.7 million

Our losses from future
catastrophic events could exceed our projections.

As with most industry participants,
we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and
magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool. Based upon these loss projections, we may
choose to decline additional business in certain geographical areas, purchase
retrocessional coverage or take other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a
given geographical area from catastrophic events. These loss projections are
approximations reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes and actual
losses may exceed the projections by a material amount.

We focus on potential losses that can
be generated by any single event as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate
exposure to catastrophic events. Accordingly, we employ various techniques to estimate the
amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographical
areas. These techniques range from non-modeled deterministic approaches – such as
tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic damage
factors – to modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using
sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation techniques that provide insights into the frequency
and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis.

As a result of the significant
hurricane losses over the past two years, vendors for the statistical models are in the
process of recalibrating their models, which may have a material impact on potential loss
projections for us and the insurance industry.

If our loss reserves are
inadequate to meet our actual losses, net income would be reduced or we could incur a
loss.

We are required to maintain reserves
to cover our estimated ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses for both
reported and unreported claims incurred. These reserves are only estimates of what we
believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and
circumstances known to us. In setting reserves for our reinsurance liabilities, we rely on
claim data supplied by our ceding companies and brokers and employing actuarial and
statistical projections. This information is not always timely or accurate and can result
in inaccurate loss projections. Because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss
reserves and LAE, we cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these
estimates of losses and loss adjustment reserves. If our reserves are insufficient to
cover our actual losses and LAE, we would be required to increase loss reserves in the
period in which such deficiencies are identified which would cause a charge to our
earnings and a reduction of capital. By way of illustration, during the past five calendar
years, the reserve re-estimation process resulted in a decrease to our
pre-tax net income in four of the years:


Calendar year

Effect on pre-tax net income


$ 26.4 million increase


$ 249.4 million decrease


$ 196.8 million decrease


$ 103.1 million decrease


$ 10.3 million decrease

See ITEM 1, “Business —
Changes in Historical Reserves,” which provides a more detailed chart showing the
effect of reserve re-estimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years.

During 2005, there were three large
hurricane events, Katrina, Rita and Wilma, as well as other catastrophe losses, which
resulted in significant incurred losses to our Company. The unprecedented magnitude and
nature of these losses, the continuing lack of precise information from ceding companies
regarding exposures, the complexities surrounding claim adjusting and settlement
activities and the potential related regulatory and legal issues, as well as inflation in
repair costs due to the limited availability of labor and materials, all contribute to
uncertainty in the loss estimating process.

Our current estimate for these losses
is based on modeled information, underwriter analysis and judgments, client input and
discussion, event modeling and profiling of exposed limits. We expect it will be several
quarters before relative clarity emerges with respect to ceding companies’ underlying
losses. As a result, losses may ultimately be materially greater than our initial
estimated losses. Any future adjustments to estimated pre-tax catastrophe losses will have
an impact on incurred losses in the quarters during which such adjustments are made, and
such impacts could be material.

The difficulty in estimating our
reserves is significantly more challenging as it relates to reserving for potential
A&E liabilities. At year-end 2005, roughly 7% of our gross reserves were comprised of
explicit A&E reserves. A&E liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many
reasons, including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any
bodily injury or property damage, difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or
environmental contamination, long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating
liability for the asbestos or environmental damage. Legal tactics and judicial and
legislative developments affecting the scope of insurers’ liability, which can be
difficult to predict, also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for A&E
liabilities.

The failure to accurately assess
underwriting risk and establish adequate premium rates could reduce our net income or
generate a net loss.

Our success depends on our ability to
accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained.
If we fail to accurately assess the risks we retain, we may fail to establish adequate
premium rates to cover our losses and LAE. This could reduce our net income and even
result in a net loss.

In addition, losses may arise from
events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced. An example of an
unanticipated event is the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Neither the magnitude
of loss on a single line of business nor the combined impact on several lines of business
from an act of terrorism on such a large scale was contemplated when we priced our
coverages. In addition to unanticipated events, we also face the unanticipated expansion
of our exposures, particularly in long-tail liability lines. An example of this is the
ongoing expansion of the scope of insurers’ legal liability within the mass tort
arena, particularly for A&E exposures discussed above.

Decreases in pricing for property
and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce our net income.


The worldwide reinsurance and
insurance businesses are highly competitive, yet cyclical by product and market. These
cycles, as well as other factors that influence aggregate supply and demand for property
and casualty insurance and reinsurance products, are outside of our control. The supply of
(re)insurance is driven by prevailing prices and levels of capacity that may fluctuate in
response to large catastrophic losses and investment returns being realized in the
insurance industry. Demand for (re)insurance is influenced by underwriting results of
insurers and insureds, including catastrophe losses, and prevailing general economic
conditions. If any of these factors were to result in a decline in the demand for
(re)insurance or an overall increase in (re)insurance capacity, our net income could
decrease.

In 2004 and 2005, market conditions
weakened following hard market conditions that had developed from 2000 through 2003.
Pricing for most property and casualty classes declined modestly. Competition increased
modestly as well, in part due to the relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers
from 2002 through 2004, the attendant buildup of capital by these participants and growing
pressures to effectively redeploy this capital. However, this profitability and capital
buildup varied significantly by market participant, reflecting the fact that the industry
was impacted by significant catastrophe losses in the second half of 2004, generally weak
investment market conditions, and ongoing adverse loss development. All of these factors
depressed the industry’s aggregate financial performance and perceptions of
individual insurer’s financial strength during this period.

For the insurance industry, 2005 was
a year of unprecedented catastrophe losses in terms of both frequency and severity which
negatively impacted the financial results of a broad number of (re)insurance market
participants. We believe that the scope and scale of industry losses have helped to
stabilize the weakening that was taking place in many sectors and will lead to generally
improving market conditions during 2006 albeit variable by product and market. For the
property catastrophe and retrocession lines, we expect that demand and pricing will likely
increase the most as companies reassess their risk management approach and rating agencies
raise the required capital levels for many industry participants. We believe that price
increases for these two lines will be most pronounced in peak catastrophe zones, such as
the southeastern U.S. For remaining property lines there will likely be modest rate
increases, while the casualty markets have generally steadied and are expected to
stabilize at adequate pricing levels in 2006 for both insurance and reinsurance.

However, beyond 2006, it is possible
that market conditions could weaken again. In that regard, the capital strength of
industry participants, as supplemented by new capital raised, by both existing industry
participants and new opportunistic market entrants, could be perceived as sufficient to
support the industry’s aggregate exposures without requiring significant price
increases or any fundamental changes in the pricing of industry products. This development
could have a material and adverse effect on our future prospects for growth and
profitability. Further discussion of competitive issues can be found in ITEM 1,
“Business – Competition”.

If rating agencies downgrade the
ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, future prospects for growth and profitability could
be significantly and adversely affected.

Our active insurance company
subsidiaries currently hold financial strength ratings assigned by third-party rating
agencies which assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial strength of
insurers and reinsurers. Our active subsidiaries carry an “A+
(“Superior”)” rating from A.M. Best. Everest Re, Bermuda Re and Everest
National hold an “AA– (“Very Strong”)” rating from Standard &
Poor’s. Everest Re and Bermuda Re hold an “Aa3 (“Excellent”)”
rating from Moody’s. Financial strength ratings are used by client companies and
agents and brokers that place the business as an important means of assessing the
financial strength and quality of reinsurers. A downgrade or withdrawal of any of these
ratings might adversely affect our ability to market our insurance products and could have
a material and adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability.

During the last five years, no active
subsidiary of ours has experienced a financial strength rating downgrade. However, we
cannot assure that a downgrade will not occur in the future if we do not continue to meet
the


evolving criteria expected of our current rating. In that regard, several of the
rating agencies are in the process of modifying their approaches to evaluating
catastrophic risk relative to their capital and risk management requirements. Therefore,
we cannot predict the outcome of this reassessment or its potential impact upon our
ratings.

Consistent with market practice, much
of our treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or
seek collateralization of our obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a
certain threshold. The termination provision would generally be triggered only if a rating
fell below A.M. Best’s A- rating level, which is three levels below Everest Re’s
current rating of A+. To a lesser extent, Everest Re also has modest exposure to
reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding
liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade. That provision would also generally
be triggered only if Everest Re’s rating fell below A.M. Best’s A- rating level.

The failure of our insureds,
intermediaries and reinsurers to satisfy their obligations could reduce our net income.

In accordance with industry practice,
we have uncollateralized receivables from insureds, agents and brokers and/or rely on
agents and brokers to process our payments. We may not be able to collect amounts due from
insureds, agents and brokers resulting in a reduction to net income.

We are also subject to the credit
risk of reinsurers in connection with retrocessional arrangements because the transfer of
risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to the insured. In addition,
reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though they are able to do so. The failure of
one or more of our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would
impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and could cause us to incur a significant
loss.

If we are unable or choose not to
purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers, our net income could be reduced or
we could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss experience.

We are generally less reliant on the
purchase of reinsurance than many of our competitors, in part because of our strategic
emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in our business.
We try to separate our risk taking process from our risk mitigation process in order to
avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance. Thus, we generally evaluate,
underwrite, select and price our products prior to consideration of reinsurance. However,
our underwriters generally consider purchasing reinsurance with respect to specific
insurance contracts or programs, and our senior management generally considers purchasing
reinsurance with respect to potential accumulations of exposures across some or all of our
operations, where reinsurance is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or is
expected to have a positive cost/benefit relationship. Because we generally purchase
reinsurance only when we expect a net benefit, the percentage of business that we
reinsure, as indicated below, varies considerably from year to year, depending on our view
of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract period.






Percentage of ceded written premiums to gross written premiums

Changes in the availability and cost
of reinsurance, which are subject to market conditions that are outside of our control,
have thus reduced to some extent our ability to use reinsurance to tailor the risks we
assume on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance exposures across our
reinsurance operations. Because we have reduced our level of reinsurance purchases in
recent years, our net income could be reduced following a large unreinsured event or
adverse overall experience.


Our industry is highly competitive
and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future.

Our industry is highly competitive
and subject to pricing cycles that can be particularly pronounced. We compete globally in
the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous
competitors. Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies,
subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance
departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting
operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s.

According to Standard &
Poor’s, we rank among the top ten global reinsurance groups where 80% of the market
share is concentrated. The top twenty groups in our industry represent 95% of the
market’s revenues. The leaders in this market are Munich Re, Swiss Re (including
Employers Re), Berkshire Hathaway, Hannover Re, and syndicates at Lloyd’s. Relative
to us, some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have
established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which
can be a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to
entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance
and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential
reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition. We may not be able to compete
successfully in the future should there be a significant change to the competitive
landscape of our market.

We are dependent on
our
key personnel.

Our success has been, and will
continue to be, dependent on the ability to retain the services of existing key executive
officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss
of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain other
highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct
business. Generally, we consider key executive officers to be those individuals who have
the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling operations: Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, Joseph V. Taranto (age 57), President and Chief Operating
Officer, Thomas J. Gallagher (age 57), and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, Stephen L. Limauro (age 54). Of those three officers, we only have an employment
contract with Mr. Taranto. That contract has been previously filed with the SEC and was
most recently amended on August 31, 2005 to extend Mr. Taranto’s term of employment
from March 31, 2006 until March 31, 2008. We are not aware that any of the above three
officers are planning to leave Group or retire in the near future. We do not maintain any
key employee insurance on any of our employees.

Special considerations apply to our
Bermuda operations. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians, other than spouses of Bermudians
and individuals holding permanent resident certificates, are not permitted to engage in
any gainful occupation in Bermuda without a work permit issued by the Bermuda government.
A work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that, after a proper
public advertisement, no Bermudian, spouse of a Bermudian or individual holding a
permanent resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards for the
position. The Bermuda government places a six-year term limit on individuals with work
permits, subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees of
businesses with a significant physical presence in Bermuda. Currently, all seven of our
Bermuda-based professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by
the Bermuda government that expire at various times between March 2006 and December 2008.
This includes Mark de Saram, the chief executive officer of our Bermuda reinsurance
operation. In the event his work permit were not renewed, we could lose his services,
thereby adversely affecting our ability to conduct our business in Bermuda until we were
able to replace him with an individual in Bermuda who did not require a work permit or who
was granted the permit.

Our investment values and
investment income could decline as they are exposed to interest rate, credit, and market
risks.


A significant portion of our
investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and smaller portions consist of
equity securities and other investments. Both the fair market value of our invested assets
and associated investment income fluctuate depending on general economic and market
conditions. For example, the fair market value of our predominant fixed income portfolio
generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest
rates. The fair market value of its fixed income securities can also decrease as a result
of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of those securities
to deteriorate. The net investment income that we realize from future investments in fixed
income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates.

Interest rate fluctuations also can
cause net investment income from fixed income investments that carry prepayment risk, such
as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, to differ from the income
anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase. In addition, if issuers of
individual investments are unable to meet their obligations, investment income will be
reduced and realized capital losses may arise.

Because all of our fixed income
securities are classified as available for sale, temporary changes in the market value of
these investments as well as equities are reflected as changes to our shareholders’
equity. As a result, a decline in the value of the securities in our portfolio could
reduce our capital or cause us to incur a loss.

We have invested a growing portion of
our investment portfolio in common stock or equity-related securities. The value of these
assets fluctuate with equity markets. In times of economic weakness, the market value and
liquidity of these assets may decline, and may negatively impact net income and capital.
We also invest in non-traditional investments which have different risk characteristics
than traditional fixed income and equity securities. These alternative investments are
comprised primarily of private equity limited partnerships. The changes in value and
investment income/(loss) for these partnerships are more volatile than over-the-counter
securities.

The following table quantifies the
portion of our investment portfolio that consists of fixed income securities, equity
securities and investments that carry prepayment risk.

Further discussion of
market-sensitive instruments can be found in ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

—

Market
Sensitive

Instruments”.

We may experience foreign currency
exchange losses that reduce our net income and capital levels.

Through our Bermuda and international operations,
we conduct business in a variety of foreign (non-U.S.) currencies, principally the Euro,
the British pound, the Canadian dollar, and the Singapore dollar. Assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency
exchange rates. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and exchange rate fluctuations
relative to the U.S.


dollar may materially impact our results and financial position. In
2005, we wrote approximately 25.5% of our reinsurance coverages in non-U.S. currencies; as
of December 31, 2005, we maintained approximately 10.9% of our investment portfolio in
investments denominated in non-U.S. currencies. During 2005, 2004, 2003, the impact on our
quarterly pre-tax net income from exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of $3.9
million to a gain of $7.8 million. Further discussion of foreign currency rate risk can be
found in ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Market Sensitive Instruments”.

RISKS RELATING TO
REGULATION

Insurance laws and regulations
restrict our ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We are subject to extensive and
increasing regulation under U.S., state and foreign insurance laws. These laws limit the
amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our operating subsidiaries, impose
restrictions on the amount and type of investments that we can hold, prescribe solvency,
accounting and internal control standards that must be met and maintained and require us
to maintain reserves. These laws also require disclosure of material intercompany
transactions and require prior approval of “extraordinary” transactions. Such
“extraordinary” transactions include declaring dividends from operating
subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds. These laws also generally require approval
of changes of control of insurance companies. The application of these laws could affect
our liquidity and ability to pay dividends, interest and other payments on securities, as
applicable, and could restrict the ability to expand business operations through
acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries. In addition, we may not have or maintain all
required licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws
and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and
regulations. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with
applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or
temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily
penalize us. These types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
To date, no material fine, penalty or restriction has been imposed on us for failure to
comply with any insurance law or regulation.

Current legal and regulatory
activities related to the insurance industry, including investigations into contingent
commission arrangements and certain finite risk or non-traditional products could affect
our business and the industry.

The insurance industry has
experienced uncertainty and negative publicity as a result of current litigation,
investigations, and regulatory activity by various insurance, governmental, and
enforcement authorities, including the SEC, with regard to certain practices within the
insurance industry. These practices include the payment of contingent commissions by
insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents, the solicitation and provision of
fictitious or inflated quotes, and the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or
other non-traditional, loss mitigation insurance and reinsurance products.

At this time, it appears the effects
of these investigations will have more of an impact on specific companies being
investigated rather than the industry as a whole, with greater transparency and financial
reporting disclosures being required for the entire industry in these areas; however, the
future impact, if any, on our operation, net income or financial condition can not be
determined at this time.

RISKS RELATING TO
GROUP’S SECURITIES

Because of our holding company
structure, our ability to pay dividends, interest and principal is dependent on our
receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from our subsidiaries.


Group and Holdings are holding
companies, each of whose most significant assets consists of the stock of their operating
subsidiaries. As a result, each of Group’s and Holdings’ ability to pay
dividends, interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the
earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries
to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it. This ability is subject to general
economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Payment
of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating subsidiaries are
regulated by U.S., state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions, including
minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. Accordingly,
the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to
us and Holdings in the future, which could prevent us from paying dividends, interest or
other payments on our securities.

Provisions in Group’s
bye-laws could have an anti-takeover effect, which could diminish the value of its common
shares.

Group’s bye-laws contain
provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to
replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In addition,
these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might
consider favorable. The effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from
receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered
by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change
in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing
market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in
the future.

For example, Group’s bye-laws
contain the following provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect:

•

election of directors is
staggered, meaning that the members of only one of three classes of directors are selected
each year;

•

shareholders have limited
 ability to remove directors;

•

the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 9.9% of the common shares will
be reduced to 9.9% of the total voting power of the common shares;

•

the board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has
reason to believe that the transfer would result in:

i)  
                     any person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more than 5.0%
                    of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of Group,

ii)  
                     any person holding controlled shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the
                    issued and outstanding share capital of Group, or

iii)  
                     any adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to Group, any of its
                    subsidiaries or any of its shareholders;

•

Group also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholder’s common
shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or advisable to
avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if:

i)  
          any person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than 5.0% of
          any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of Group,


ii)  
          any person holds controlled shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the issued
          and outstanding share capital of Group, or

iii)  
          share ownership by any person may result in adverse tax, regulatory or legal
          consequences to Group, any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder.

The Board of Directors has indicated
that it will apply these bye-law provisions in such manner that “passive
institutional investors” will be treated similarly to investment companies. For this
purpose, “passive institutional investors” include all persons who are eligible,
pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b)(1) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to file a
short-form statement on Schedule 13G, but excluding any insurance company or any parent
holding company or control person of an insurance company.

Applicable insurance laws
may also have an anti-takeover effect.

Before a person can acquire control
of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance
commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled. Prior to granting
approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company, a state
insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the
applicant, the integrity and competence of the applicant’s board of directors and
executive officers, the acquiror’s plans for changes to the insurance company’s
board of directors and executive officers, the acquiror’s plans for the future
operations of the insurance company and any anti-competitive results that may arise from
the consummation of the acquisition of control. Because any person who acquired control of
Group would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries in the
U.S., the insurance change of control laws of Delaware, California and Georgia would apply
to such a transaction. This could have the effect of delaying or even preventing such a
change of control.

Investors in Group may have more
difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a U.S. corporation.

The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda
(the “Companies Act”), differs in material respects from the laws applicable to
U.S. corporations and their shareholders. The following is a summary of material
differences between the Companies Act, as modified in some instances by provisions of
Group’s bye-laws, and Delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for
investors in Group to protect their interests than investors in a U.S. corporation.
Because the following statements are summaries, they do not address all aspects of Bermuda
law that may be relevant to Group and its shareholders.

Alternate
Directors.

Group’s bye-laws provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that
each director may appoint an alternate director, who shall have the power to attend and
vote at any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not
personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director. Delaware law
does not provide for alternate directors.

Committees of the Board of
Directors.

Group’s bye-laws provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that
the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board
appoints, and those committees may consist partly or entirely of non-directors. Delaware
law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to
committees, but those committees may consist only of directors.

Interested
Directors.

Bermuda law and Group’s bye-laws provide that if a director
has a personal interest in a transaction to which the company is also a party and if the
director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity, either
at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors, then the company will not be
able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest
and the director will not be liable to the company for any profit realized from the
transaction. In addition, after a director has made the declaration of interest referred
to above, he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum
is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest, unless
disqualified


from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting. Under Delaware
law, an interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director
derived an improper personal benefit. Additionally, under Delaware law, a corporation may
be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the
following conditions is fulfilled:

•

the material facts as to the interested director’s relationship or interests are
disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes
the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors,

•

the material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the
transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a
majority of the voting shares; or

•

the transaction is fair
 to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified.

Transactions with Significant
Shareholders.

As a Bermuda company, Group may enter into business
transactions with its significant shareholders, including asset sales, in which a
significant shareholder receives, or could receive, a financial benefit that is greater
than that received, or to be received, by other shareholders with prior approval from
Group’s board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the
shareholders. In the case of an amalgamation, in which two or more companies join together
and continue as a single company, a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of
at least 75% of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of
directors, except in the case of an amalgamation with and between wholly-owned
subsidiaries. If
Group was a Delaware corporation, any business combination with an interested shareholder
(which, for this purpose, would include mergers and asset sales of greater than 10% of
Group’s assets that would otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course
of business) within a period of three years from the time the person became an interested
shareholder would require prior approval from shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of
Group’s outstanding common shares not owned by the interested shareholder, unless the
transaction qualified for one of the exemptions in the relevant Delaware statute or Group
opted out of the statute. For purposes of the Delaware statute, an “interested
shareholder” is generally defined as a person who together with that person’s
affiliates and associates owns, or within the previous three years did own, 15% or more of
a corporation’s outstanding voting shares.

Takeovers.

Under Bermuda law, if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and,
          within four months of the offer, the holders of not less than 90% of the shares
          that are the subject of the offer tender their shares, the acquiror may give the
          nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the
          terms of the offer. Within one month of receiving the notice, dissenting
          shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer. The burden is on
          the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its
          discretion to enjoin the transfer. The court will be unlikely to do this unless
          there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and
          the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders.
          Under another provision of Bermuda law, the holders of 95% of the shares of a
          company (the “acquiring shareholders”) may give notice to the
          remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms
          described in the notice. Within one month of receiving the notice, dissenting
          shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their shares. Within one
          month of the court’s appraisal, the acquiring shareholders are entitled
          either to acquire all shares involved at the price fixed by the court or cancel
          the notice given to the remaining shareholders. If shares were acquired under
          the notice at a price below the court’s appraisal price, the acquiring
          shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and
          return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder, who must then refund the
          purchase price. There are no comparable provisions under Delaware law.

Inspection of Corporate
Records.

Members of the general public have the right to inspect the public
documents of Group available at the office of the Registrar of Companies and Group’s
registered office, both in Bermuda. These documents include the memorandum of association,
which describes Group’s permitted purposes and


powers, any amendments to the
memorandum of association and documents relating to any increase or reduction in
Group’s authorized share capital. Shareholders of Group have the additional right to
inspect Group’s bye-laws, minutes of general meetings of shareholders and audited
financial statements that must be presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders.
The register of shareholders of Group also is open to inspection by shareholders without
charge, and to members of the public for a fee. Group is required to maintain its share
register at its registered office in Bermuda. Group also maintains a branch register in
the offices of its transfer agent in the U.S., which is open for public inspection as
required under the Companies Act. Group is required to keep at its registered office a
register of its directors and officers that is open for inspection by members of the
public without charge. However, Bermuda law does not provide a general right for
shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records. Under Delaware
law, any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporation’s shareholder list
and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that person’s
interest as a shareholder.

Shareholder’s
Suits.

The rights of shareholders under Bermuda law are not as extensive as
the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many U.S.
jurisdictions. Class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to
shareholders under the laws of Bermuda. However, the Bermuda courts ordinarily would be
expected to follow English case law precedent, which would permit a shareholder to bring
an action in the name of Group to remedy a wrong done to Group where the act complained of
is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of Group or illegal or would result in the
violation of Group’s memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, the court
would give consideration to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the
minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of
Group’s shareholders than actually approved it. The winning party in an action of
this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys’ fees incurred in
connection with the action. Under Delaware law, class actions and derivative actions
generally are available to stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and
actions not taken in accordance with applicable law. In these types of actions, the court
has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys’ fees.

Limitation of Liability of
Directors and Officers.

Group’s bye-laws provide that Group and its
shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have, individually or in
the right of the Company, against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in
the performance of that director’s or officer’s duties. However, this waiver
does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud or dishonesty. This
waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws.
Under Delaware law, a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation
provisions limiting the personal liability of its directors to the corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty. However,
these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or
omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, the authorization of unlawful dividends, stock repurchases or stock redemptions,
or any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit. Moreover,
these provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under U.S. federal securities
laws.

Indemnification of Directors
and Officers.

Group’s bye-laws provide that Group shall indemnify its
directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions, costs,
charges, liabilities, loss, damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of
any act done, concurred in or omitted in the conduct of Group’s business or in the
discharge of their duties. Under Bermuda law, this indemnification may not extend to any
matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in
relation to the company, as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to
appeal. Under Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes
a party to an action, suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer
if (1) the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and (2) if the action or
proceeding involves a criminal offense, the director or officer had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful.


Enforcement of Civil
Liabilities.

Group is organized under the laws of Bermuda. Some of our
directors and officers may reside outside the U.S. A substantial portion of our assets are
or may be located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. A person may not be able to effect
service of process within the U.S. on directors and officers of Group and those experts
who reside outside the U.S. A person also may not be able to recover against them or Group
on judgments of U.S. courts or to obtain original judgments against them or Group in
Bermuda courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S.
federal securities laws.

Dividends.

Bermuda law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend, or make a
          distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for
          believing that a company, after the payment is made, would be unable to pay its
          liabilities as they become due, or that the realizable value of a company’s
          assets would be less, as a result of the payment, than the aggregate of its
          liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. The share
          capital account represents the aggregate par value of a company’s issued
          shares, and the share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for
          issued shares over and above their par value. Under Delaware law, subject to any
          restrictions contained in a company’s certificate of incorporation, a
          company may pay dividends out of the surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of
          net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the
          preceding fiscal year. Surplus is the amount by which the net assets of a
          corporation exceed its stated capital. Delaware law also provides that dividends
          may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than
          the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a
          preference upon the distribution of assets.

RISKS RELATING TO TAXATION

If U.S. tax law changes,
our net income may be reduced.

In the last few years, some members
of Congress have expressed concern about U.S. corporations that move their place of
incorporation to low-tax jurisdictions. Also, some members of Congress have expressed
concern over a competitive advantage that foreign-controlled insurers and reinsurers may
have over U.S. controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by
U.S. insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions, including Bermuda.
Although the existing legislation that increases the U.S. tax burden on so-called
“inverting” companies does not apply to us, we do not know whether any similar
legislation disadvantageous to our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries will ever be enacted
into law. If it was enacted, the U.S. tax burden on our Bermuda operations, or on some
business ceded from our licensed U.S. insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers,
could be increased. This could reduce our net income.

Group and/or Bermuda Re may be
subject to U.S. corporate income tax, which would reduce our net income.

Bermuda Re.

The income of
Bermuda Re is a significant portion of our worldwide income from operations. We have
established guidelines for the conduct of our operations that are designed to ensure that
Bermuda Re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. Based on its
compliance with those guidelines, we believe that Bermuda Re should not be required to pay
U.S. corporate income tax, other than withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income.
However, if the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) successfully contended that
Bermuda Re was engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., Bermuda Re would be required to
pay U.S. corporate income tax on any income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of
the U.S., and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax. Even if the IRS successfully contended
that Bermuda Re was engaged in a U.S. trade or business, we believe that the U.S.-Bermuda
tax treaty would preclude the IRS from taxing Bermuda Re’s income except to the
extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that
subsidiary. We do not believe that Bermuda Re has a permanent establishment in the U.S. If
the IRS successfully contended that Bermuda Re did have income attributable to a permanent
establishment in the U.S., Bermuda Re would be subject to U.S. tax on that income.


Group.

We conduct our operations in a manner designed to minimize our U.S. tax
          exposure. Based on our compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that we
          generate only immaterial amounts, if any, of income that is subject to the
          taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., we believe that we should be required to pay
          only immaterial amounts, if any, of U.S. corporate income tax, other than
          withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income. However, if the IRS successfully
          contended that we had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing
          jurisdiction of the U.S., we would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax
          on that income, and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax. Prior to January 1,
          2005, our principal executive offices were located in Barbados and, as a result,
          even if the IRS had successfully contended that we had material amounts of
          income that was subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., we believe that
          the U.S.-Barbados tax treaty would have precluded the IRS from taxing our
          income, except to the extent that our income was attributable to a permanent
          establishment maintained by us in the U.S. Since we moved our principal
          executive offices out of Barbados as of December 31, 2004 and since the United
          States and Barbados recently made effective a protocol to the U.S.-Barbados tax
          treaty that strengthens the limitation of benefits provisions of that treaty,
          the U.S.-Barbados tax treaty will no longer provide any protection to us.
          Nevertheless, we doe not believe that we have material amounts of income subject
          to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S. If the IRS successfully contended,
          however, that we did have income subject to tax in the U.S., the imposition of
          tax on that income would reduce our net income.

If Bermuda Re became subject to U.S.
income tax on its income or if we became subject to U.S. income tax, our income could also
be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax. In that event, Group and Bermuda Re would be
subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as
U.S. corporations. The combined effect of the 35% U.S. corporate income tax rate and the
30% branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 54.5%. The imposition of these taxes
would reduce our net income.

Group and/or Bermuda Re may become
subject to Bermuda tax, which would reduce our net income.

Group and Bermuda Re currently are
not subject to income or capital gains taxes in Bermuda. Both companies have received an
assurance from the Bermuda Minister of Finance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax
Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda
that imposes any tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain
or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then that tax
will not apply to us or to any of our operations or our shares, debentures or other
obligations until March 28, 2016. This assurance does not prevent the application of any
of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda and does not prevent the
imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land Tax Act 1967
of Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to Group or Bermuda Re.
There are currently no procedures for extending these assurances. As a result, Group and
Bermuda Re could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which could reduce
our net income.

Our net income will be reduced if
U.S. excise and withholding taxes are increased.

Bermuda Re is subject to an excise
tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums it collects with respect to risks located in the
U.S. In addition, Bermuda Re may be subject to withholding tax on dividend income from
U.S. sources. These taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on
Bermuda Re’s business, which could reduce our net income.

Properties

Everest Re’s corporate offices
are located in approximately 129,700 square feet of leased office space in Liberty Corner,
New Jersey. Bermuda Re’s corporate offices are located in approximately 3,600 total
square feet of leased office space in Hamilton, Bermuda. The Company’s other twelve
locations occupy a total of approximately 74,500 square feet, all of which are leased.
Management believes that the above-described office space is adequate for its current and
anticipated needs.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business,
the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute
resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the Company’s rights and
obligations under insurance, reinsurance and other contractual agreements. In some
disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds
owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others to collect
funds or enforce alleged rights. These disputes arise from time to time and as they arise
are addressed, and ultimately resolved, through both informal and formal means, including
negotiated resolution, arbitration and litigation. In all such matters, the Company
believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. While the final
outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe
that any of these matters, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position or liquidity. However, an adverse resolution of one
or more of these items in any one quarter or fiscal year could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s results of operations in that period.

In May 2005, Holdings received and
responded to a subpoena from the SEC seeking information regarding certain loss mitigation
insurance products. The Company has stated that Holdings will fully cooperate with this
and any future inquiries and Holdings provided the requested information. Holdings does
not believe that it has engaged in any improper business practices with respect to loss
mitigation insurance products.

The Company’s insurance
subsidiaries have also received and have responded to broadly distributed information
requests by state regulators including among others, from Delaware and Georgia.

Dividend History and
Restrictions

In 1995, the Board of Directors of
the Company established a policy of declaring regular quarterly cash dividends and has
paid a regular quarterly dividend in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 1995. The
Company declared and paid its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share for each
quarter of 2005 and $0.10 per share for each quarter of 2004. A committee of the
Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.12 per share, payable on or
before March 24, 2006 to shareholders of record on March 6, 2006.

The declaration and payment of future
dividends, if any, by the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and
will depend upon many factors, including the Company’s earnings, financial condition,
business needs and growth objectives, capital and surplus requirements of its operating
subsidiaries, regulatory restrictions, rating agency considerations and other factors. As
an insurance holding company, the Company is partially dependent on dividends and other
permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. The
payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to
Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re is
subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. See “Regulatory Matters –
Dividends” and Note 14A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

The following is a discussion of the
results of operations and financial condition of the Company. This discussion and analysis
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data”.

RESTRUCTURING

On February 24, 2000, a corporate
restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding company of Holdings,
which remains the holding company for Group’s U.S. operations. Effective January 1,
2005 the principal executive offices of Group were relocated from Barbados to Bermuda.

INDUSTRY CONDITIONS

The worldwide reinsurance and
insurance businesses are highly competitive, yet cyclical by product and market.
Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the Company
underwrites is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength
of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or
S&P, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is
licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other
terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered,
speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written. These factors
operate at the individual market participant level to varying degrees, as applicable to
the specific participant’s circumstances. They also operate in aggregate across the
reinsurance industry more generally, contributing, in combination with background economic
conditions and variations in the reinsurance buying practices of insurance companies (by
participant and in the aggregate), to cyclical movements in reinsurance rates, terms and
conditions and ultimately reinsurance industry aggregate financial results.

The Company competes in the U.S.,
Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global
competitors. The Company’s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance
companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies,
reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international
underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s. Some of these
competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and have established
long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be a
significant competitive advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into
the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance
risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and
insurance capacity and competition.

In 2004 and 2005, market conditions
weakened following hard market conditions that had developed from 2000 through 2003.
Pricing for most property and casualty classes declined modestly. Competition increased
modestly as well, in part due to the relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers
from 2002 through 2004, the attendant buildup of capital by these participants and growing
pressures to effectively redeploy this capital. However, this profitability and capital
buildup varied significantly by market participant, reflecting the fact that the industry
was impacted by significant catastrophe losses in the second half of 2004, generally weak
investment market conditions and ongoing adverse loss development. All of these factors
depressed the industry’s aggregate financial performance and perceptions of
individual insurer’s financial strength during the period.

For the insurance industry, 2005 was
a year of unprecedented catastrophe losses in terms of both frequency and severity, which
negatively impacted the financial results of a broad number of (re)insurance market
participants. The Company believes that the scope and scale of industry losses have helped
to stabilize the weakening that was taking place in many sectors and will lead to
generally improving market conditions during 2006 that are likely to vary by product and
market. For the property catastrophe and retrocession lines, the Company expects


that
demand and pricing will increase the most as companies reassess their risk management
approach and rating agencies raise the required capital levels for many industry
participants. The Company believes that price increases for these two lines will be most
pronounced in peak catastrophe zones, such as the southeastern U.S. For remaining property
lines, there will likely be modest rate increases, while the casualty markets have
generally steadied and are expected to stabilize at adequate pricing levels in 2006 for
both insurance and reinsurance.

The Company notes that it continues
to see opportunities for profitable writings in a variety of classes and lines owing
mainly to the general adequacy of underlying pricing. However, the Company continues to
examine its view of price adequacy for property lines in light of 2005‘s
unprecedented catastrophe experience from both a frequency and severity perspective. This
reexamination is focused on several key factors including the magnitude and character of
catastrophe exposures, the level of required capital to support the Company’s
businesses from both the Company’s and rating agencies’ perspectives and the
actual and potential volatility and variability of results, by product, business class and
business unit, including with respect to the reliability of underlying statistical and
modeling techniques.


FINANCIAL SUMMARY

The Company’s management
monitors and evaluates overall Company performance based upon financial results. The
following table displays a summary of the consolidated net (loss) income, ratios and
shareholders’ equity for the periods indicated:

Overall, the Company was disappointed
with its 2005 results. The Company generated a net loss of $218.7 million in 2005, which
was $713.5 million less than 2004‘s net income of $494.9 million. This $713.5 million
deterioration was principally driven by $1.1 billion of higher pre-tax catastrophe losses
tempered somewhat by improved non-catastrophe prior year reserve development, which
improved by $275.8 million to a total net favorable development of $26.4 million. The
Company incurred $1.5 billion of pre-tax catastrophe losses in 2005 driven extensively by
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. These three devastating events resulted in the worst
catastrophe loss year in history for both the insurance industry and the Company.

Catastrophe risk is a fundamental
risk element to which the Company is exposed. Its risk management framework considers such
exposures carefully. As a consequence of the 2005 catastrophe experience, the


Company
continues to re-examine and adjust its comprehensive framework of risk assessment,
accumulation monitoring and risk mitigation seeking balance between risk versus reward in
the context of changing market conditions.

Meanwhile, the Company is extremely
well positioned to respond to generally improving market conditions in 2006 in the
aftermath of unprecedented catastrophe losses in late 2005. First, the Company’s
non-catastrophe operating fundamentals remain very strong. Second, the Company’s
capital base is as strong as it has ever been having been recently bolstered by proceeds
from secondary offerings. Third, the Company’s broad, diversified global franchise
and low-cost operating platform provide a wide spectrum of business opportunities in a
variety of product classes and markets. Lastly, the discipline with which the Company
approaches its business remains intact causing it to look opportunistically at improving
market conditions while providing its underwriters with the flexibility to decline
business that does not meet its objectives regarding underwriting profitability.

Revenues.

Gross written premiums decreased 12.7% to $4.1 billion in 2005 from $4.7 billion
          in 2004 reflecting the Company’s disciplined response to modest market
          softening in most sectors, particularly earlier in the year. The Company adapted
          its operations to slow its growth and even decrease writings for some classes of
          business and reemphasize its focus on profitability as opposed to volume. The
          classes most affected by these actions were workers’ compensation
          insurance, individual risk (re)insurance, medical stop loss reinsurance, UK
          motor business reinsurance and select U.S. casualty reinsurance classes. As a
          result, the U.S. Insurance segment decreased 20.2% due to declines in its
          predominant workers’ compensation book, while the reinsurance segments
          declined 10.2% in the aggregate.

Net written premiums and net earned
premiums declined 12.3% and 10.4%, respectively, to $4.0 billion in 2005 compared to 2004,
consistent with the decrease in gross written premiums.

Net investment income was $522.8
million in 2005, an increase of 5.4% compared with 2004 reflecting growth in invested
assets, partially offset by lower investment portfolio yields from the Company’s
fixed maturities and lower returns from the Company’s equity investments in limited
partnerships. The Company’s invested asset base at year-end 2005 was $13.0 billion,
up $1.4 billion over prior year mainly driven by $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations
and $758.3 million of common equity offering net proceeds, partially offset by $250.0
million of senior debt repayment during the period. Cash flows, which have been trending
down over the past two years due to increased catastrophe losses and reduced premiums
written, remain strong and are reflective of strong operating fundamentals. The embedded
investment portfolio yields in 2005 were 4.5% pre-tax and 3.9% after-tax, down from 4.7%
and 4.1%, respectively, in 2004, reflective of the Company’s elevated short-term
investment holdings, which had the effect of reducing the Company’s asset duration
and lessening the fixed income portfolio susceptibility to rising interest rates in the
future.

Net realized capital gains were $90.3
million in 2005 driven by gains on the sale of the Company’s interest only strips
investment portfolio and other portfolio management activities in response to interest
rate and credit market movements. Other expenses increased by $19.2 million in 2005 driven
primarily by foreign exchange losses.

Expenses.

Incurred losses and LAE for 2005 were $3.7 billion, an increase of $0.4
          billion over 2004, principally related to $1.1 billion higher level of
          catastrophe losses, partially offset by a $0.4 billion decrease in
          non-catastrophe prior period reserve adjustments and lower earned premiums. The
          Company’s non-catastrophe incurred losses were down 10.5% in 2005, which is
          broadly in line with the 10.4% decline in net earned premiums, reflective of
          generally stable business trends. The Company’s 2005 incurred losses
          benefited from $26.4 million of favorable prior period reserve adjustments in
          2005 comprised of $226.3 million of favorable reserve development on
          non-catastrophe, non-A&E reserves principally related to property business
          classes, partially offset by catastrophe reserve development of $118.5 million,
          mostly from 2004 Florida hurricane


events and A&E development of $81.4
          million, mostly related to settlement activity with respect to asbestos
          exposures.

Commission, brokerage and tax
expenses for 2005 were $914.8 million, a decrease of $60.3 million compared to 2004,
principally reflecting decreases in premium volume and changes in business mix. However,
the Company’s commission expense ratio increased by 1.1 points primarily due to an
increase in contingent commissions and premium based taxes. Other underwriting expenses
for 2005 were $123.5 million, a $16.3 million increase principally reflective of the
continued build-out of the U.S. Insurance platform.

The Company generated an income tax
benefit of $62.3 million in 2005 equating to an effective tax rate of 22.2% applied to its
pre-tax loss of $280.9 million for the year. This elevated effective tax rate reflected
the impact of the year’s catastrophe losses on U.S. operations, producing a
significant tax loss, partly mitigated by continued profitable operations in the United
Kingdom.

The Company generated a net loss of
$218.7 million in 2005 compared to net income of $494.8 million in 2004. This $713.5
million deterioration in 2005 was principally driven by $1.1 billion of higher catastrophe
losses tempered somewhat by improved non-catastrophe prior year reserve development of
$0.4 billion.

The Company’s shareholders’
equity increased by $0.4 billion to $4.1 billion at year-end 2005 driven by $758.7 million
of equity offering proceeds, partially offset by the $218.7 million net loss for the
period and a $77.8 million reduction in net unrealized appreciation on investments,
principally related to fixed-income securities affected by modestly rising interest rates.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property
and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance
brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance
operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent
relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting
operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and
worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation
writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re’s branches in Canada and
Singapore, in addition to foreign business written through Everest Re’s Miami and New
Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide
property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and
directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and property and casualty
reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, with respect to
pricing, risk management, monitoring aggregate exposures to catastrophic events, capital,
investments and support operations. Management generally monitors and evaluates the
financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results.
Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and
brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in
particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which,
respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting
expenses by earned premium. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance but such
reinsurance generally does not impact segment results, as business is generally reported
within the segment in which the business was first produced. For selected financial
information regarding these segments, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re
sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re. Business for this branch was previously
included in the International segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to
the


sale and in accordance with FAS 131, the Company restated the International and
Bermuda segments for the year ended December 31, 2003 to conform to December 31, 2005 and
2004 segment reporting.

In 2003, Everest National, another
subsidiary of the Company, opened a regional office in California to better serve its
western U.S. insurance business. The business produced through this additional office is
included in the U.S. Insurance operation.

The following tables present the

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005
COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

Premiums Written.

Gross
written premiums decreased 12.7% to $4,108.6 million in 2005 from $4,704.1 million in 2004
reflecting a disciplined underwriting response to modest reinsurance market softening that
affected all segments, resulting in an overall premium decline. Premiums declined 35.4%
($172.4 million) in the Specialty Underwriting operation, primarily due to a $145.4
million decrease in A&H business and a $47.9 million decrease in surety business,
partially offset by a $20.9 million increase in marine and aviation business. The U.S.
Insurance operation decreased 20.2% ($235.3 million), principally as a result of a $242.6
million decrease in workers’ compensation, resulting primarily from changes in the
California workers’ compensation market. The Bermuda operation decreased 13.0%
($114.7 million) reflecting declines in individual risk underwritten insurance and
reinsurance in Bermuda and in motor business reinsurance in the U.K. The U.S.


Reinsurance
operation decreased 6.2% ($92.0 million), principally relating to a $173.1 million
decrease in treaty casualty business and a $29.3 million decrease in facultative business,
partially offset by a $118.9 million increase in treaty property business. The
International operation increased 2.8% ($18.9 million), resulting primarily from a $75.0
million increase in Asian business, partially offset by a $43.6 million decrease in
international business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices, representing
primarily Latin American business and an $11.3 million decrease in Canadian business.

Ceded premiums decreased to $136.5
million in 2005 from $172.6 million in 2004, principally resulting from the decrease in
gross premiums in the U.S. Insurance operations. Ceded premiums generally relate to
specific reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and fluctuate based upon
the level of premiums written in the individual reinsured programs.

Net written premiums decreased by
12.3% to $3,972.0 million in 2005 from $4,531.5 million in 2004, consistent with the
decrease in gross written premiums, combined with the decrease in ceded premiums.

Premium
Revenues.

Net premiums earned declined by 10.4% to $3,963.1 million in 2005
from $4,425.1 million in 2004. Contributing to this decrease was a 34.4% ($157.8 million)
decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation, a 15.6% ($139.9 million) decrease in the
Bermuda operation, a 12.2% ($114.6 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance operation and a
5.3% ($77.4 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, partially offset by a
4.2% ($27.7 million) increase in the International operation. Partially tempering the
decline in net premiums earned in 2005 were $81.8 million of reinstatement premiums of
which $64.4 million were due to Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Generally, catastrophe
reinsurance provides coverage for one event; however, when limits are exhausted, some
contractual arrangements provide for the availability of additional coverage upon the
payment of additional premium. This additional premium is referred to as reinstatement
premium. There were no such reinstatement premiums for 2004. All of these changes reflect
period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix, together with normal
variability in earnings patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company
shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets,
but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in
coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted with
coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring contracts. As
premium reporting, earnings, loss and commission characteristics derive from the
provisions of individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual contracts,
arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting, can and does introduce
appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items. Changes in
estimates related to the reporting patterns of ceding companies also affect premiums
earned.

Expenses

Incurred Losses and LAE.

Incurred loss and LAE increased by 13.2% to $3,724.3 million in 2005 from $3,291.1
million in 2004. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was principally attributable to
the increase in estimated losses due to property catastrophes, partially offset by
favorable non-catastrophe prior period reserve development and a lower level of earned
premiums. Incurred losses and LAE in 2005 reflected ceded losses and LAE of $95.2 million
compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2004 of $141.0 million. The decrease in ceded losses
was primarily the result of fluctuations in losses ceded under the specific reinsurance
coverages purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and less ceded premium period over
period.

The Company’s loss ratio, which
is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net premiums earned, increased by
19.6 percentage points to 94.0% in 2005 from 74.4% in 2004. This 19.6 point year over year
loss ratio deterioration was primarily the result of a 29.5 point increase due to
catastrophe losses, partially offset by a 10.2 point improvement in non-catastrophe prior
year reserve development.


The following table shows the loss
ratios for each of the Company’s operating segments for 2005 and 2004. The loss
ratios for all operations were impacted by the factors noted above.

The segment components of the
increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2005 from 2004 were a 37.1% ($155.6 million)
increase in the International operation, a 26.6% ($311.0 million) increase in the U.S.
Reinsurance operation, a 10.6% ($78.7 million) increase in the Bermuda operation,
partially offset by a 19.4% ($128.0 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance operation and
a 5.3% ($15.9 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. These changes
reflect variability in premiums earned and changes in the loss expectation assumptions for
business written, as well as the net prior period reserve development and catastrophe
losses discussed above. Incurred losses and LAE for each operation were also impacted by
changes in the pricing of the underlying business, as well as variability relating to
changes in the mix of business by class and type.

Incurred losses and LAE include
catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable
and unfavorable development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance. Individual
catastrophe losses are reported net of specific reinsurance, but before recoveries under
corporate level reinsurance and potential incurred but not reported (“IBNR”)
loss reserve offsets. The Company defines a catastrophe as a property event with expected
reported losses of at least $5.0 million before corporate level reinsurance and taxes.
Effective for the third quarter 2005, industrial risk losses have been excluded from
catastrophe losses with prior periods adjusted for comparison purposes. Catastrophe
losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $1,485.7 million in 2005, related
principally to aggregate estimated losses driven by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma
with catastrophe losses of $765.9 million, $151.0 million and $381.6 million,
respectively, but also reflected catastrophe losses related to hurricanes Emily ($19.8
million) and Dennis ($7.0 million), floods in India ($13.2 million), Calgary ($9.6
million) and Europe ($6.2 million) and storms in Ontario ($12.9 million). The 2005 results
also reflect net unfavorable reserve development on 2004 and prior catastrophes of $118.5
million. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $390.0 million in
2004, related principally to aggregate estimated losses of $428.8 million from Hurricanes
Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, Edmonton hailstorms and the Asian
tsunami, which were partially offset by $33.4 million of reserve reductions related to the
2001 World Trade Center losses.

period reserve adjustments for each of the Company’s operating segments for 2005 and
2004.

Net favorable prior period reserve
adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $26.4 million compared to net
unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments of $249.4 million in 2004. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the favorable reserve adjustments included net favorable non-A&E,
non-catastrophe reserve adjustments of $226.3 million related primarily to property
business classes, partially offset by net unfavorable prior period catastrophe adjustments
of $118.5 million related primarily to the 2004 hurricanes and net unfavorable A&E
adjustments of $81.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the unfavorable prior
period reserve adjustments included net unfavorable A&E adjustments of $159.4 million
and net unfavorable non-A&E, non-catastrophe adjustments of approximately $128.7
million relating primarily to casualty reinsurance. Partially offsetting the 2004
unfavorable development was $38.7 million of favorable catastrophe development principally
related to the reduction of reserves for the World Trade Center events. It is important to
note that non-A&E accident year reserve development arises from the re-evaluation of
accident year results and that such re-evaluations may also impact premiums and
commissions attributed by accident year, generally mitigating, in part, the impact of loss
development and that such impacts are recorded as part of the overall reserve evaluation
process.

The U.S. Reinsurance segment
accounted for $20.7 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the
year ended December 31, 2005, which included $72.5 million of unfavorable catastrophe
prior period reserve adjustments, partially offset by favorable net non-A&E,
non-catastrophe reserve adjustments of $63.3 million. Net unfavorable prior period reserve
adjustments were $77.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, which included $102.2
million of unfavorable non-A&E, non-catastrophe prior period reserve adjustments,
partially offset by $34.8 million of favorable development primarily due to reserve
reduction related to catastrophe losses from the 2001 World Trade Center losses. Asbestos
exposures accounted for $11.5 million and $10.3 million of unfavorable reserve adjustments
for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the late 1990s and
early 2000s, there had been a proliferation of claims related to bankruptcies and other
financial management improprieties. This increased number of claims, combined with larger
claims, has significantly increased incurred losses on the professional liability
policies. In the general casualty area, the Company continues to experience losses greater
than historical trends for accident years 1998 through 2001. These losses are being driven
by adverse trends in litigation and economic variability.

The U.S. Insurance segment reflected
$19.5 million of net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended
December 31, 2005 and $43.3 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments
for the year ended December 31, 2004. The 2005 favorable prior period reserve adjustments
related principally to California workers’ compensation for the 2004 accident year as
the results of benefit reform have become clearer and the 2004 unfavorable prior period
reserve adjustments related principally to the casualty classes related to accident years
2000 through 2002, where the Company strengthened its reserves for California
workers’ compensation insurance. While management believes the cumulative results
through 2005 remain


quite positive, there was some deterioration in claim frequency and
severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002.

The Specialty Underwriting segment
had $16.1 million of net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended
December 31, 2005 and $5.1 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for
the year ended December 31, 2004. In 2005, net favorable prior period reserve adjustments
reflected $33.0 million of non-A&E, non-catastrophe favorable development on the
marine, aviation, surety and A&H classes of business, partially offset by unfavorable
catastrophe development of $16.9 million. In 2004, net unfavorable prior period reserve
adjustments related to the surety and A&H classes of business, partially offset by
favorable development in the marine and aviation business lines.

The International segment had $49.2
million of favorable net prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31,
2005 and $15.1 million of net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year
ended December 31, 2004. The favorable development in 2005 related primarily to favorable
non-asbestos, non-catastrophe reserve development on the Canadian, Asian, and
international business of $66.1 million, partially offset by unfavorable property
catastrophe loss development of $16.9 million on the same business. The favorable
development in 2004 related primarily to 2003 Canadian property catastrophe, international
and Asian business.

The Bermuda segment reflected $37.7
million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December
31, 2005 and $138.4 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the
year ended December 31, 2004. The development in the year ended December 31, 2005 was
primarily the result of $69.9 million of unfavorable A&E prior period reserve
development and $12.2 million unfavorable catastrophe development, partially offset by
$44.4 million favorable non-A&E, non-catastrophe prior period reserve adjustments
primarily from the UK branch produced business. The development in the year ended December
31, 2004 was primarily the result of $149.1 million of A&E reserve development. All of
the development related to asbestos exposures that were assumed through the September 19,
2000 loss portfolio transfer from Mt. McKinley.

Aggregate reserve development related
to A&E exposures was $81.4 million and $159.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written
by the Company prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley
acquisition in September 2000. The reserve strengthening on business written by the
Company, net of reinsurance, was $11.5 million and the net strengthening on the acquired
Mt. McKinley business was $69.9 million in 2005. Substantially all of the Company’s
A&E exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods
prior to 1986. Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses,
management is unable to establish a meaningful range for these obligations.

In all cases, the prior period
reserve development, sometimes referred to as reserve strengthening, reflects
management’s judgment as to the implications of losses and claim information reported
during the period on the Company’s reserve balances.

Underwriting Expenses.

The
Company’s expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net
premiums earned, was 26.2% in 2005 compared to 24.4% in 2004.


The following table shows the expense
ratios for each of the Company’s operating segments for 2005 and 2004.

Segment underwriting expenses
decreased by 4.7% to $1,024.9 million in 2005 from $1,075.8 million in 2004. Commission,
brokerage, taxes and fees decreased by $60.3 million, principally reflecting decreases in
premium volume and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses
increased by $9.4 million as the Company continued to expand operations. Contributing to
the segment underwriting expense decreases were a 36.6% ($49.8 million) decrease in the
Specialty Underwriting operation, a 3.8% ($14.9 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance
operation and a 0.7% ($1.3 million) decrease in the Bermuda operation, partially offset by
a 4.5% ($7.9 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 4.2% ($7.2 million)
increase in the International operation. The changes for each operation’s expenses
principally resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium
volume and business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of
specific reinsurance, as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business.

The Company’s combined ratio,
which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, increased by 21.4 percentage points to
120.2% in 2005 as compared to 98.8% in 2004, with the increase principally resulting from
elevated catastrophe losses, partially offset by improved prior year development.

The following table shows the
combined ratios for each of the Company’s operating segments in 2005 and 2004. The
combined ratios for all operations were impacted by the loss and expense ratio variability
noted above.

Investment Results.

Net
investment income increased 5.4% to $522.8 million in 2005 from $495.9 million in 2004
reflecting growth in invested assets tempered by lower investment yields and lower returns
from limited partnership investments. Investable assets increased by $1.4 billion to $13.0
billion in 2005, principally reflecting the effects of investing $1,065.7 million cash
flow from operations during the year and $758.3 million net proceeds from issuance of
common shares, partially offset by $250.0 million in debt repayment. The lower investment
yield reflects the Company’s elevated short-term investments following its common
share capital raising in the fourth quarter, which also reduced the investment income
portfolio duration. Investment income for the limited partnerships for the year ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $12.0 million and $42.0 million, respectively.

The Company, because of its historical
income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of income yield
and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a measure of
performance than its overall income yield. However, in 2005, with changes the Company
perceived in overall investment market conditions, the Company continued to reweight its
view of total return and added $440.0 million in 2005 of equity securities into the
overall investment portfolio. The Company also added $125.5 million of other invested
assets, principally limited partnerships. The following table provides a comparison of the
Company’s total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry
benchmarks for 2005 and 2004.

The Company’s net realized
capital gains were $90.3 million in 2005, which reflected realized capital gains on the
Company’s investments of $106.2 million, including $41.3 million on the sale of
interest only strips investments, partially offset by $15.9 million of realized capital
losses, which included $7.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest
only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with EITF
99-20. Net realized capital gains were $89.6 million in 2004, which reflected realized
capital gains on the Company’s investments of $164.3 million, including $118.2
million on the sale of interest only strip investments, partially offset by $74.7 million
of realized capital losses, which included $65.0 million related to the write-downs in the
value of interest only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in
accordance with EITF 99-20.

The Company has outstanding seven
specialized equity put options in its product portfolio at December 31, 2005. These
products meet the definition of a derivative under Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS
133”). Net derivative expense from these derivative transactions was $2.6 million and
$2.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, reflecting changes in fair value for the
specialized equity put options. See also Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Other Expenses.

Other
expense in 2005 was $18.5 million compared to other income of $0.7 million in 2004. The
change in net other expense for 2005 from net other income in 2004 was primarily due to
variability in the impact of foreign exchange and share option expense under Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(“FAS 123”).

Corporate underwriting expenses not
allocated to segments were $13.5 million for 2005 as compared to $6.5 million for 2004 as
the Company expanded its infrastructure to support operations.


Interest expense and fees in 2005
were $73.4 million compared to $75.5 million in 2004. Interest expense and fees in 2005
included $35.5 million relating to the senior notes, $37.4 million relating to the junior
subordinated debt securities and $0.4 million relating to the credit line under the
Company’s revolving credit facilities. Interest expense and fees in 2004 included
$42.0 million relating to the senior notes, $32.4 million relating to the junior
subordinated debt securities and $1.2 million relating to borrowings under the
Company’s revolving credit facilities. The lower interest expense on the senior notes
was due to the retirement of the 8.5% senior notes due March 15, 2005, partially offset by
the issuance of new 5.4 % senior notes on October 12, 2004.

Income Taxes.

The Company’s income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates
and corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with
the impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations generally reflect changes in
the relative levels of pre-tax income between jurisdictions with different tax rates, and
specifically for 2005, also reflected the significant increase in incurred losses relating
to catastrophes resulting, ultimately, in a pre-tax loss for the year. The Company
recognized income tax benefits of $62.3 million in 2005 compared to income tax expense of
$64.9 million in 2004

.

The 2004 tax expense was impacted by various issues,
including the transfer of the Company’s UK branch to Bermuda Re, giving rise to a net
tax expense.

Net (Loss)
Income.

Net loss was $218.7 million in 2005 compared to net income of
$494.9 million in 2004, with the change primarily reflecting reduced underwriting
profitability due to catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior period
reserve development, related tax benefits and improved investment income.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2004 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003

Premiums Written.

Gross
written premiums increased 2.8% to $4,704.1 million in 2004 from $4,573.8 million in 2003,
as the Company took advantage of selected growth opportunities, while continuing to
maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. Premium growth areas included a 32.0%
($166.9 million) increase in the International operations, primarily due to a $97.7
million increase in international business written through the Miami and New Jersey
offices, representing primarily Latin American business, and a $67.2 million increase in
Asian business. The Bermuda operation grew 21.3% ($155.2 million) reflecting an emphasis
on traditional business classes in Bermuda and the UK. The U.S. Insurance operation grew
9.2% ($98.3 million), principally as a result of a $193.8 million increase in program
business other than workers’ compensation, partially offset by a $95.5 million
decrease in workers’ compensation business. The Specialty Underwriting operation
decreased 3.1% ($15.8 million), resulting primarily from a $70.4 million decrease in
A&H business, partially offset by an increase in surety business of $29.6 million and
an increase in marine and aviation business of $25.0 million. The U.S. Reinsurance
operation decreased 15.6% ($274.1 million), principally relating to an $142.5 million
decrease in treaty casualty business, a $74.9 million decrease in facultative business, a
$32.6 million decrease in treaty property business and a $19.8 million decrease in treaty
non-property business.

Ceded premiums decreased to $172.6
million in 2004 from $258.4 million in 2003, principally resulting from the inclusion in
2003 of $49.6 million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the 2000
accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the Company’s corporate
retrocessional programs, compared with no such adjustment premiums in 2004. Aside from the
corporate retrocessional programs, ceded premiums generally relate to specific reinsurance
purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and fluctuate based upon the level of premiums
written in the applicable programs.

Net written premiums increased by
5.0% to $4,531.5 million in 2004 from $4,315.4 million in 2003, reflecting the increase in
gross written premiums, combined with the decrease in ceded premiums.

Premium
Revenues.

Net premiums earned increased by 18.4% to $4,425.1 million in
2004 from $3,737.9 million in 2003. Contributing to this increase was a 60.6% ($339.1
million) increase in the Bermuda operation, a 42.0% ($194.1 million) increase in the
International operation, a 13.8% ($114.0 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation
and a 3.5% ($49.7 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, partially offset by
a


2.1% ($9.6 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. All of these
changes reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix,
together with normal variability in earnings patterns. Business mix changes occur not only
as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels
and markets, but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with
changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted
with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring
contracts. As premium reporting, earnings, loss and commission characteristics derive from
the provisions of individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual contracts,
arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting, can and does introduce
appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items. Changes in
estimates related to the reporting patterns of companies also affect premiums earned.

Expenses

Incurred Losses and LAE.

Incurred loss and LAE increased by 26.6% to $3,291.1 million in 2004 from $2,600.2
million in 2003. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was principally attributable to
the provision for estimated catastrophe losses from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and
Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, the Asian tsunami and reserve adjustments for prior period
losses, together with the mitigating effects of the increase in net premiums earned and
the impact of favorable changes in the Company’s underlying business mix and
aggregate rates, terms and conditions. Incurred losses and LAE in 2004 reflected ceded
losses and LAE of $141.0 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2003 of $278.4
million. The decrease in ceded losses is primarily the result of the absence in 2004 of
cessions under the corporate level aggregate reinsurance covers. The ceded losses and LAE
in 2003 included $85.0 million of losses ceded under the 2000 accident year aggregate
excess of loss component of the Company’s corporate retrocessional program and $81.1
million under the LM/Mt. McKinley reinsurance agreement.

The Company’s loss ratio, which
is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net premiums earned, increased by 4.8
percentage points to 74.4% in 2004 from 69.6% in 2003, reflecting the impact of the
changes in premiums earned and incurred losses and LAE discussed above, as well as
favorable changes in the underlying business mix and aggregate rates, terms and
conditions.

The following table shows the loss
ratios for each of the Company’s operating segments for 2004 and 2003. The loss
ratios for all operations were impacted by the factors noted above.

The segment components of the
increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2004 from 2003 were a 99.4% ($370.3 million)
increase in the Bermuda operation, a 56.6% ($151.4 million) increase in the International
operation, a 10.3% ($109.5 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, an 8.8%
($53.2 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 2.2% ($6.6 million)
increase in the Specialty Underwriting operation. These changes reflect variability in
premiums earned and changes in the loss expectation assumptions for business written, as
well as the net prior period reserve development and catastrophe losses discussed above.
Incurred losses and LAE for each operation were also impacted by generally improved
pricing of the underlying business, as well as variability relating to changes in the mix
of business by class and type, which in general reflected a more favorable mix.

Incurred losses and LAE include
catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable
and unfavorable development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance. Individual
catastrophe losses are reported net of specific reinsurance, but before recoveries under
corporate level reinsurance and potential IBNR reserve offsets. The Company defines a
catastrophe as a property event with expected reported losses of at least $5.0 million
before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. Effective in 2005, industrial risk losses
were excluded from catastrophe losses. As such, prior periods were adjusted for comparison
reasons. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $390.0 million in
2004, relating principally to aggregate estimated losses of $428.8 million from Hurricanes
Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, Edmonton hailstorms and the Asian
tsunami, which were partially offset by $33.4 million of reserve reductions related to the
2001 World Trade Center losses. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions,
were $35.0 million in 2003, relating principally to the May 2003 tornado and hailstorm
events and Hurricanes Fabian and Isabel.

Net unfavorable prior period reserve
adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $249.4 million compared to $196.8
million in 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the unfavorable reserve adjustments
included net unfavorable A&E adjustments of $159.4 million and net unfavorable
non-A&E, non-catastrophe adjustments of approximately $128.7 million relating
primarily to casualty reinsurance and workers’ compensation insurance. Partially
offsetting the unfavorable development was favorable catastrophe development of $38.7
million principally related to the reduction of reserves for the World Trade Center
events. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net unfavorable prior period reserve
adjustments for A&E exposures were $50.2 million and net unfavorable non-A&E
adjustments were $146.6 million, which were net of a cession of $85 million under the 2000
accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company’s corporate


retrocessional program. It is important to note that unfavorable non-A&E accident year
reserve development arises from the re-evaluation of accident year results and that such
re-evaluations also impact premiums and commissions attributed by accident year, generally
mitigating, in part, the impact of loss development and that such impacts are recorded as
part of the overall reserve evaluation process.

The U.S. Reinsurance segment
accounted for $77.7 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the
year ended December 31, 2004, which included $34.8 million of favorable development due to
the reserve reduction principally related to the catastrophe losses from the World Trade
Center events, as compared to net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments of $150.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Asbestos exposures accounted for $10.3
million and $16.8 million of unfavorable reserve adjustments for the years ended December
31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, with the remainder principally attributable to
professional liability and casualty business classes. During the late 1990s and early
2000s, there had been a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other
financial management improprieties. This increased number of claims, combined with larger
claims, has significantly increased incurred losses on the professional liability
policies. In the general casualty area, the Company continues to experience losses greater
than historical trends for accident years 1998 through 2001. These losses are being driven
by adverse trends in litigation and economic variability. In both the professional
liability and general casualty reinsurance areas, the Company relies upon loss reports
from ceding companies. Although the Company may record reserves at higher levels than
those reported by ceding companies, actual reported results have exceeded the initial loss
indications.

The U.S. Insurance segment reflected
$43.3 million and $58.7 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The unfavorable prior period
reserve adjustments were principally due to accident years 2000 through 2002, where the
Company strengthened its reserves for California workers’ compensation insurance.
This was a relatively new book of business and was written in a challenging political and
economic environment. While management believes the cumulative results through 2004 remain
quite positive, there has been some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related
to accident years 2001 and 2002.

The Specialty Underwriting segment
had $5.1 million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended
December 31, 2004, principally related to net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments
in the surety and A&H business lines, partially offset by favorable development from
marine and aviation. The net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended
December 31, 2003 were $23.9 million, primarily related to A&H business.

The International segment had $15.1
million of favorable net prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31,
2004 and net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments of $9.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The favorable development in 2004 related primarily to 2003
Canadian property catastrophe, international and Asian business. The prior period reserve
development for 2003 related primarily to general casualty business written in the U.S.
and Canada on both a quota share and excess basis for accident years 1996 through 2002.

The Bermuda segment reflected $138.4
million of net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December
31, 2004 and $1.8 million of net unfavorable prior reserve adjustments for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The development in the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the
result of $149.1 million of A&E reserve development. For the year ended December 31,
2003, reserve adjustments included $33.4 million unfavorable prior period reserve
adjustments related to A&E exposures, partially offset by $31.6 million favorable
non-A&E adjustments. All of the development related to asbestos exposures were assumed
through the September 19, 2000 loss portfolio transfer from Mt. McKinley.


Aggregate reserve development related
to A&E exposures was $159.4 million and $50.2 million for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written
by the Company prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley
acquisition in September 2000. The reserve strengthening on business written by the
Company, net of reinsurance, was $10.3 million and the net strengthening on the acquired
business was $149.1 million in 2004. Substantially all of the Company’s A&E
exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods prior to
1986. Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management is
unable to establish a meaningful range for these obligations.

In all cases, the prior period
reserve development, sometimes referred to as reserve strengthening, reflects
management’s judgment as to the implications of losses and claim information reported
during the period on the Company’s reserve balances.

Underwriting Expenses.

The
Company’s expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net
premiums earned, was 24.4% in 2004 compared to 25.6% in 2003.

The following table shows the expense
ratios for each of the Company’s operating segments for 2004 and 2003.

Segment underwriting expenses
increased by 12.9% to $1,075.8 million in 2004 from $952.6 million in 2003. Commission,
brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $111.2 million, principally reflecting increases in
premium volume and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses
increased by $11.9 million as the Company continues to expand operations to support its
increased business volume. Contributing to the segment underwriting expense increases were
a 47.5% ($62.8 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, a 40.4% ($49.6 million)
increase in the International operation and a 6.6% ($24.7 million) increase in the U.S.
Reinsurance operation, which were partially offset by a 5.5% ($10.1 million) decrease in
the U.S. Insurance operation and a 2.7% ($3.7 million) decrease in the Specialty
Underwriting operation. The changes for each operation’s expenses principally
resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium volume and
business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of specific
reinsurance, as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business.

The Company’s combined ratio,
which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, increased by 3.6 percentage points to
98.8% in 2004 compared to 95.2% in 2003.

          million in 2003, principally reflecting the effects of investing $1,487.6
          million of cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31,
          2004, as well as $320.0 million of net proceeds from the issuance of junior
          subordinated debt securities in March 2004 and $250.0 million of net proceeds
          from the issuance of senior notes in October 2004. The increase also reflected
          $32.7 million representing an atypical increase in the carrying value of a
          limited partnership investment.

The Company, because of its historical
income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of income yield
and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a measure of
performance than its overall income yield. However, in 2004, with changes the Company
perceived in overall investment market conditions, the Company continued to reweight its
view of total return and added $496.5 million of equity securities in 2004 into the
overall investment portfolio. The following table provides a comparison of the
Company’s total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry
benchmarks for 2004 and 2003.

The Company’s net realized
capital gains were $89.6 million in 2004, which reflected realized capital gains on the
Company’s investments of $164.3 million, including $118.2 million on the sale of
interest only strip investments, partially offset by $74.7 million of realized capital
losses, which included $65.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest
only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with EITF
99-20, prior to liquidation of the interest only strips portfolio during the second
quarter of 2004. Net realized capital losses of $38.0 million in 2003 reflected realized
capital losses on the Company’s investments of $88.7 million, which included $25.7
million relating to write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be impaired on an
other than temporary basis and $46.2 million related to the impairment on interest only
strips, partially offset by $50.7 million of realized capital gains, which included $16.8
million of realized capital gains on sales of the interest only strips.

The Company had one credit default
swap, which it no longer writes, and five specialized equity put options in its product
portfolio. These products meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. Net
derivative expense from these derivative transactions in 2004 was $2.7 million and net
derivative income from these derivative transactions in 2003 was $5.9 million, with both
periods principally reflecting changes in fair value for the specialized equity put
options. See also Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Other Expenses.

Other income
in 2004 was $0.7 million compared to other expense of $1.0 million in 2003. The decrease
in net expense for 2004 was primarily due to variability in the impact of foreign
exchange, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses.

Corporate underwriting expenses not
allocated to segments increased to $6.5 million for 2004 compared with $6.0 million for
2003 as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support increased business volume.

Interest expense in 2004 was $75.5
million compared to $57.3 million in 2003. Interest expense in 2004 included $42.0 million
related to the senior notes, $32.4 million related to the junior subordinated debt
securities and $1.2 million related to borrowings under the Company’s revolving
credit facility. Interest expense in 2003 reflected $38.9 million related to the issuance
of the senior notes, $17.0 million related to the junior subordinated debt securities and
$1.4 million related to borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The
increase in interest expense was due to the additional issuance of $320 million of junior
subordinated debt securities in March 2004 and the issuance of $250 million of senior
notes in October 2004.

Income Taxes.

The Company’s income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates
and corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with
the impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations between years generally
reflect changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income between jurisdictions with
different tax rates. Additionally, in conjunction with the transfer of the Company’s
UK Branch to Bermuda Re, there were various tax issues giving rise to net tax expenses.
The Company recognized income tax expense of $64.9 million in 2004 compared to $65.2
million in 2003

.

Net Income.

Net
income was $494.9 million in 2004 compared to net income of $426.0 million in 2003, which
reflected improved investment income and realized capital gains, partially offset by
reduced underwriting profitability due to catastrophe losses.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

The following is a summary of the
critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that (1) require management
to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the
consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions.

LOSS AND LAE RESERVES.

The
Company’s most critical accounting policy is the determination of its loss and LAE
reserves. The Company maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability for
losses and LAE with respect to reported and unreported claims relating to both its
insurance and reinsurance businesses. Because reserves are estimates of ultimate losses
and LAE, management, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques, monitors
reserve adequacy over time, evaluating new information as it becomes known and adjusting
reserves as necessary. Management considers many factors when setting reserves, including:
(1) the Company’s exposure base, generally its premiums earned; (2) its expected loss
ratios on current year writings as determined through extensive interaction between its
underwriters and actuaries by product and class categories; (3) internal actuarial
methodologies which analyze the Company’s loss reporting and payment experience with
similar cases, information from ceding companies and historical trends, such as reserving
patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and
liability; (5) economic conditions; and (6) the uncertainties discussed below regarding
reserve requirements for A&E claims. Based on these considerations, management
believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company’s insurance and
reinsurance loss and LAE reserves. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate,
perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the
change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The Company acknowledges that there
is more uncertainty in establishing loss reserves on assumed business as compared to
direct business. At December 31, 2005 the Company had direct business reserves of $2,059.1


million and assumed business loss reserves of $7,067.6 million, of which $255.5 million
and $313.4 million, respectively, were loss reserves on asbestos business.

Reserving for assumed reinsurance
requires evaluating loss information received from ceding companies. Depending on the type
of contract and the contractual reporting requirements, ceding companies report losses to
the Company in many forms. Generally, proportional/quota share contracts require the
submission of a monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss settlement
activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company.
This information is recorded into the Company’s records. For certain proportional
contracts, there is also an individual loss reporting clause, which requires a detailed
loss report on claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular
type of loss. Excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss
reporting with precautionary notices generally sent when losses reach a significant
percentage of the attachment point of the contract. All individual loss reports and
supporting claim information are managed by the Company’s experienced claims staff.
Based on the evaluation of the claim, the Company may choose to establish additional case
reserves greater than those reported by the ceding company. The Underwriting, Claim,
Reinsurance Accounting and Internal Audit departments of the Company perform various
reviews of the ceding carriers, particularly larger ceding carriers, to ensure that
underwriting and claims procedures meet required standards. The claim information received
from the ceding companies is compiled into loss development triangles. Accepted actuarial
methodologies, supplemented by judgment where appropriate, are then used to develop the
appropriate IBNR for the Company. Included in the determination of IBNR, is a factor for
reporting lags of the ceded carriers. Each quarter, the Company compares its actual
reported losses for the quarter and cumulatively since the most recently completed reserve
study to the expected reported losses for the respective period, which may result in
additional reserving actions. This is done by aggregate class and/or type of business.
This information is used as a tool in the judgmental process by which management assesses
the overall adequacy of loss and LAE reserves.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
EXPOSURES.

The Company continues to receive claims under expired contracts, both
insurance and reinsurance, asserting alleged injuries and/or damages relating to or
resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos. The
Company’s environmental claims typically involve potential liability for (a) the
mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property
damages caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water. The
Company’s asbestos claims typically involve potential liability for bodily injury
from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products
containing asbestos.

The Company’s reserves include
an estimate of the Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims. This estimate is
made based on judgmental assessment of the underlying exposures as the result of: (1) long
and variable reporting delays, both from insureds to insurance companies and from ceding
companies to reinsurers; (2) historical data, which is more limited and variable on
A&E losses than historical information on other types of casualty claims; and (3)
unique aspects of A&E exposures for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using
traditional reserving techniques. There are significant uncertainties in estimating the
amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties
are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily
injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or
environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or
liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and
judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental
claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions
concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g)
uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or
environmental exposure.

With respect to asbestos claims in
particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound
the difficulty in estimating the Company’s liability. These developments include: (a)
continued growth in the number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive
plaintiff bar and including claims against defendants who may only have a
“peripheral” connection to asbestos; (b) a disproportionate


percentage of claims
filed by individuals with no functional impairment, which should have little to no
financial value but that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and
settlements; (c) the growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy filings by
companies as a result of asbestos claims (including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in
which companies attempt to resolve their asbestos liabilities in a manner that is
prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers from participating in the negotiation of
asbestos related bankruptcy reorganization plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a
small number of states that favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims that
might impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product
liability portion; (f) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst
procedural abuses; (g) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants,
especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some states to
address asbestos litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or the U.S.
Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation.

Management believes that these
uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for A&E, and particularly
asbestos losses, significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than
reserves for other types of losses. Given these uncertainties, management believes that no
meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established. The Company establishes
reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law
reflect an exposure for the Company or its ceding companies. The Company’s A&E
liabilities stem from Mt. McKinley’s direct insurance business and Everest Re’s
assumed reinsurance business.

In connection with the acquisition of
Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, LM provided reinsurance to
Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the first $200.0 million of any adverse
development of Mt. McKinley’s reserves as of September 19, 2000 and The Prudential
guaranteed LM’s obligations to Mt. McKinley. Cessions under this reinsurance
agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at December 31, 2003.

Due to the uncertainties discussed
above, the ultimate losses attributable to A&E, and particularly asbestos, may be
subject to more variability than are non-A&E reserves and such variation could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
and/or cash flows. See also Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

With respect to Mt. McKinley, where
the Company has a direct relationship with policyholders, the Company’s aggressive
litigation posture and the uncertainties inherent in the asbestos coverage and bankruptcy
litigation have provided an opportunity to actively engage in settlement negotiations with
a number of those policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities.
Those discussions are oriented towards achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that
limit Mt. McKinley’s liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. In 2004 and
2005, the Company concluded such settlements or reached agreement in principle with 13 of
its high profile policyholders. The Company currently has identified 10 policyholders
based on their past claim activity and/or potential future liabilities as “High
Profile Policyholders” and its settlement efforts are generally directed at such
policyholders, in part because their exposures have developed to the point where both the
policyholder and the Company have sufficient information to be motivated to settle. The
Company believes that this active approach will ultimately result in a more cost-effective
liquidation of Mt. McKinley’s liabilities than a passive approach, although it may
also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley’s losses and cash flows as
reserves are adjusted to reflect the development of negotiations and, ultimately,
potentially accelerated settlements.

There is less potential for similar
settlements with respect to the Company’s reinsurance asbestos claims. Ceding
companies, with their direct obligation to insureds and overall responsibility for claim
settlements, are not consistently aggressive in developing claim settlement information
and conveying this information to reinsurers, which can introduce significant and perhaps
inappropriate delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers. These
delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but


also restrict the
information available to estimate the reinsurers’ ultimate exposure. See the
discussion below under the heading “Financial Condition – Loss and LAE
Reserves”.

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

The
Company utilizes reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and
catastrophic loss occurrences. These agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a
portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances without relieving the
insurer of its obligation to the policyholder. In the event reinsurers were unable to meet
their obligations under these reinsurance agreements or were able to successfully
challenge losses ceded by the Company under the reinsurance contracts, the Company would
not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balance. In some
cases, the Company may hold partial collateral, including letters of credit and funds held
arrangements, for these agreements. The Company establishes reserves for uncollectible
balances based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding
balances. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the reserve for uncollectible balances was
$25.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively. To minimize exposure from uncollectible
reinsurance receivables, the Company has a reinsurance credit security committee that
generally evaluates the financial strength of a reinsurer prior to entering into a
reinsurance arrangement. Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written
in the U.S. are generally required to secure their obligations. Management believes that
adequate provision has been made for the Company’s uncollectible balances. Actual
uncollectible amounts may vary, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting
income in the period in which the change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Financial Condition – Reinsurance
Receivables” below.

PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED.

Premiums written by the Company are earned ratably over the periods of the related
insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned premium reserves are established
to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period. Such reserves are established
based upon reports received from ceding companies or computed using pro rata methods based
on statistical data. Premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not yet been
reported to the Company, are estimated and accrued. Standard accepted actuarial
methodologies are used to estimate earned but not reported premium at each financial
reporting date. These earned but not reported premiums are combined with reported earned
premiums to comprise the exposure base for determining the Company’s incurred losses
and loss and LAE reserves. Commission expense and incurred losses related to the change in
earned but not reported premium are not differentiated from current period reported
premium and the effects of both are included in current period company and segment
financial results. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following table displays the
estimated components of earned premiums at December 31 for the periods indicated:

INVESTMENT VALUATION.

The Company’s
investment portfolio consists of investments available for sale and equity securities.
Accordingly, these securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis. Most securities
are


traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available. The Company
holds some privately placed securities that are either valued by an investment advisor or
by the Company using cash flow projections. In 2005 and 2004, the Company owned interest
only strips that were accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20, which sets forth the
rules for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value due to
impairment. Unrealized gains and losses from market fluctuations are reflected as
comprehensive income, while market value declines that are considered other than temporary
impairments are reflected in the income statement as realized capital losses. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had unrealized gains net of tax of $214.6 million
and $292.3 million, respectively. The Company considers many factors when determining
whether a market value decline is other than temporary, including: (1) the length of time
the market value has been below book value, (2) the credit strength of the issuer, (3) the
issuer’s market sector, (4) the length of time to maturity and (5) for asset backed
securities, increases in prepayments. If management assessments change in the future, the
Company may ultimately record a realized loss after management originally concluded that
the decline in value was temporary. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH AND INVESTED ASSETS.

Aggregate invested assets, including cash and short-term investments, were $12,970.8
million at December 31, 2005, $11,530.2 million at December 31, 2004 and $9,321.3 million
at December 31, 2003. The increase in cash and invested assets in 2005 from 2004 resulted
primarily from $1,065.7 million in cash flows from operations generated during 2005 and
$758.3 million from net proceeds of issuance of common shares, partially offset by the
$250.0 million repayment of senior notes due March 15, 2005 and $77.8 million in net
pre-tax unrealized depreciation of the Company’s investments. The $2.2 billion
increase in cash and invested assets in 2004 from 2003 resulted primarily from $1,487.6
million in cash flows from operations generated during 2004, $320.0 million from net
proceeds of the issuance of junior subordinated debt securities, $250.0 million from net
proceeds of the issuance of senior notes and $40.1 million in net pre-tax unrealized
appreciation of the Company’s investments, partially offset by a $70.0 million
repayment on the revolving credit agreement.

The Company’s current investment
strategy generally seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified,
taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level
of liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is
adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company’s current and projected operating
results, market conditions and the Company’s tax position. The fixed maturities in
the investment portfolio are comprised of available for sale securities. With changes the
Company perceives in overall investment market conditions, the Company is reweighting its
overall portfolio to modestly increase the emphasis on total return. Additionally, the
Company has invested in equity securities, principally public equity index securities,
which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio.
Equity investments accounted for 26.4%, 17.5% and 4.9% of the Company’s
shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company from time to time invests
in interest only strips. The Company strategically invests in interest only strips in
response to movement in, and levels of, capital market interest rates. These investments
are aimed at mitigating potential decreases in unrealized appreciation on the
Company’s fixed income portfolio during a period where management judges that there
is very high potential for an increase in general interest rates. These fixed maturity
securities give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate
on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are
guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash flow from these investments
is primarily dependent upon the average life of the mortgage pool. Generally, as market
interest rates and, more specifically, market mortgage rates decline, mortgagors tend to
refinance which will decrease the average life of a mortgage pool and decrease expected
cash flows. Conversely, as market interest rates and, more specifically, market mortgage
rates rise, repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows will tend to rise.
Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to increase as general interest
rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These


movements are generally
counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the Company’s other fixed income
investments. Although the Company invested in interest only strips during 2005, 2004 and
2003, the Company had liquidated its positions in interest only strips and held no such
securities at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The increase in short-term
investments is due principally to maintaining liquidity to pay catastrophe losses as well
as to the issuance of common shares during the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in
equity securities reflects a modest and continuing reweighting of the Company’s
target investment mix.

The Company, because of its
historical income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of
income yield and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a
measure of performance than its overall income yield. However, in 2005, with changes the
Company perceived in overall investment market conditions, the Company continued to
reweight its view of total return and added $440.0 million in 2005 of equity securities
into the overall investment portfolio. The following table provides a comparison of the
Company’s total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry
benchmarks for the periods indicated:

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

Reinsurance receivables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled $1,048.7 million at
December 31, 2005, $1,210.8 million at December 31, 2004, and $1,284.1 million at December
31, 2003. At December 31, 2005, $239.8 million, or 22.9%, was receivable from subsidiaries
of London Life. These receivables are collateralized by a combination of letters of credit
and funds held arrangements under which the Company has retained the premium payments due
the retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced such liabilities
as payments are due from the retrocessionaire. In addition, $171.5 million, or 16.4%, was
receivable from Transatlantic, $160.0 million, or 15.3%, was receivable from LM, whose
obligations are guaranteed by The Prudential and $100.0 million, or 9.5%, was receivable
from Continental,


which is partially collaterized by funds held arrangements. No other
retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s receivables.

LOSS AND LAE RESERVES.

Gross
loss and LAE reserves totaled $9,126.7 million at December 31, 2005, $7,836.3 million at
December 31, 2004 and $6,361.2 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in 2005 is
primarily attributable to increased catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable net
prior period reserve adjustments and reduced premiums earned. The increase in 2004 and
2003 is primarily attributable to increased premiums earned, increase in catastrophe
losses and net prior period reserve adjustments in select areas. Normal variability in
claim settlements also affected both periods.

Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re
sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re. Business for this branch was previously
included in the International segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to
the sale and in accordance with FAS 131, the Company restated the International and
Bermuda segments for the years ended December 31, 2003 to conform to December 31, 2005 and
2004 segment reporting.

The following tables summarize gross
outstanding loss and LAE reserves by segment, segregated into case reserves and IBNR

The changes by segment generally
reflect changes in earned premium, changes in business mix, the impact of reserve
re-estimations and changes in catastrophe loss reserves, together with claim settlement
activity. The fluctuations for A&E reflect the impact of reserve re-evaluations and
claim settlement activity.

The Company’s loss and LAE
reserves reflect estimates of ultimate claim liability. Such estimates are re-evaluated on
an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into
consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim
experience. The effect of such re-evaluations impacts incurred losses for the current
period. The Company notes that its analytical methods and processes operate at multiple
levels including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of
business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the aggregate. The
complexities of the Company’s business and operations require analyses and
adjustments, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. Additionally, the
attribution of reserves, change in reserves and incurred losses between accident year and
underwriting year requires adjustments and allocations, both qualitative and quantitative,
at these various levels. All of these processes, methods and practices appropriately
balance actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended
to assure the accuracy, precision and consistency of the Company’s reserving
practices, which are fundamental to the Company’s operation. The Company notes
however, that the underlying reserves remain estimates, which are subject to variation,
and that the relative degree of variability is generally least when reserves are
considered in the aggregate and generally increases as the focus shifts to more granular
data levels.

There can be no assurance that
reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future. However,
management believes that the Company’s existing reserves and reserving methodologies
lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In this context,
the Company notes that over the past 10 years, its past calendar year operations have been
affected variably by effects from prior period reserve re-estimates, with such effects
ranging from a favorable $62.1 million in 1997, representing 2.2% of the net prior period
reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made, to an unfavorable $249.4 million
in 2004, representing 3.7% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the
adjustment was made. The Company has noted that variability had increased for years 1999
to 2003 and has taken actions to attempt to reduce this year to year variability
prospectively.


The following table represents the
reserve levels and ranges as of December 31, 2005 for each of the Company’s business
segments.

The Company has included ranges for
loss reserve estimates determined by the Company’s actuaries, which are derived
through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. The Company notes that its
presentation of this information is not directly comparable to similar presentations of
other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards
governing such presentations. The Company further notes that its recorded reserves reflect
the Company’s best point estimate of its liabilities and that its actuarial
methodologies focus on such point estimates around which ranges are subsequently
developed.

Depending on the specific segment,
the range derived for the loss reserves, excluding reserves for A&E exposures, ranges
from minus 8.0% to minus 14.0% for the low range and from plus 8.0% to plus 14.0% for the
high range. Both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the U.S. Insurance
segment. Within each range, management’s best estimate of loss reserves is based on
the point estimate

derived by the Company’s actuaries in detailed reserve
studies. Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted
actuarial standards with respect to their development. In particular, the Company notes
that the width of the range is dependent on the level of confidence associated with the
outcome. For the above presentation, management has assumed what it believes is a
reasonable confidence level but notes that there can be no assurance that the
Company’s claim obligations will not vary within and potentially outside of these
ranges, requiring incurred loss adjustments in the period the variability is recognized.
The Company is not able to establish a meaningful range for A&E reserves.

Additional losses, including those
relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type
or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the Company or the reinsurance and insurance
industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not
covered by existing retrocessional contracts, could have material adverse effects on the
Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


The Company generally has exposure to
A&E losses through its Mt. McKinley operation with respect to insurance policies and
through Everest Re with respect to reinsurance contracts. In each case, the Company’s
management and analysis of its exposures takes into account a number of features of its
business that differentiate the Company’s exposures from many other insurers and
reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures.

Mt.
          McKinley began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and
          increased the volume of its writings in 1977. These writings ceased in 1984,
          giving Mt. McKinley an approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure,
          which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with
          significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and
          standardization of policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s
          to have been issued without aggregate limits on at least the product liability
          coverage offered; policies issued in earlier decades are generally more at risk
          of not having aggregate limits.

The vast majority of Mt.
McKinley’s A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies, with
aggregate coverage limits, which by definition also have protection afforded by underlying
coverage. Mt. McKinley’s attachment points vary but usually are protected by
millions, often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying coverage. The excess nature of
most of Mt. McKinley’s policies also offers protection against
“non-product” claims (for example, claims arising under general liability
coverage). Although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to
non-product claims, such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because
non-product claims are generally less likely to aggregate. In addition, environmental
claims arise under general liability coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these
claims tend to create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess
policies.

Virtually all of the Mt. McKinley
policies that are still potentially exposed to claims have policy language providing that
expenses were paid within limits rather than in addition to limits. This is a substantial
difference from primary coverage, which would most often cover expenses in addition to
limits.

Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was
not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under which A&E exposures
generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E exposures through
contract exclusions effected in 1984. Therefore, Everest Re has an approximate 11-year
window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many reinsurance companies that have
significant A&E exposures. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re was not
as heavily involved in casualty business as in property business, which generally is not
exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re generally took smaller lines of exposure per
contract than many other reinsurers operating in the casualty reinsurance market and those
lines were generally also smaller than the excess limits provided by Mt. McKinley
policies. This means that the potential adverse development on Everest Re’s
reinsurance business would not be subject to the same level of volatility as would be the
case for companies having greater exposures per risk. Everest Re reinsured both primary
and excess policies. However, its claim experience to date indicates that the majority of
its reinsurance supported excess policies. As a result, most of Everest Re’s exposure
derives from excess policies similar to those written by Mt. McKinley.

With respect to both the Mt. McKinley
and Everest Re operations, the Company was not a member of the Asbestos Claims Facility
(“Wellington”) or the Center for Claims Resolution (“CCR”) claim
settlement facilities. Insurers supporting those facilities made broad commitments
concerning the application of insurance coverage to asbestos claims. With respect to its
direct insurance exposures, the fact that the Company has not made those commitments may
allow it to resolve insurance exposure to Wellington/CCR insureds more economically than
if it had joined these facilities. With respect to its reinsurance exposures, although the
Company was not a signatory to the Wellington or CCR facilities, it issued reinsurance
contracts to ceding companies that were signatories. Because the insurers supporting these
facilities have generally paid their exposures more quickly than non-signatory insurers,
the Company believes that this has generally meant that it has paid its reinsurance
exposure more quickly than it likely would have if it had not been subject to
Wellington/CCR payments.


The Company believes that its A&E
exposures are unique and differentiated, by the points noted above, from those insurers
and reinsurers with appreciable A&E exposure but there can be no assurance that such
factors will protect the Company from adverse development, perhaps material, or allow it
to secure advantages in the settlement of its claims obligations.

The following table summarizes
incurred losses with respect to A&E on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for
the periods indicated:

At December 31, 2005, the gross
reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $125.2 million representing case reserves
reported by ceding companies, $157.6 million representing additional case reserves
established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $243.5 million representing case
reserves established by the Company on direct insurance claims, including Mt. McKinley,
and $123.2 million representing IBNR reserves.

The gross incurred losses for A&E
exposures increased by $77.1 million and $171.7 million for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. These increases are the result of re-evaluations by
management reflecting additional information received from insureds and ceding companies,
ongoing litigation, additional claims received and settlement activity. Management closely
monitors this additional information and adjusts reserves accordingly. The net incurred
losses primarily reflect the impact of the reinsurance agreement between Mt. McKinley and
LM.

Industry analysts have developed a
measurement, known as the survival ratio, to compare the A&E reserves among companies
with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a
company’s current net reserves by the three year average of paid losses, and
therefore measures the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves
based on historical payment patterns. Using this measurement, the Company’s net three
year A&E survival ratio was 3.7 years at December 31, 2005. Adjusting for the effect
of the reinsurance ceded under the reinsurance agreement with LM, this ratio rises to the
equivalent of 5.0 years at December 31, 2005. The cession of $160.0 million to the stop
loss reinsurance provided by LM in connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley results
in unpaid proceeds that are not reflected in past net payments and effectively extend the
funding available for future net payments.


Because the survival ratio was
developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and not of absolute reserve
adequacy, the Company considers, but does not rely on, the survival ratio when evaluating
its reserves. In particular, the Company notes that loss payout variability, which can be
material, due in part to the Company’s orientation to negotiated settlements,
particularly on its Mt. McKinley exposures, significantly impairs the credibility and
utility of this measure as an analytical tool. During 2005, the Company made asbestos net
claim payments of $68.0 million on Mt McKinley high profile claimants where the claim was
either closed or a settlement was reached. Such payments, which are non-repetitive, do for
2005, and will for 2006 and 2007, distort the Company’s three year survival ratio.
Adjusting for such settlements, recognizing total settlements are generally considered
fully reserved to an agreed settlement, the Company considers that its adjusted A&E
survival ratio for net unsettled claims is 10.7 years, which is closer to prevailing
industry norms.

Developments in 2005 and 2004
affecting asbestos exposures in general and the Company’s asbestos exposures in
particular, together with enhancements in the Company’s claim management and
analytical processes, resulted in the reserve strengthening noted earlier. These
developments and actions have increased the emphasis on asbestos exposures as a separate
component of the Company’s A&E exposures. Despite the Company’s approach of
handling A&E exposures on a combined basis, management believes additional disclosure
of the asbestos element of its A&E exposures is appropriate.

The following tables summarize
reserve and claim activity for asbestos claims, on both a gross and net of ceded
reinsurance basis, for the periods indicated with particular emphasis on the
differentiation of insured categories within the Mt. McKinley operation, which the Company
believes reflects the most volatile element of its asbestos exposures for the years ended
December 31:




The Company’s net three year
survival ratio on its asbestos exposures only was 3.3 years for the period ended December
31, 2005. This three year survival ratio, when adjusted for the effect of the reinsurance
ceded under the stop loss cover from LM, was 4.8 years and, when adjusted for settlements
in place and structured settlements, which are either fully funded by reserves or subject
to financial terms that substantially limit the potential variability in the liability,
and the stop loss protection from LM, was 12.3 years.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY.

The
Company’s shareholders’ equity increased to $4,139.7 million as of December 31,
2005 from $3,712.5 million as of December 31, 2004, principally reflecting $758.3 million
in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares, partially offset by $218.7 million net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $77.8 million in net unrealized
appreciation of investments, a $27.0 million decrease in foreign currency translation,
$25.4 million in shareholder dividends and an increase of $2.9 million in the minimum
pension liability. The Company’s shareholders’ equity increased to $3,712.5
million as of December 31, 2004 from $3,164.9 million as of December 31, 2003, principally
reflecting $494.9 million of net income for the year ended December 31, 2004, $26.5
million in net proceeds from options exercised, an increase of $25.7 million in net
unrealized appreciation of investments and a $22.9 million increase in foreign currency
translation, partially offset by $22.4 million in shareholder dividends. Dividends
of $25.4 million, $22.4 million and $19.6 million were declared and paid by the Company in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

CAPITAL.

The Company’s business operations are in part dependent on the
Company’s financial strength, and the market’s perception thereof, as
measured by shareholders’ equity, which was $4,139.7 million and $3,712.5
million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has flexibility
with respect to capitalization as a result of its perceived financial strength,
including its financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating
agencies, and its access to the debt and equity markets. The Company
continuously monitors its capital and financial position, as well as investment
and security market conditions, both in general and with respect to the
Company’s securities, and responds accordingly.

From time to time, the Company has
used open market share repurchases to effectively adjust its capital position. It made no
such purchases in 2005 or in 2004. In September 2004, the Company’s authorization to
purchase its shares was amended to authorize the repurchase of up to 5 million shares. The
Company notes that, outside of its open market repurchase program, it repurchased 10,430
shares in 2005 and 4,800 shares in 2004 from employees in connection with restricted share
vestings where individual employees chose to discharge withholding tax liabilities on
vesting shares by the surrender of a portion of such shares and 328 shares in 2005 from a
non-employee in connection with payment of the option exercise price. At December 31,
2005, 5 million shares remained under the existing repurchase authorization.

On December 1, 2005 under the new
registration and offering revisions to the Securities Act of 1933, the Company filed a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, as a Well Known Seasoned Issuer.
Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group is authorized to issue common
shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings is
authorized to issue debt securities and Everest Re Capital Trust III (“Capital Trust
III”) is authorized to issue trust preferred securities.

•

On December 1, 2005, the Company issued 2,238,000 of its common shares at a price of
$102.89 per share, which resulted in $236.4 million of proceeds before expenses of
approximately $0.3 million and Holdings sold Group shares it acquired in 2002 at a price
of $102.89 per share, which resulted in $46.5 million of proceeds, before expenses of
approximately $0.2 million.

On June 27, 2003, the Company filed a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance of up to
$975 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group was
authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid
securities, Holdings was authorized to issue debt securities and Capital Trust II and
Capital Trust III were authorized to issue trust


preferred securities. This shelf
registration statement became effective on December 22, 2003 and was exhausted with the
October 6, 2005 transaction described below. The following securities were pursuant to
that registration statement.

•

On March 29, 2004, Capital Trust II, an unconsolidated affiliate, issued trust preferred
securities resulting in a takedown from the shelf registration statement of $320 million.
In conjunction with the issuance of Capital Trust II’s trust preferred securities,
Holdings issued $329.9 million of 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities due March 29,
2034 to Capital Trust II. Part of the proceeds from the junior subordinated debt
securities issuance was used for capital contributions to Holdings’ operating
subsidiaries.

•

On October 6, 2004, Holdings completed a public offering of $250.0 million principal
amount of 5.40% senior notes due October 15, 2014. The net proceeds were used to retire
existing debt at Holdings, which was due and retired on March 15, 2005.

•

On October 6, 2005, the Company expanded the size of the remaining shelf registration to
$486.0 million by filing under Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
General Instruction IV of Form S-3 promulgated there under. On the same date, the Company
entered into an agreement to issue 5,200,000 of its common shares at a price of $91.50 per
share, which resulted in $475.8 million in proceeds received on October 12, 2005, before
expenses of approximately $0.3 million. This transaction effectively exhausted the
December 22, 2003 shelf registration.

On July 30, 2002, the Company filed a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance of up to
$475.0 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group
was authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and
hybrid securities, Holdings was authorized to issue debt securities and Capital Trust was
authorized to issue trust preferred securities. This shelf registration statement became
effective on September 26, 2002 and was effectively exhausted with the April 23, 2003
transaction described below. The following securities were issued pursuant to that
registration statement.

•

On November 14, 2002, pursuant to a trust agreement between Holdings and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, the property trustee, and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, the Delaware trustee, Capital
Trust, an unconsolidated affiliate, completed a public offering of $210.0 million of 7.85%
trust preferred securities, resulting in net proceeds of $203.4 million. The proceeds of
the issuance were used to purchase $210 million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt
securities of Holdings that will be held in trust by the property trustee for the benefit
of the holders of the trust preferred securities. In conjunction with the issuance of
Capital Trust’s trust preferred securities, Holdings issued $216.5 million of 7.85%
junior subordinated debt securities due November 15, 2032 to Capital Trust. The proceeds
from the junior subordinated debt securities issuance were primarily used for capital
contributions to Holdings’ operating subsidiaries.

•

On April 23, 2003, the Company expanded the size of the remaining shelf registration to
$318 million by filing a post-effective amendment under Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, and General Instruction IV of Form S-3 promulgated thereunder. On the
same date, the Company issued 4,480,135 of its common shares at a price of $70.75 per
share, which resulted in $317.0 million in proceeds, before expenses of approximately $0.2
million. This transaction effectively exhausted the September 26, 2002 shelf registration.

Capital Trust will redeem all of the
outstanding trust preferred securities when the junior subordinated debt securities are
paid at maturity on November 15, 2032. Holdings may elect to redeem the junior
subordinated debt securities, in whole or in part, at any time after November 14, 2007. If
such an early redemption occurs, the outstanding trust preferred securities would also be
proportionately redeemed.


On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed
public offerings of $200.0 million principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15,
2010 and $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due and retired March 15,
2005. During 2000, the net proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were
distributed by Holdings to Group.

LIQUIDITY.

The Company’s current investment strategy generally seeks to maximize
          after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable bond and
          tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of
          liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is
          adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company’s current and projected
          operating results, market conditions and tax position. With changes the Company
          perceives in overall investment market conditions, the Company continues to
          reweight its view of total return and added $440.0 million in 2005 and $496.5
          million in 2004 of equity securities into the overall investment portfolio.

The Company’s liquidity
requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow
results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for
claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the
collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally
invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and investment income provides
additional funding for loss payments. The Company’s net cash flows from operating
activities were $1,065.7 million, $1,487.6 million and $1,653.8 million

for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additionally, these cash flows
reflected net tax payments of $110.9 million, $100.0 million and $52.6 million for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively; net catastrophe loss payments
of $459.7 million, $200.9 million and $96.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively; and net A&E settlements of $137.7 million, $187.1 million
and $43.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
decrease in net cash flows from operations in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to
higher claim payments on catastrophes combined with lower premium volume. The decrease in
cash flow in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to higher claim payments on
catastrophes and increased A&E settlements.

In periods for which disbursements
for claims and benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses exceed
premium inflows, cash flow from insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash
flow from operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income.
Additionally, cash flow from investment maturities and dispositions, both short term
investments and longer term maturities, would further mitigate the impact on total cash
flow.

As the exact timing of the payment of
claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains portfolios
of long term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments
that are intended to provide adequate cash for payment of claims. At December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004 the Company held cash and short-term investments of $1,551.0 million and
$770.8 million, respectively. Part of the elevated short-term cash position will be used
to pay catastrophe claims. In addition to these cash and short-term investments at
December 31, 2005, the Company had $0.4 billion, at fair value, of available for sale
fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less, $2.5 billion maturing within
one to five years and $7.2 billion maturing after five years. The Company’s $1.1
billion of equity securities are comprised primarily of securities that can be easily
liquidated. These fixed maturity and equity securities, in conjunction with the short-term
investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide adequate sources of liquidity
for the expected payment of losses in the near future. The Company does not anticipate
selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but has the
ability to do so. Sales might result in realized capital gains or losses and the Company
notes that at December 31, 2005 it had $214.6 million of net unrealized appreciation, net
of $125.5 million of taxes, comprised of $443.1 million of pre-tax appreciation and $103.0
million of pre-tax depreciation.


Management expects the trend of
positive cash flow from operations, which in general reflects the strength of overall
pricing, to persist over the near term; however, this continuing underlying trend will be
negatively impacted by future catastrophe payments. In the intermediate and long term, the
trend will be impacted by the extent to which competitive pressures change overall pricing
available in the Company’s markets and the extent to which the Company successfully
maintains its strategy of emphasizing profitability over volume.

Effective December 8, 2004, Group,
Bermuda Re, and Everest International entered into a three year, $750 million senior
credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Group Credit Facility”).
Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility. The Group Credit
Facility consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $250 million of revolving
credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of standby
letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the option of each of the
borrowers, be either (1) Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of the rate of
interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or the Federal
Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable
for the Group Credit Facility depend on Group’s senior unsecured debt rating. Tranche
two exclusively provides up to $500 million for the issuance of standby letters of credit
on a collateralized basis.

The Group Credit Facility requires
Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a
minimum net worth amount. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of (i) $2,599
million (base amount) plus (ii) (A) 25% of consolidated net income for each of
Group’s fiscal quarters and (B) 50% of any increase in consolidated net worth
attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. The base amount is reset at
the end of each fiscal year to be the greater of 70% of Group’s consolidated net
worth as of the last day of the fiscal year and the calculated minimum amount of net worth
prior to the last day of the fiscal year. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants.

During the year ended December 31,
2005, there were no borrowings under tranche one of the Group Credit Facility. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company had $122.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under
tranche two of the Group Credit Facility. In addition, the Company had $228.3 million in
letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005 under a $350 million bilateral
agreement with Citibank. All of these letters of credit are collateralized by the
Company’s cash and investments. These letters of credit are generally used to
collateralize reinsurance assumed by Bermuda Re from jurisdictions where collateralization
is generally required for the ceding company to receive credit for such reinsurance
recoverables from its principal regulator. Bermuda Re and Everest International also used
trust arrangements to provide collateralization to ceding companies, including affiliates.
The Company generally avoids providing collateral except where required for ceding
companies to receive credit from their regulators. Additionally, at December 31, 2005,
$164.4 million of assets were deposited in trust accounts, primarily on behalf of Bermuda
Re, as security for assumed losses payable to certain non-affiliated ceding companies.

Effective October 10, 2003, Holdings
entered into a three year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of lenders, replacing the December 21, 1999 three year senior revolving credit
facility, which expired on December 19, 2003. Both the October 10, 2003 and December 21,
1999 senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the
“Holdings Credit Facility”. Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the
Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general
corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to
$150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base
Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted LIBOR plus a margin. The Base Rate is the
higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime
rate or the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and
the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings’ senior
unsecured debt rating.


The Holdings Credit Facility requires
Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1, Holdings to
maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its
statutory surplus at $1.0 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of
future aggregate capital contributions after December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2005,
the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

During the year ended December 31,
2005, there were no payments made and no incremental borrowings under the Holdings Credit
Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2004, there were payments made of $70.0
million and there were no incremental borrowings made under Holdings Credit Facility.
During the year ended December 31, 2003, there were no payments made and no incremental
borrowings made under Holdings Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
there were outstanding Holdings Credit Facility borrowings of $0.0 million, $0.0 million
and $70.0 million, respectively.

Interest expense and fees incurred in
connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings Credit Facility were $0.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest expense and fees incurred in
connection with the Holdings Credit Facility were $1.2 million and $1.4 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company’s 2005 total cash
flow, as distinguished from its cash flow from operations, activity in 2005 included
$758.3 million of new investable cash from Group’s issuance of common shares and
Holdings’ sale of Group’s shares. The total cash flow activity in 2004 included
$320.0 million of new investable cash from Holdings’ issuance of junior subordinated
debt securities in March and $246.7 million of new investable cash from Holdings’
issuance of senior notes securities in October. The total cash flow activity in 2003
included $316.8 million of new investable cash resulting from Group’s offering of
common shares in April of that year.

EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES.

Like
other insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured
losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or
an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. Any such
catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one or more of the Company’s
reinsurance treaties, facultative certificates, or across lines of business, including
property and/or casualty.

The Company focuses on potential
losses that can be generated by any single event as part of its evaluation and monitoring
of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly, the Company employs
various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single
catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These techniques range from non-modeled
deterministic approaches—such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in
catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic damage factors—to modeled approaches
that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation
techniques that provide insights into the frequency and severity of expected losses on a
probabilistic basis.

To date, there is not one universal
model capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographical
regions that the Company conducts business. In addition, the form, quality, and
granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not always
fully aligned with the data requirements for the Company’s licensed model(s) creating
potential imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the results from
multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate
potential losses by and across business units. Such combination techniques are inherently
difficult to apply and may affect the precision of the Company’s estimates. Also,
most models have not been accurate in forecasting losses from the unprecedented series of
hurricanes that impacted the insurance industry in 2004 and 2005. In particular, many
models did not fully consider some of the perils and factors, which have been major
contributors to the scale of events like the Katrina loss, such as flood, storm surge, and
potential demand surge. Finally, uncertainties with respect to future climate patterns and
cycles introduce significant uncertainty with respect to the accuracy of loss projections
from models using historic long-term frequency and severity data.


Nevertheless, when combined with
traditional risk management and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models continue
to be a useful tool for underwriters to price cat-exposed risks and for providing
management with quantitative analysis with regard to monitoring and managing its
catastrophe risk exposure by zone and risk hazard.

Projected losses with respect to
catastrophe events are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss or PML.
The Company defines PML as its anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and
limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such
as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake. The expected PML will vary with the severity
of modeled simulated losses and vary with the in-force book of business. The projected
severity levels are described in terms of “return periods”, such as
“100-year events” and “250-year events”. Simply speaking, a 100-year
PML corresponds to a 1% probability that losses from an event could exceed the indicated
PML; alternatively, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss distribution for an
event falls below the indicated PML.

From a risk management perspective,
the Company continues to manage its catastrophe risk such that its largest individual
100-year event, on an after-tax basis, generally does not exceed approximately one-half of
projected net income. Management also monitors its largest PMLs at multiple
points along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250,
500, and 1,000 year return periods. This monitoring procedure enables management to
identify discrete risk zone and risk hazard exposure accumulations for integration into
risk, underwriting and capital management processes.

The Company’s catastrophe loss
projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a
formal risk management review process.

The Company believes that the
greatest 1 in 100 year catastrophe exposure world wide from any single event is to a
hurricane affecting the U.S. southeast coast where the Company estimates it has a pre-tax
PML exposure of $532 million. See also table under “Risk Management and Retrocession
Arrangements”.

If such a single catastrophe loss
were to occur, management estimates that the effect on the Company’s income before
and after taxes would be approximately $532 million and $415 million, respectively. Such
impact represents approximately 10.0% of the Company’s beginning of year capital.
Such estimates involve multiple variables, including which Everest entity would experience
the loss, and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be
exceeded.

The Company employs a retrocessional
approach under which the Company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business
written or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering the potential accumulation
or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the Company’s operations. All
reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market
conditions with respect to the pricing, terms, conditions and availability of such
coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective protection. The level of reinsurance
coverage varies over time, reflecting the underwriter’s and/or Company’s view of
the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets.

For 2004, 2005 and thus far in 2006,
the Company has chosen not to purchase corporate retrocessional protection and to
generally de-emphasize the purchase of specific reinsurance by its underwriters,
reflecting the Company’s view that its exposures, in the context of its capital and
financial position and current market pricing, do not warrant reinsurance purchases at
currently unattractive retrocessional price levels. For 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company
purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage, which provided up
to $175.0 million of recoveries per accident year if Everest Re’s consolidated
statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment point provided
in the contract for the respective accident years. Each arrangement provided for an
adjustment premium, which reduces the net benefit by approximately 50%, in the event that
the coverage is used. There are no remaining limits available under these


coverages. See
ITEM 1, “Business — Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession
Arrangements” for further details.

______________

(1)   Loss and LAE reserves represent the Company’s best estimate of losses from
               claim and related settlement costs. Both the amounts and timing of such payments
               are estimates, and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as
               changes in market conditions make the timing of cash outflows uncertain.
               Therefore, the ultimate amount and timing of loss and LAE payments could differ
               from the Company’s estimates.

The senior notes and junior
subordinated debt contractual obligations are the responsibility of Holdings. While the
Company has sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to
satisfy these obligations, Holdings generally depends for its funding upon dividends from
Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary, capital contributions from Group or access
to the capital markets. The Company’s various operating insurance and reinsurance
subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle outstanding
reserves for losses and LAE. Management believes that the Company, and each of its
entities, have sufficient financial resources, or ready access thereto, to meet all
obligations.

DIVIDENDS

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
Company declared and paid shareholder dividends of $25.4 million, $22.4 million and $19.6
million, respectively. As an insurance holding company, the Company is partially dependent
on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to
its shareholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest
Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by
Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. Management expects
that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest
Re’s ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Holdings’
general corporate needs and Holdings’ and Bermuda Re’s ability to declare and
pay dividends sufficient to support Group’s general corporate needs. For the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Everest Re paid dividends to Holdings of $75
million, $70 million and $45 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004 Bermuda Re paid dividends to Group of $45 million and $15 million, respectively.
See ITEM 1, “Business – Regulatory Matters – Dividends” and Note 14A
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

APPLICATION OF NEW
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In January 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Financial Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”). FIN 46
addresses whether certain types of entities, referred to as variable interest entities
(“VIEs”), should be consolidated or deconsolidated in a company’s financial
statements. During December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, replacing FIN 46. FIN 46R
became


effective, for entities that had not adopted FIN 46 as of December 24, 2003. The
Company adopted FIN 46R in the first quarter of 2004, resulting in the deconsolidation of
Capital Trust and Capital Trust II. For 2003, where applicable, the financial statements
have been restated to reflect the deconsolidation.

In December 2004, the FASB issued
FASB Statement 123(R) “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”). FAS 123(R)
requires all share-based compensation awards granted, modified or settled after December
15, 1994 to be accounted for using the fair value method of accounting. Under the modified
prospective application, compensation cost is recognized for the outstanding, non-vested
awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under FAS 123. As
the Company implemented FAS 123 prospectively for grants issued on or after January 1,
2002, the Company does not expect the adoption of the statement to have a material impact
on the Company’s financial condition or results of operation. The application of FAS
123(R) will become effective for fiscal years starting after June 15, 2005. The Company
will adopt FAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006.

In November 2005, the FASB issued the
FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 115-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“FAS 115-1”). FAS
115-1 would be applied prospectively and the effective date would be reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company continues to apply Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities” (“FAS 115”), and the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic
5:M, “Other Than Temporary Impairment Of Certain Investments In Debt And Equity
Securities” and believes that unrealized losses in its investment portfolio are
temporary in nature.

MARKET SENSITIVE
INSTRUMENTS

The SEC’s Financial Reporting
Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial
statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative
commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, “market
sensitive instruments”). The Company does not generally enter into market sensitive
instruments for trading purposes.

The Company’s current investment
strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable
and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of
liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted
continuously, consistent with its current and projected operating results, market
conditions and the Company’s tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment
portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, the
Company invests in equity securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted
total return of the investment portfolio. The Company has also engaged in a small number
of specialized equity put options.

The overall investment strategy
considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular,
estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability
transactions, together with the Company’s capital structure and other factors, are
used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout
characteristics for which the investments of the Company provide liquidity. This analysis
is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation,
duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure
principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period, including a
reduction of the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio that in turn reduced the impact
of interest rate shift on the entire portfolio.

The Company’s $13.0 billion
investment portfolio at December 31, 2005 is principally comprised of fixed maturity
securities, which are subject to interest rate risk and foreign currency rate risk, and
equity securities, which are subject to equity price risk. The impact of the foreign
exchange risks on the investment portfolio is generally mitigated by changes in the value
of operating assets and liabilities and their associated income statement impact.


Interest rate risk is the potential
change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, due to
change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, it includes
prepayment risk on the $1,527.2 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $10,042.1
million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated
principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the
security.

The tables below display the
potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on the
Company’s fixed maturity portfolio (including $1.4 billion of short-term investments)
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 based on parallel and immediate 200 basis point shifts in
interest rates up and down in 100 basis point increments. For legal entities with a U.S.
dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually. To
generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment
expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account. For legal
entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the
involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the
various interest rate change scenarios. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented
in millions.

The Company had $9,126.7 million and
$7,836.3 million of reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004. These amounts are recorded at their nominal or estimated ultimate payment amount, as
opposed to fair value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value
of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the fair value of the reserves
is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the fair value of the reserves
decreases and, conversely, if interest rates decline, the fair value will increase. These
movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments
since reserves are future obligations. While the difference between fair value and nominal
value is not reflected in the Company’s financial statements, the Company’
financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio
until the claims are paid. The Company’s loss and loss reserve obligations have an
expected duration of approximately 3.9 years, which is reasonably consistent with the
Company’s fixed income portfolio. If the company were to discount its loss and LAE
reserves, net of $1.0 billion of reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses, the discount
would be approximately $1.5 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of
approximately $6.6 billion, representing approximately 57% of the fixed maturity market
value. The existence of such obligations, and the variable differential between ultimate
and fair value, which in theory applies equally to invested assets and insurance
liabilities, provides substantial mitigation of the economic effects of interest rate
variability even though such mitigation is not reflected in the Company’s financial
statements.


Equity risk is the potential change in market value of the common stock and
preferred stock portfolios arising from changing equity prices. The Company’s equity
investments are mainly exchange traded and mutual funds, which invest principally in high
quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major exchanges in the U.S. The
primary objective in managing the equity portfolio is to provide long-term capital growth
through market appreciation and income.

The tables below display the impact
on market value and after-tax unrealized appreciation of a 20% change in equity prices up
and down in 10% increments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The growth in exposure is
primarily due to the growth in the equity portfolio. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and
are presented in millions.

Foreign currency rate risk is the
potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. Each of the Company’s non-U.S./Bermuda (“foreign”)
operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location
consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Generally, the Company prefers to maintain
the capital of its operations in U.S. dollar assets, although this varies by regulatory
jurisdiction in accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation may conduct business
in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates.
The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the Canadian
Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. The Company mitigates foreign exchange
exposure by a general matching of the currency and duration of its assets to its
corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 52 “Foreign Currency Translation”, the Company translates the
assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to
the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive
income.


The tables below display the
potential impact of a parallel and immediate 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange
rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure in 10%
increments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. This analysis includes the after-tax impact
of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax
impact of translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. The
reduction in exposure between 2005 and 2004 principally arises from the strengthening of
the U.S. dollar in relation to the British Pound Sterling and the Euro throughout the
year. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions.

Although not considered material in
the context of the Company’s aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments, the
Company has issued six specialized equity put options based on the S&P 500 index and
one specialized equity put option based on the FTSE 100 index, that are market sensitive
and sufficiently unique to warrant supplemental disclosure.

The Company has sold six specialized
equity put options based on the S&P 500 index for total consideration, net of
commissions, of $22.5 million. These contracts each have a single exercise date, with
original maturities ranging from 12 to 30 years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21
to $1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is
at or above the strike price on the exercise dates, which currently fall between June 2017
and March 2031. If the S&P 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable
exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the
index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the
December 31, 2005 index value, the Company estimates the probability for each contract of
the S&P 500 index being below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than
4.8%. The theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the
exercise dates the S&P 500 index value were zero. The present value of these
theoretical maximum payouts using a 6.0% discount factor is $201.2 million.

The company has sold one specialized
equity put option based on the FTSE 100 index for total consideration, net of commissions,
of $6.7 million. This contract has an exercise date of July 2020 and a strike price of
£5,989.75. No amount will be payable under this contract if the FTSE 100 index is at
or above the strike price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index is lower than the
strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately
with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical
index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2005 index value, the Company estimates
the probability for this FTSE 100 index contract being below the strike price on the
exercise date to be less than 8.4%. The theoretical maximum payout under the contract
would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was zero. The present value
of the theoretical maximum payout using a 6.0% discount factor and current exchange rate
is $24.2 million.

As these specialized equity put
options are derivatives within the framework of FAS 133, the Company reports the fair
value of these instruments in its balance sheet and records any changes to fair value in
its statement of operations. The Company has recorded fair values for its obligations on
these specialized equity put options at December 31, 2005 and 2004 of $36.3 million and
$21.5 million, respectively; however, the Company does not


believe that the ultimate
settlement of these transactions is likely to require a payment that would exceed the
initial consideration received or any payment at all.

As there is no active market for
these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted
option pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions, including those regarding
volatility and expected rates of return.

The tables below estimate the impact
of potential movements in interest rates and the equity indices, which are the principal
factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair value at
December 31, 2005 and 2004. These are estimates and there can be no assurance regarding
future market performance. The asymmetrical results of the interest rate and S&P 500
and FTSE 100 indices shift reflect that the liability cannot fall below zero whereas it
can increase to its theoretical maximum.

Controls and
Procedures

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial
reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that


controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

. Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of
December 31, 2005, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.

Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report in Part IV, Item
15, “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm”.

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the
Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, has evaluated our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether
any changes occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter covered by this annual report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change
during the fourth quarter.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Everest Re Group, Ltd.:

We have completed integrated audits
of Everest Re Group, Ltd.‘s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of
its internal control over financial reporting as of 2005, and an audit of its 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedules

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Everest Re Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index

present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over
financial reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control- Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control- Integrated
Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted
our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

F-2

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

EVEREST RE GROUP, LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. Business and Basis of
Presentation

Everest Re Group, Ltd.
(“Group”), a Bermuda company, was established in 1999 as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Everest Reinsurance Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”). On February 24,
2000, a corporate restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding
company of Holdings. Holders of shares of common stock of Holdings automatically became
holders of the same number of common shares of Group. Prior to the restructuring, Group
had no significant assets or capitalization and had not engaged in any business or prior
activities other than in connection with the restructuring. Group, through its
subsidiaries, principally provides reinsurance and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and
international markets. As used in this document, the “Company” means Group and
its subsidiaries. Prior to December 31, 2004, Group’s principal executive office was
located in Barbados. On December 31, 2004 the Company closed its principal executive
office in Barbados and established its principal executive office in Bermuda.

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The statements include the
following domestic and foreign direct and indirect subsidiaries of Group: Holdings,
Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda), Ltd. (“Bermuda Re”), Everest International
Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Everest International”), formerly AFC Re Ltd., Mt. McKinley
Insurance Company (“Mt. McKinley”), formerly Gibraltar Casualty Company, Everest
Global Services, Inc. (“Global Services”), Everest Advisors (UK), Ltd., Everest
Advisors (Ireland) Limited, Everest Re Advisors, Ltd., Everest Reinsurance Company
(“Everest Re”), Everest National Insurance Company (“Everest
National”), Everest Indemnity Insurance Company (“Everest Indemnity”),
Everest Re Holdings, Ltd. (“Everest Ltd.”), Everest Security Insurance Company
(“Everest Security”), formerly Southeastern Security Insurance Company, Everest
Insurance Company of Canada (“Everest Canada”), Mt. McKinley Managers, L.L.C.
(“Managers”), Workcare Southeast, Inc. (“Workcare Southeast”), and
Workcare Southeast of Georgia, Inc. (“Workcare Georgia”). All amounts are
reported in U.S. dollars.

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities (and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities) at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. Ultimate actual results could differ from those estimates.

B. Investments

Fixed maturity investments are all
classified as available for sale. Unrealized appreciation and depreciation, as a result of
temporary changes in market value during the period, are reflected in shareholders’
equity, net of income taxes in “accumulated other comprehensive income”. Equity
securities are carried at market value with unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as a
result of temporary changes in market value during the period, are reflected in
shareholders’ equity, net of income taxes in “accumulated other comprehensive
income”. Unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities, which are
deemed other than temporary, are charged to net income as realized capital losses.
Short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates market value. Realized gains
or losses on sale of investments are determined on the basis of identified cost. For
non-publicly traded securities, market prices are determined through the use of pricing
models that evaluate securities relative to the U.S. Treasury yield curve, taking into
account the issue type, credit quality and cash flow characteristics of each security. For
publicly traded securities, market value is based on quoted market prices. Retrospective

F-8

adjustments are employed to recalculate the values of loan-backed and asset-backed
securities. Each acquisition lot is reviewed to recalculate the effective yield. The
recalculated effective yield is used to derive a book value as if the new yield were
applied at the time of acquisition. Outstanding principal factors from the time of
acquisition to the adjustment date are used to calculate the prepayment history for all
applicable securities. Conditional prepayment rates, computed with life to date factor
histories and weighted average maturities, are used to affect the calculation of projected
and prepayments for pass-through security types. Other invested assets include limited
partnerships and rabbi trusts. Limited partnerships are valued pursuant to the equity
method of accounting, which management believes approximates market value. The
Supplemental Retirement Plan Rabbi Trust, the Deferred Compensation Plan Rabbi Trust and
the Supplemental Savings Plan Rabbi Trust are carried at market value. Cash includes cash
and bank time deposits with original maturities of ninety days or less.

C. Uncollectible
Receivable Balances

The Company provides reserves for
uncollectible reinsurance balances based on management’s assessment of the
collectibility of the outstanding balances. Such reserves were $38.6 million at December
31, 2005 and $37.1 million at December 31, 2004. See also Note 11.

D. Deferred Acquisition
Costs

Acquisition costs, consisting
principally of commissions and brokerage expenses and certain premium taxes and fees that
vary with and are directly associated with the Company’s reinsurance and insurance
business incurred at the time a contract or policy is issued, are deferred and amortized
over the period in which the related premiums are earned, generally one year. Deferred
acquisition costs are limited to their estimated realizable value based on the related
unearned premiums, anticipated claims and claim expenses and anticipated investment
income. Deferred acquisition costs amortized to income were $914.8 million, $975.2 million
and $863.9 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The present value of in force annuity
business is included in deferred acquisition costs. This value is amortized over the
expected life of the business at the time of acquisition. The amortization each year will
be a function of the gross profits each year in relation to the total gross profits
expected over the life of the business, discounted at an assumed net credit rate.

E. Reserve for Losses and
Loss Adjustment Expenses

The reserve for losses and loss
adjustment expenses (“LAE”) is based on individual case estimates and reports
received from ceding companies. A provision is included for losses and LAE incurred but
not reported (“IBNR”) based on past experience. A provision is also included for
certain potential liabilities relating to asbestos and environmental (“A&E”)
exposures, which liabilities cannot be estimated with traditional reserving techniques.
See also Note 3. The reserves are reviewed continually and any changes in estimates are
reflected in earnings in the period the adjustment is made. Management believes that
adequate provision has been made for the Company’s losses and LAE. Loss and LAE
reserves are presented gross of reinsurance receivables and incurred losses and LAE are
presented net of ceded reinsurance.

Accruals for contingent commission
liabilities are established for reinsurance contracts that provide for the stated
commission percentage to increase or decrease based on the loss experience of the
contract. Changes in the estimated liability for such arrangements are recorded as
contingent commissions. Accruals for contingent commission liabilities are determined
through the review of the contracts that have these adjustable features and are estimated
based on expected loss and LAE.

F. Future Policy Benefit
Reserve

Liabilities for future policy
benefits on annuity policies are carried at their accumulated values. Reserves for policy
benefits include both mortality and morbidity claims in the process of settlement and IBNR
claims.

F-9

Interest rate assumptions used to estimate liabilities for policy benefits range
from 3.8% to 7.3%. Actual experience in a particular period may vary.

G. Premium Revenues

Written premiums are earned ratably
over the periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned
premium reserves are established to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period.
Such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies or
computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data. Reinstatement premiums are
earned when written and relate to additional premium received on catastrophe reinsurance
coverages when limits are exhausted, but additional coverage is requested. Written and
earned premiums, and the related costs, which have not yet been reported to the Company
are estimated and accrued. Premiums are net of ceded reinsurance.

Annuity premiums are recognized as
revenue over the premium-paying period of the policies.

H. Income Taxes

Holdings and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Foreign branches of
subsidiaries file local tax returns as required. Group and its other subsidiaries, not
included in Holdings’ consolidated tax return, file separate company U.S. federal
income tax returns, where required. The UK branch of Bermuda Re files a UK income tax
return. Deferred income taxes have been recorded to recognize the tax effect of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and
liabilities.

I. Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities relating to
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date; revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using average
exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial
statements, net of deferred income taxes, are excluded from net income and accumulated in
shareholders’ equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
are recorded through the statement of operations.

J. Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are
calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if
options granted under various stock-based compensation plans were exercised resulting in
the issuance of common shares that then shared in the earnings of the entity. See also
Note 16.

Options to purchase 315,000 common
shares at prices ranging from $95.05 to $95.485 per share and 247,956 common shares at
prices ranging from $70.18 to $73.615 per share were outstanding at the end of 2005 and
2003, respectively, but were not included in the computation of earnings per diluted share
for the respective years because the options’ exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the common shares for each relevant period. All options to
purchase common shares at the end of 2004 were included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share as the average market price was greater than the options’ exercise
price of common shares during the relevant period. All outstanding options expire on or
between March 12, 2006 and September 21, 2015.

K. Segmentation

The Company,
through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S.
Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. See also Note 18.

L. Derivatives

The Company has outstanding seven
specialized equity put options in its product portfolio. These products meet the
definition of a derivative under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS
133”). The Company’s position in these contracts is unhedged and is accounted
for as a derivative in accordance with FAS 133. Accordingly, these contracts are carried
at fair value and are recorded in “Other liabilities” in the consolidated
balance sheets and changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive (loss) income.

M. Deposit Assets and
Liabilities

In the normal course of its
operations, the Company may enter into contracts that do not meet the risk transfer
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113, “Accounting and
Reporting for Reinsurance of Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts”. Such
contracts are accounted for using the deposit accounting method. For such contracts, the
Company originally records deposit liabilities for an amount equivalent to the assets
received. Actuarial studies are used to estimate the final liabilities under such
contracts with any change reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive (loss) income.

F-11

N. Stock-based Employee
Compensation

Prior to 2002, the Company accounted
for its stock-based employee compensation plans (See Note 16) under the recognition and
measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and related interpretations.
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“FAS 123”) prospectively to all employee awards granted,
modified or settled after January 1, 2002.

Had the compensation cost for the
Company’s stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at
the grant dates for awards granted under those plans prior to January 1, 2002 under those
plans consistent with the method of FAS 123, the Company’s net (loss) income and
earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

The fair value of each option grant
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions: (i) dividend yields ranging from 0.5% to 0.9%, (ii) expected
volatility ranging from 32.9% to 45.8%, (iii) risk-free interest rates ranging from a low
of 4.7% to a high of 7.0% and (iv) expected life of 7.3 to 7.5 years.

O. Policyholder Dividends

The Company issues certain insurance
policies with dividend payment features. These policyholders share in the operating
results of their respective policies in the form of dividends declared. Dividends to
policyholders are accrued during the period in which the related premiums are earned and
are determined based on the terms of the individual policies.

P. Application of New
Accounting Standards

In January 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Financial Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”). FIN 46
addresses whether certain types of entities, referred to as variable interest entities
(“VIEs”), should be consolidated or deconsolidated in a company’s financial
statements. During December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, replacing FIN 46. FIN 46R
became effective, for entities that had not adopted FIN 46, as of December 24, 2003. The
Company adopted FIN 46R in the first quarter of 2004, resulting in the deconsolidation of
Everest Re Capital Trust (“Capital Trust”) and Everest Re Capital Trust II
(“Capital Trust II”). For 2003, where applicable, the financial statements have
been restated to reflect the deconsolidation.

In December 2004, the FASB issued
FASB Statement 123(R) “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”). FAS 123(R)
requires all share-based compensation awards granted, modified or settled after December
15, 1994 to be accounted for using the fair value method of accounting. Under the modified
prospective application, compensation cost is recognized for the outstanding, non-vested
awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under FAS 123. As
the Company implemented FAS 123 prospectively for grants issued on or after January 1,
2002, the Company does not expect the adoption of the statement to have a material

F-12

impact
on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The application of FAS
123(R) is effective for fiscal years starting after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt
FAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006.

In November 2005, the FASB issued the
FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 115-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”, (“FAS 115-1”) was
issued to replace the guidance set forth in paragraphs 10-18 of Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments
and its Application to Certain Investments” (“EITF 03-1”), with references
to existing other than temporary impairment guidance. FAS 115-1 would be applied
prospectively and the effective date would be reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2005. The Company continues to apply Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”
(“FAS 115”), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)‘s
Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5:M, “Other Than Temporary Impairment Of Certain
Investments In Debt And Equity Securities” and believes that unrealized losses in its
investment portfolio are temporary in nature.

Q. Investments –
Interest Only Strips

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
Company invested in interest only strips of mortgage-backed securities (“interest
only strips”) in response to movement in, and levels of, capital market interest
rates. These securities give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated
coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments on the outstanding
mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash flow from
these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the mortgage pool.
Generally, as market interest rates and, more specifically, market mortgage rates decline,
mortgagors tend to refinance which will decrease the average life of a mortgage pool and
decrease expected cash flows. Conversely, as market interest rates and, more specifically,
mortgage rates rise, repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows will tend to rise.
Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to increase as general interest
rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These movements are generally
counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the Company’s other fixed income
investments. The Company held no interest only strips investments at December 31, 2005.

The Company accounts for its
investment in interest only strips in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.
99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained
Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets” (“EITF 99-20”). EITF
99-20 sets forth the rules for recognizing interest income on all credit-sensitive
mortgage and asset-backed securities and certain prepayment-sensitive securities,
including agency interest only strips, whether purchased or retained in securitization, as
well as the rules for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value
because of impairment. EITF 99-20 requires decreases in the valuation of residual
interests in securitizations to be recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the
residual interests through a charge to earnings, rather than an unrealized loss in
shareholders’ equity, when any portion of the decline in fair value is attributable
to, as defined by EITF 99-20, an impairment loss. The Company recorded a pre-tax and
after-tax realized capital loss due to impairments of $7.0 million and $5.6 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005; $65.1 million and $49.7 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $46.2 million and $37.3 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003. As a result of liquidating the
interest only strips portfolios, the Company recognized pre-tax and after-tax realized
capital gains of $41.3 million and $32.5 million, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2005 and pre-tax and after-tax realized capital gains of $118.2 million and
$91.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The Company frequently reviews its
investment portfolio for declines in market value and focuses its attention on securities
whose fair value has fallen below 80% of their amortized value at the time of review. The
Company then assesses whether the decline in value is temporary or “other than
temporary”. In making its assessment, the Company evaluates the current market and
interest rate environment as well as specific issuer information and the Company’s
ability and intent to hold to maturity. Generally, a change in the market or interest rate
environment does not constitute impairment but rather a temporary decline in market value.
Temporary declines in market value are recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other
comprehensive income. If the Company determines that the decline is “other than
temporary”, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value and a
realized loss is recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive (loss) income. The Company’s assessments are based on the issuer’s
current financial position and timeliness with respect to interest and/or principal
payments, and speed of repayments on asset-backed securities, as well as relevant
information provided by rating agencies, investment advisors and analysts.

The tables below display the
aggregate fair value and gross unrealized depreciation, by investment category and length
of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004:

The aggregate fair value and gross
unrealized losses related to investments in an unrealized loss position as of December 31,
2005 is $4,596.8 million and $103.1 million, respectively. The $48.9 million of unrealized
losses related to fixed maturity securities that have been in an unrealized loss position
for less than one year are primarily comprised of highly rated government, municipal and
corporate bonds and are primarily related to the general rise in interest rates occurring
throughout the year. Of these unrealized losses, $44.3 million are related to securities
that are rated investment grade or better by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organization.

The $1.7 million of unrealized losses
related to equity securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than
one year are primarily comprised of individual equity holdings whose respective market
sectors have experienced some price volatility in the latter part of the year.

The $52.5 million of unrealized
losses related to fixed maturity securities that have been in an unrealized loss position
for more than one year are also primarily comprised of highly rated government, municipal
and corporate bonds and are related to the general rise in interest rates occurring
throughout the year. Of these unrealized losses, $49.1 million are related to securities
that are rated investment grade or better by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organization.

The Company, given the size of its
investment portfolio and capital position, has the ability to hold these securities until
recovery of market value. In addition, all securities currently in an unrealized loss
position are current with respect to principal and interest payments.

F-16

The aggregate fair value and gross
unrealized losses related to investments in an unrealized loss position as of December 31,
2004 is $2,154.0 million and $31.3 million, respectively. The $16.6 million of unrealized
losses related to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for one year or
less are primarily comprised of highly rated government, municipal and corporate bonds and
are primarily related to the general movements in interest rates throughout the year. Of
these unrealized losses, $14.8 million are related to securities that are rated investment
grade or better by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization.

The $14.7 million of unrealized
losses related to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for one year or
more are also primarily comprised of highly rated government, municipal and corporate
bonds and generally relate to the general movements in interest rates throughout the year.
Of these unrealized losses, $13.1 million are related to securities that are rated
investment grade or better by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization.

The components of net investment
income are presented in the table below:

Other investment income for 2005,
2004 and 2003 primarily includes income on limited partnership investments of $11.5
million, $41.8 million and $17.5 million, respectively.

F-17

The Company has contractual
commitments to invest up to an additional $311.2 million related to its limited
partnership investments at December 31, 2005. These commitments will be funded as required
by the partnership agreements, which have investment periods that expire no later than
2011.

Proceeds from sales of fixed maturity
investments during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $1,420.3 million, $1,451.2 million and
$1,219.0 million, respectively. Gross gains of $89.6 million, $163.8 million and $49.9
million and gross losses of $5.3 million, $8.3 million and $16.8 million were realized on
those fixed maturity sales during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Proceeds from sales
of equity security investments during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $218.0 million, $18.0
million and $8.1 million, respectively. Gross gains of $16.6 million, $0.5 million and
$0.8 million and gross losses of $3.6 million, $0.9 million and $0.0 million were realized
on those equity sales during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Realized capital gains (losses)
include $7.0 million, $65.1 million and $46.2 million of realized capital losses for 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the impairment of interest only strips in
accordance with EITF 99-20. In addition, realized capital losses for 2005, 2004 and 2003
included $0.0 million, $0.5 million and $25.7 million, respectively, related to
write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary
basis.

Securities with a carrying value
amount of $1,319.4 million at December 31, 2005 were on deposit with various state or
governmental insurance departments in compliance with insurance laws.

The Company has sold six specialized
equity put options based on the Standard & Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”)
index for total consideration, net of commission, of $22.5 million. At December 31, 2005,
fair value for these equity put options was $30.4 million. These contracts each have a
single exercise date, with original maturities ranging from 12 to 30 years and strike
prices ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these
contracts if the S&P 500 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise dates,
which currently fall between June 2017 and March 2031. If the S&P 500 index is lower
than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due would vary
proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. The
theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise
dates the S&P 500 index value were zero. The present value of these theoretical
maximum payouts using a 6% discount factor is $201.2 million. Based on historical index
volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2005 index value, the Company estimates the
probability for each contract of the S&P 500 index being below the strike price on the
exercise date ranges from .20% to 4.71%.

The Company has sold one specialized
equity put option based on the FTSE 100 index for total consideration, net of commissions,
of $6.7 million. At December 31, 2005, fair value for this equity put option was $6.0
million. This contract has an exercise date of July 2020 and a strike price of
£5,989.75. No amount will be payable under this contract if the FTSE 100 index is at
or above the strike price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index is lower than the
strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately
with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. The theoretical maximum
payout under the contract would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was
zero. The present value of the

F-18

theoretical maximum payout using a 6.0% discount factor and
current exchange rate is $24.2 million. Based on historical index volatilities and trends
and the December 31, 2005 index value, the Company estimates the probability for this FTSE
100 index contract being below the strike price on the exercise date to be 8.35%.

These specialized equity put options
meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. The Company’s position in these
contracts is unhedged and is accounted for as a derivative in accordance with FAS 133.
Accordingly, these contracts are carried at fair value and are recorded in “Other
liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets and changes in fair value are
recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.

As there is no active market for
these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted
option pricing model, Black-Scholes, which requires estimates and assumptions, including
those regarding volatility and expected rates of return.

3.    
          RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LAE

Activity in the reserve for losses
and LAE is summarized as follows:

Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled
$9,126.7 million at December 31, 2005, $7,836.3 million at December 31, 2004 and $6,361.2
million at December 31, 2003. The increase in 2005 is primarily attributable to elevated
catastrophe loss reserves, partially offset by an increase in claim settlements, a
decrease in premiums earned and favorable net prior period reserve adjustments. The
increase in 2004 is primarily attributable to increased premiums earned, net prior period
reserve adjustments in select areas, increase in catastrophe losses and normal variability
in claim settlements.

Reinsurance receivables for both paid
and unpaid losses totaled $1,048.7 million at December 31, 2005, $1,210.8 million at
December 31, 2004 and $1,284.1 million at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2005, $239.8
million, or 22.9%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Reinsurance Group
(“London Life”). These receivables are collateralized by a combination of
letters of credit and funds held arrangements under which the Company has retained the
premium payments due the retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for such amounts

F-19

and
reduced such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire. In addition,
$171.5 million, or 16.4%, was receivable from Transatlantic Reinsurance Company
(“Transatlantic”), $160.0 million, or 15.3%, was receivable from LM Property and
Casualty Insurance Company (“LM”), which in late 2003 purchased Prudential
Property and Casualty Insurance Company of Indiana (“Prupac”) and whose
obligations continue to be guaranteed by The Prudential Insurance Company of America
(“The Prudential”) and $100.0 million, or 9.5%, was receivable from Continental
Insurance Company (“Continental”), which is partially collateralized by funds
held arrangements. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the
Company’s receivables.

The Company’s current estimate
for recent catastrophe losses is based on modeled information, underwriter analysis and
judgments, client input and discussion, event modeling and profiling of exposed limits.
The Company expects it will be several quarters before relative clarity emerges with
respect to ceding companies’ underlying losses. As a result, losses may ultimately be
materially greater than the Company’s initial estimated losses. Any future
adjustments to estimated pre-tax catastrophe losses will have an impact on incurred losses
in the quarters during which such adjustments are made, and such impacts could be
material.

Net prior period reserve adjustments
were favorable in 2005 ($26.4 million) and unfavorable in 2004 ($249.4 million). The decrease in 2005 was
primarily the result of favorable reserve development for non-A&E, non-catastrophe
losses of $226.3 million, partially offset by unfavorable catastrophe loss development of
$118.5 million and A&E loss development of $81.4 million. In 2004, the increase was
the result of unfavorable reserve development for A&E of $159.4 million and
non-A&E, non-catastrophe of $128.7 million, partially offset by favorable reserve
development of $38.7 million for catastrophes.

The Company continues to receive
claims under expired contracts, both insurance and reinsurance, asserting alleged injuries
and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous
substances, including asbestos (i.e. A&E). The Company’s asbestos claims
typically involve potential liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for
property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos. The
Company’s environmental claims typically involve potential liability for (a) the
mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property
damages caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water.

As of December 31, 2005, roughly 7%
of the Company’s gross reserves are an estimate of the Company’s ultimate
liability for A&E claims. This estimate is made based on a judgmental assessment of
the underlying exposures as the result of (1) long and variable reporting delays, both
from insureds to insurance companies and from ceding companies to reinsurers; (2)
historical data, which is more limited and variable on A&E losses than historical
information on other types of casualty claims; and (3) unique aspects of A&E exposures
for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. There
are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company’s potential
losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potentially long waiting
periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b)
difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination; (c)
difficulty in properly

F-20

allocating responsibility and/or liability for asbestos or
environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those
laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance
providers over many policy periods; (f) questions concerning interpretation and
application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g) uncertainty regarding the
number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure.

With respect to asbestos claims in
particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound
the difficulty in estimating the Company’s liability. These developments include: (a)
continued growth in the number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive
plaintiff bar and including claims against defendants who may only have had a
“peripheral” condition to asbestos; (b) a disproportionate percentage of claims
filed by individuals with no functional injury, which should have little to no financial
value but that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the
growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of
asbestos claims (including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in which companies attempt
to resolve their asbestos liabilities in a manner that is prejudicial to insurers and
forecloses insurers from participating in the negotiation of asbestos related bankruptcy
reorganization plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a small number of states that
favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims that might impact the general
liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product liability portion; (f)
measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst procedural abuses; (g) an
increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants, especially those with
cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some states to address asbestos
litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or the U. S. Congress may adopt
legislation on asbestos litigation.

Management believes that these
uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for A&E and particularly
asbestos losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves
for other types of losses. Given these uncertainties, management believes that no
meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established particularly for asbestos.
Further, A&E reserves may be subject to more variability than non-A&E reserves and
such variation could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. The Company establishes reserves to
the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an
exposure for the Company or its ceding companies.

The following table summarizes
incurred losses with respect to A&E on both a gross and net of retrocessional basis
for the periods indicated:

The Company’s A&E
liabilities stem from Mt. McKinley’s direct excess insurance business and Everest
Re’s assumed business. At December 31, 2005, the gross reserves for A&E losses
were comprised of $125.2 million representing case reserves reported by ceding companies,
$157.6 million representing additional case reserves

F-21

established by the Company on assumed
reinsurance claims, $243.5 million representing case reserves established by the Company
on direct excess insurance claims, including Mt. McKinley and $123.2 million representing
IBNR reserves. Roughly 88% or $568.9 million of gross A&E reserves relate to asbestos
of which $313.4 million was for assumed business and $255.5 million was for direct excess
business.

In connection with the acquisition of
Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, LM provided reinsurance to
Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the first $200.0 million of any adverse
development of Mt. McKinley’s reserves as of September 19, 2000 and The Prudential
guaranteed LM’s obligations to Mt. McKinley. Cessions under this reinsurance
agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at December 31, 2003.

With respect to Mt. McKinley, where
the Company has a direct relationship with policyholders, the Company’s aggressive
litigation posture and the uncertainties inherent in the asbestos coverage and bankruptcy
litigation have provided an opportunity to actively engage in settlement negotiations with
a number of those policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities.
Those discussions are oriented towards achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that
limit Mt. McKinley’s liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. In 2004 and
2005, the Company concluded such settlements or reached agreement in principle with 13 of
its high profile policyholders. The Company has currently identified 10 policyholders
based on their past claim activity and/or potential future liabilities as “High
Profile Policyholders” and its settlement efforts are generally directed at such
policyholders, in part because their exposures have developed to the point where both the
policyholder and the Company have sufficient information to be motivated to settle. The
Company believes that this active approach will ultimately result in a more cost-effective
liquidation of Mt. McKinley’s liabilities than a passive approach, although it may
also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley’s losses and cash flows as
reserves are adjusted to reflect the development of negotiations and, ultimately,
potentially accelerated settlements.

There is less potential for similar
settlements with respect to the Company’s reinsurance asbestos claims. Ceding
companies, with their direct obligation to insureds and overall responsibility for claim
settlements, are not consistently aggressive in developing claim settlement information
and conveying this information to reinsurers, which can introduce significant and perhaps
inappropriate delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers. These
delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but also restrict the
information available to estimate the reinsurers’ ultimate exposure.

4.    
          CREDIT LINE

Effective December 8, 2004, Group,
Bermuda Re, and Everest International entered into a three year, $750 million senior
credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Group Credit Facility”).
Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility. The Group Credit
Facility consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $250 million of revolving
credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of standby
letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the option of each of the
borrowers, be either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of
the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or
the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the
fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depend on Group’s senior unsecured debt
rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500 million for the issuance of standby
letters of credit on a collateralized basis.

The Group Credit Facility requires
Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a
minimum net worth amount. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of (i) $2,599
million (base amount) plus (ii) (A) 25% of consolidated net income for each of
Group’s fiscal quarters and (B) 50% of any increase in consolidated net worth
attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. The base amount is reset at
the end of each fiscal year to be the greater of 70% of Group’s consolidated net
worth as of the

F-22

last day of the fiscal year and the calculated minimum amount of net worth
prior to the last day of the fiscal year. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants.

For the year ended December 31, 2005,
there were no borrowings under tranche one of the Group Credit Facility. During the year
ended December 31, 2005, there was $122.2 million used of the $500 million available for
tranche two standby letters of credit. See Note 7.

Effective October 10, 2003, Holdings
entered into a new three year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of lenders, replacing the December 21, 1999 three year senior revolving credit
facility, which expired on December 19, 2003. Both the October 10, 2003 and December 21,
1999 senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the
“Holdings Credit Facility”. Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the
Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general
corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to
$150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base
Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted LIBOR plus a margin. The Base Rate is the
higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime
rate or the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and
the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings’ senior
unsecured debt rating.

The Holdings Credit Facility requires
Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1, Holdings to
maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its
statutory surplus at $1.0 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of
future aggregate capital contributions after December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2005,
the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

During the year ended December 31,
2005 there were no payments made and no incremental borrowings under the Holdings Credit
Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2004 there were $70.0 million in payments and
no incremental borrowings under the Holdings Credit Facility. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, there were no payments made and no incremental borrowings under the
Holdings Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no outstanding
Holdings Credit Facility borrowings.

Interest expense and fees incurred in
connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings Credit Facility were $0.4
million, $1.2 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and
2003 respectively.

5.    
          SENIOR NOTES

On October 12, 2004, Holdings
completed a public offering of $250.0 million principal amount of 5.40% senior notes due
October 15, 2014. On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed public offerings of $200.0 million
principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15, 2010 and $250.0 million principal
amount of 8.50% senior notes due and retired March 15, 2005.

Interest expense incurred in
connection with these senior notes was $35.5 million, $42.0 million and $38.9 million for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Market value, which is
based on quoted market price at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $250.9 million and $250.3
million, respectively, for the 5.40% senior notes and $226.2 million and $236.7 million,
respectively, for the 8.75% senior notes.

6.    
          JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES PAYABLE

On March 29, 2004, Holdings issued
$329.9 million of 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities due March 29, 2034 to Capital
Trust II. Holdings can redeem the junior subordinated debt securities before their
maturity at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest as of the date of
redemption, in whole or in part, on one or

F-23

more occasions at any time on or after March
30, 2009; or at any time, in whole, but not in part, within 90 days of the occurrence and
continuation of specific events.

On November 14, 2002, Holdings issued
$216.5 million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities due November 15, 2032 to
Capital Trust. Holdings can redeem the junior subordinated debt securities before their
maturity at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest as of the date of
redemption, in whole or in part, on one or more occasions at any time on or after November
14, 2007; or at any time, in whole, but not in part, within 90 days of the occurrence and
continuation of specific events.

Fair value, which is primarily based
on quoted market price of the related trust preferred securities at December 31, 2005 and
2004, was $293.5 million and $309.9 million, respectively, for the 6.20% junior
subordinated debt securities and $220.5 million and $238.8 million, respectively, for the
7.85% junior subordinated debt securities.

Interest expense incurred in
connection with these junior subordinated notes was $37.5 million, $32.4 million and $17.0
million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Capital Trust and Capital Trust II
are wholly owned finance subsidiaries of Holdings.

Holdings considers that the
mechanisms and obligations relating to the trust preferred securities, taken together,
constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by Holdings of Capital Trust and Capital
Trust II’s payment obligations with respect to their respective trust preferred
securities.

There are certain regulatory and
contractual restrictions on the ability of Holdings’ operating subsidiaries to
transfer funds to Holdings in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The insurance
laws of the State of Delaware, where Holdings’ direct insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled, require regulatory approval before those subsidiaries can pay dividends or make
loans or advances to Holdings that exceed certain statutory thresholds. In addition, the
terms of Holdings’ Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4) require Everest Re,
Holdings’ principal insurance subsidiary, to maintain a certain statutory surplus
level as measured at the end of each fiscal year. At December 31, 2005, $2,112.0 million
of the $2,724.9 million in net assets of Holdings’ consolidated subsidiaries were
subject to the foregoing regulatory restrictions.

7.    
          LETTERS OF CREDIT

The Company has arrangements
available for the issuance of letters of credit, which letters are generally
collateralized by the Company’s cash and investments. The Company’s agreement
with Citibank is a bilateral letter of credit agreement only, while the Company’s
other facility, the Wachovia Syndicated Facility, involves a syndicate of lenders (see
Note 4, tranche two of the Group Credit Facility), with Wachovia acting as administrative
agent. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, letters of credit for $350.6 million and $350.9
million, respectively, were issued and outstanding, generally supporting reinsurance
provided by the Company’s non-U.S. operations. The following table summarizes the
Company’s letters of credit as of December 31, 2005. All dollar amounts are in
thousands.

8.    
          TRUST AGREEMENTS

Certain subsidiaries of the Company,
principally Bermuda Re, a Bermuda insurance company and direct subsidiary of Group, have
established trust agreements as security for assumed losses payable to certain
non-affiliated ceding companies, which effectively use Company investments as collateral.
At December 31, 2005, the total amount on deposit in trust accounts was $164.4 million.

terms of which range from 2007 to 2013, are for the rental of office space. Rental
expense, net of sublease rental income, was $7.1 million, $7.6 million and $6.8 million
for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

10.    
          INCOME TAXES

Under current Bermuda law, no income
or capital gains taxes are imposed on Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries. The Minister of
Finance of Bermuda has also assured Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries that, pursuant to
The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966, they will be exempt until 2016 from
any such taxes imposed in the future.

All the income of Group’s U.S.
subsidiaries is subject to the applicable federal, foreign, state and local taxes on
corporations. Additionally, the income of foreign branches of the Company’s insurance
operating companies, in particular the UK branch of Bermuda Re, is subject to various
income taxes. The provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive (loss) income has been determined by reference to the individual income
of each entity and the respective applicable tax laws. It reflects the permanent
differences between financial and taxable income relevant to each entity. The significant
components of the provision are as follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax
effect of the temporary differences between the value of assets and liabilities for
financial statement purposes and such values as measured by the U.S. tax laws and
regulations. The principal items making up the net deferred income tax asset are as
follows:

For U.S. income tax purposes the
Company has foreign tax credit carryforwards of $43.2 million that begin to expire in
2011. In addition, for U.S. income tax purposes the Company has $35.7 million of
Alternative Minimum Tax credits that do not expire. Management believes that it is more
likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets
and, accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded for the periods presented.

F-27

Tax benefits of $5.6 million and $8.4
million related to compensation expense deductions for stock options exercised in 2005 and
2004, respectively, are reflected in the change in shareholders’ equity in
“additional paid in capital”. In addition, during 2005, the Company sold
treasury shares resulting in proceeds of $46.5 million compared with a cost basis of $23.0
million. Additional paid in capital was reduced by $8.2 million of income taxes resulting
from this transaction.

11.    
          REINSURANCE

The Company utilizes reinsurance
agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. These
agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and LAE under
certain circumstances without relieving the insurer of its obligation to the policyholder.
Losses and LAE incurred and premiums earned are after deduction for reinsurance. In the
event reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under reinsurance agreements, the
Company would not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable
balances. The Company may hold partial collateral, including letters of credit and funds
held, under these agreements. See also Note 1C.

The Company considers purchasing
corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of
exposures. Such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the
availability of cost-effective retrocessional protection. For years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss
retrocession coverage that provided up to $175.0 million of coverage for each year. These
excess of loss policies provided coverage if Everest Re’s consolidated statutory
basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a specified loss ratio attachment point for each
year of coverage. The attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included
adjustable premium provisions that effectively caused the Company to offset, on a pre-tax
income basis up to approximately 57% of such ceded losses. The maximum recovery for each
year is $175.0 million before giving effect to the adjustable premium. During 2003, the
Company ceded $85.0 million of losses, to the 2000 cover, effectively exhausting the
maximum limit under the contract. The 2001 and 1999 accident year aggregate excess of loss
retrocession coverages were fully exhausted prior to January 1, 2003. The Company did not
purchase similar corporate level coverage subsequent to December 31, 2001.

In addition, the Company had coverage
under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by LM in connection with
the Company’s acquisition of Mt. McKinley in September 2000. This agreement covers
80% or $160 million of the first $200 million of any adverse loss reserve development on
the carried reserves of Mt. McKinley at the date of acquisition and reimburses the Company
as such losses are paid by the Company. There were $160.0 million of cessions under this
reinsurance at December 31, 2003, exhausting the limit available under the contract. The
Prudential continues to guarantee LM’s obligation under this agreement.

F-28

Premiums written and earned are
comprised of the following:

The amounts deducted from losses and
LAE incurred for net reinsurance recoveries were $95.2 million, $141.0 million and $278.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company
carried as an asset $1,048.7 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses
ceded. Of this amount, $239.8 million, or 22.9%, was receivable from subsidiaries of
London Life, $171.5 million, or 16.4%, was receivable from Transatlantic, $160.0 million,
or 15.3%, was receivable from LM and $100.0 million, or 9.5%, was receivable from
Continental. As of December 31, 2004, the Company carried as an asset $1,210.8 million in
reinsurance receivables with respect to losses ceded. Of this amount, $405.0 million, or
33.4%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Life, $160.0 million, or 13.2%, was
receivable from LM, $132.5 million, or 10.9%, was receivable from Transatlantic and $100.0
million, or 8.3%, was receivable from Continental. No other retrocessionaire accounted for
more than 5% of the Company’s receivables.

The Company’s arrangements with
London Life and Continental are managed on a funds held basis, which means that the
Company has not released premium payments to the retrocessionaire but rather retains such
payments to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire, records them as a liability,
credits interest on the balances at a stated contractual rate and reduces the liability
account as payments become due. As of December 31, 2005, such funds had reduced the
Company’s net exposure to London Life to $115.4 million, effectively 100% of which
has been secured by letters of credit, and its exposure to Continental to $38.7 million.
As of December 31, 2004, such funds had reduced the Company’s net exposure to London
Life to $184.1 million, effectively 100% of which has been secured by letters of credit,
and its exposure to Continental to $43.7 million.

13.    
          EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

A. Defined Benefit
Pension Plans

The Company maintains both qualified
and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its U.S. employees. Generally, the
Company computes the benefits based on average earnings over a period prescribed by the
plans and credited length of service. The Company’s non-qualified defined benefit
pension plan, affected in October 1995, provides compensating pension benefits for
participants whose benefits have been curtailed under the qualified plan due to Internal
Revenue Code limitations.

Although not required to make
contributions under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, the Company contributed $3.9
million and $3.2 million to the qualified and non-qualified plans, respectively, in 2005
and $3.3 million and $1.5 million to the qualified and non-qualified plans, respectively,
in 2004. Pension expense for the Company’s plans for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 was $7.1 million, $4.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively.

F-31

The following table summarizes the
status of these defined benefit plans for its U.S. employees for the periods indicated:

Plan assets are
comprised of shares in investment trusts with approximately 68% and 32% of the underlying
assets consisting of equity securities and fixed maturities, respectively.

The Company engages a third party
investment administrator to manage the qualified and non-qualified plan for its U.S.
employees. The assets in both plans consist of debt and equity mutual funds. Due to the
long term nature of the plans, the target asset allocation for each plan consists of 70%
equities and 30% bonds.

The Company expects to contribute
approximately $4.0 million and $2.4 million in 2006 to the qualified and non-qualified
plan, respectively.

B. Defined Contribution
Plans

The Company also maintains both
qualified and non-qualified defined contribution plans (“Savings Plan” and
“Non-Qualified Savings Plan”, respectively) covering U.S. employees. Under the
plans, the Company contributes up to a maximum 3% of the participants’ compensation
based on the contribution percentage of the employee. The Non-Qualified Savings Plan
provides compensating savings plan benefits for participants whose benefits have been
curtailed under the Savings Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations. The
Company’s incurred expenses related to these plans were $1.0 million, $1.0 million
and $0.8 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In addition, the Company maintains
several defined contribution pension plans covering non-U.S. employees. Each non-U.S.
office (Canada, London, Belgium, Singapore and Bermuda) maintains a separate plan for the
non-U.S. employees working in that location. The Company contributes various amounts based
on salary, age, and/or years of service. The contributions as a percentage of salary for
the branch offices range from 2% to 12%. The contributions are generally used to purchase
pension benefits from local insurance providers. The Company’s incurred expenses
related to these plans were $0.5 million for 2005 and $0.4 million for 2004 and 2003.

F-33

C. Post-retirement Plan

Beginning January 1, 2002, the
Company established the Retiree Health Plan. This plan provides health care benefits for
eligible retired employees (and their eligible dependants), who have elected coverage. The
Company currently anticipates that most covered employees will become eligible for these
benefits if they retire while working for the Company. The cost of these benefits is
shared with the retiree. The Company accrues the postretirement benefit expense during the
period of the employee’s service.

A health care inflation rate for
pre-Medicare claims of 10% in 2005 was assumed to remain at 10% in 2006, decrease one
percentage point annually to 5% in 2011 and then remain at that level.

A health care inflation rate for
post-Medicare claims of 6% in 2005, was assumed to remain at to 6% in 2006, decrease one
percentage point to 5% in 2007 and then remain at that level.

Changes in the assumed health care
cost trend can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
plans. A one percent change in the rate would have the following effects on:

          DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS AND STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

A. Dividend Restrictions

Under Bermuda law, Group is
prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would reduce the realizable
value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its
issued share capital and share premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts. Group’s
ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is dependent upon dividends from its
subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends by insurer subsidiaries is limited under
Bermuda law and the laws of the various U.S. states in which Group’s insurance and
reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled. The limitations are generally
based upon net income and compliance with applicable policyholders’ surplus or
minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio requirements as determined in accordance with
the relevant statutory accounting practices.

Under Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is
prohibited from declaring or making payment of a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum
solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is also
unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless, after
payment of the dividend, the value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as
certified by its approved actuary, exceeds its liabilities for long-term business by at
least the $250,000 minimum solvency margin. Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary
Authority is required if Bermuda Re’s dividend payments would reduce its prior
year-end total statutory capital by 15.0% or more.

Delaware law provides that an
insurance company which is a member of an insurance holding company system and is
domiciled in the state shall not pay dividends without giving prior notice to the
Insurance Commissioner of Delaware and may not pay dividends without the approval of the
Insurance Commissioner if the value of the proposed dividend, together with all other
dividends and distributions made in the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of
(1) 10% of statutory surplus or (2) net income, not including realized capital gains, each
as reported in the prior year’s statutory annual statement. In addition, no dividend
may be paid in excess of unassigned earned surplus. At December 31, 2005, Everest Re had
$232.8 million available for payment of dividends in 2006 without prior regulatory
approval.

B. Statutory Financial
Information

Everest Re prepares its statutory
financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) and the Delaware
Insurance Department. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in the NAIC
Accounting Practices and

F-35

Procedures Manual. The capital and statutory surplus of Everest
Re was $2,327.6 million (unaudited) and $2,093.2 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The statutory net loss of Everest Re was $26.9 million (unaudited) for the
year ended December 31, 2005 and the statutory net income was $175.8 million and $164.6
million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Bermuda Re prepares its statutory
financial statements in conformity with the accounting principles set forth in Bermuda in
The Insurance Act 1978, amendments thereto and related regulations. The statutory capital
and surplus of Bermuda Re was $1,521.3 million (unaudited) and $1,486.9 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The statutory net loss of Bermuda Re was $221.7
million (unaudited) for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the statutory net income was
$248.7 million and $128.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

15.    
          CONTINGENCIES

In the ordinary course of business,
the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute
resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the Company’s rights and
obligations under insurance, reinsurance and other contractual agreements. In some
disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds
owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others to collect
funds or enforce alleged rights. These disputes arise from time to time and as they arise
are addressed, and ultimately resolved, through both informal and formal means, including
negotiated resolution, arbitration and litigation. In all such matters, the Company
believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. While the final
outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe
that any of these matters, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position or liquidity. However, an adverse resolution of one
or more of these items in any one quarter or fiscal year could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s results of operations in that period.

In 1993 and prior, the Company had a
business arrangement with The Prudential wherein, for a fee, the Company accepted settled
claim payment obligations of certain property and casualty insurers, and, concurrently,
became the owner of the annuity or assignee of the annuity proceeds funded by the property
and casualty insurers specifically to fulfill these fully settled obligations. In these
circumstances, the Company would be liable if The Prudential, which has an A+ (Superior)
financial strength rating from A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), were unable to
make the annuity payments. The estimated cost to replace all such annuities for which the
Company was contingently liable at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $155.3 million and
$156.0 million, respectively.

Prior to its 1995 initial public
offering, the Company purchased annuities from an unaffiliated life insurance company with
an A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from A.M. Best to settle certain claim
liabilities of the Company. Should the life insurance company become unable to make the
annuity payments, the Company would be liable for those claim liabilities. The estimated
cost to replace such annuities at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $18.8 million and $17.4
million, respectively.

16.    
          SHARE BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company has a 2002 Stock
Incentive Plan (“2002 Employee Plan”), a 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (“1995
Employee Plan”), a 2003 Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Plan (“2003
Director Plan”), a 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (“1995
Director Plan”) and has awarded options to non-employee directors in Board actions in
2001, 2000 and 1999. In 2002, the Company implemented FAS No. 123, and related
interpretations in accounting for these plans and Board actions. Accordingly, option
compensation expense of $4.9 million, $3.3 million and $2.0 million have been recognized
in the accompanying consolidated

F-36

financial statements for years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, for stock options granted under the 2002 Employee Plan, the
1995 Employee Plan, the 2003 Director Plan and the 1995 Director Plan.

A summary of the status of the
Company’s shareholder approved and non-approved plans as of December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003 and changes during the years then ended is presented in the following table:

Compensation Plans
Approved by Shareholders:

Under the 2003 Director Plan, 500,000
common shares have been authorized to be granted as stock options or stock awards to
non-employee directors of the Company. At December 31, 2005 there were 477,500 remaining
shares available to be granted under the 2003 Director Plan. Under the 2002 Employee Plan
4,000,000 common shares have been authorized to be granted as stock options, stock awards
or restricted stock awards to officers and key employees of the Company. At December 31,
2005, there were 2,279,850 remaining shares available to be granted under the 2002
Employee Plan. Under the 1995 Director Plan, a total of 50,000 common shares have been
authorized to be granted as stock options to non-employee directors of the Company. At
December 31, 2005, there were 37,439 remaining shares available to be granted under the
1995 Director Plan. The 2002 Employee Plan replaced the 1995 Employee Plan; therefore, no
further awards will be granted under the 1995 Employee Plan.

Compensation Plans Not
Approved by Shareholders:

F-37

Compensation plans not approved by
shareholders refer to Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999, which awarded options to
non-employee directors. The Board actions were designed to award non-employee directors
with the options to purchase common stock to increase the ownership interest in the
Company of non-employee directors whose services are considered essential to the
Company’s continued progress, to align such interests with those of the shareholders
of the Company and to provide them with a further incentive to serve as directors to the
Company. Under Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999; 40,000, 30,000 and 26,000 common
shares have been granted as stock options to non-employee directors of the Company.

Options granted under the 2002
Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at the earlier of 20% per year over five
years or pro rata to the expiration of any applicable employment agreement, options
granted under the 1995 Director Plan vest at 50% per year over two years and options
granted under the 2003 Director Plan and the 2001, 2000 and 1999 Board actions vest at 33%
per year over three years. All options are exercisable at fair market value of the stock
at the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. Restricted shares
granted under the 2002 Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at the earlier of 20%
per year over five years or pro rata to the expiration of any applicable employment
agreement.

The following table summarizes
information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2005:

In addition to the 2002 Employee
Plan, the 1995 Employee Plan, the 2003 Director Plan and the 1995 Director Plan, Group
issued 1,962 common shares in 2005, 2,283 common shares in 2004 and 1,312 common shares in
2003 to the Company’s non-employee directors as compensation for their service as
directors in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These issuances had aggregate values of
$180,000, $185,000 and $100,000, respectively.

Since its 1995 initial public
offering, the Company has issued to certain key employees of the Company 310,000
restricted common shares, of which 19,960 restricted shares have been cancelled and to
non-employee directors of the company 10,000 restricted common shares, of which no
restricted shares have been cancelled. Upon issuance of restricted shares, unearned
compensation is charged to shareholders’ equity for the grant date market value of
the restricted shares and is amortized over the vesting period. The amount of earned
compensation recognized as expense with respect to restricted share awards was $3,091,263;
$1,316,224 and $382,835 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company acquired
10,645, 5,100 and 563 common shares at a cost of $1,035,631, $380,809 and $42,449 in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, from employees who chose to pay required withholding taxes
with shares exercised under the stock option grants or restricted shares, which became
unrestricted. The Company acquired 328 common shares at a cost of $32,905 in 2005 and 604
common shares at

F-38

a cost of $49,999 in 2003 from non-employee directors who chose to pay
the option exercise price with shares. Also in 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded
contributions of paid in capital in the amount of $5.6 million, $8.4 million and $3.5
million, respectively, representing the tax benefits attributable to the difference
between the amount of compensation expense deductible for tax purposes with respect to the
stock awards and the amount of such compensation expense reflected in the Company’s
financial statements.

17.    
          RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

During the normal course of business,
the Company, through its affiliates, engages in reinsurance and brokerage and commission
business transactions, which management believes to be at arm’s-length, with
companies controlled by or affiliated with its outside directors. Such transactions,
individually and in the aggregate, are not material to the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

18.    
          SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property
and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance
brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance
operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent
relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting
operation writes accident and health (“A&H”), marine, aviation and surety
business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies.
The International operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest
Re’s branches in Canada and Singapore, in addition to foreign business written
through Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation provides
reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to
life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office
and reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control. with respect to
pricing, risk management, monitoring aggregate exposures to catastrophe events, capital,
investments and support operations. Management generally monitors and evaluates the
financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results.
Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and
brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in
particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which,
respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting
expenses by earned premium. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance, but such
reinsurance generally does not impact segment results, as business is generally reported
within the segment in which the business was first produced. The accounting policies of
the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1K, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies.

The Company does not maintain
separate balance sheet data for its operating segments. Accordingly, the Company does not
review and evaluate the financial results of its operating segments based upon balance
sheet data.

Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re
sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re, a Bermuda insurance company and direct
subsidiary of Group. Business for this branch was previously included in the International
segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to the sale and in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information” (“FAS 131”), the Company restated
the International and Bermuda segments for the years ended December 31, 2003 to conform to
December 31, 2005 and 2004 segment reporting.

F-39

In 2003, Everest National, another
subsidiary of the Company, opened a regional office in California to better serve its
western U.S. Insurance business. The business produced through this additional office is
included in the U.S. Insurance operation.
