PART I

Unless otherwise indicated, all
financial data in this document have been prepared using generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America. As used in this document,
“Group” means Everest Re Group, Ltd. (formerly Everest Group, Ltd.);
“Holdings” means Everest Reinsurance Holdings, Inc.; “Everest Re”
means Everest Reinsurance Company and its subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise
requires); “Capital Trust” means Everest Re Capital Trust; and the
“Company” means Group and its subsidiaries, except when referring to periods
prior to February 24, 2000, when it means Holdings and its subsidiaries.

ITEM 1. Business

The Company

Group, a Bermuda company, with its
principal executive office in Barbados, was established in 1999 as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Holdings. On February 24, 2000, a corporate restructuring was completed and
Group became the new parent holding company of Holdings, which remains the holding company
for the Company’s U.S. based operations. Holders of shares of common stock of
Holdings automatically became holders of the same number of common shares of Group. Prior
to the restructuring, Group had no significant assets or capitalization and had not
engaged in any business or prior activities other than in connection with the
restructuring. The Company had gross written premiums in 2003 of $4.6 billion and
shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2003 of $3.2 billion.

In connection with the restructuring,
Group established a Bermuda-based reinsurance subsidiary, Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda),
Ltd. (“Bermuda Re”), which commenced business in the second half of 2000. Group
also formed Everest Global Services, Inc., a Delaware subsidiary, to perform
administrative and back-office functions for Group and its U.S.-based and non-U.S. based
subsidiaries.

Holdings, a Delaware corporation, was
established in 1993 to serve as the parent holding company of Everest Re, a Delaware
property and casualty reinsurer formed in 1973. Until October 6, 1995, Holdings was an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“The
Prudential”). On October 6, 1995, The Prudential sold its entire interest in the
shares of common stock of Holdings in an initial public offering (the “IPO”).

The Company’s principal
business, conducted through its operating subsidiaries, is the underwriting of reinsurance
and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and international markets. The Company underwrites
reinsurance both through brokers and directly with ceding companies, giving it the
flexibility to pursue business regardless of the ceding company’s preferred
reinsurance purchasing method. The Company underwrites insurance principally through
general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers. Group’s operating
subsidiaries, excluding Mt. McKinley Insurance Company (“Mt. McKinley”), which
is in run-off, and Everest International Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Everest
International”), which has limited business activity, are each rated A+
(“Superior”) by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), an independent
insurance industry rating organization that rates insurance companies on factors of
concern to policyholders.

Reinsurance Industry
Overview

Reinsurance is an arrangement in
which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance company,
the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the
ceding company under one or more insurance contracts. Reinsurance can provide a ceding
company with several benefits, including a reduction in net liability on individual or
classes of risks, catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses and assistance in
maintaining acceptable financial ratios. Reinsurance also provides a ceding company with
additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more
business than would be possible without a concomitant increase in capital and surplus.
Reinsurance, however, does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to
policyholders.

There are two basic types of
reinsurance arrangements: treaty and facultative reinsurance. In treaty reinsurance, the
ceding company is obligated to cede and the reinsurer is obligated to assume a specified
portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company. Treaty reinsurers do
not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties and,
consequently, after a review of the ceding company’s underwriting practices, are
largely dependent on the original risk underwriting decisions made by the ceding company.
In facultative reinsurance, the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part
of the risk under a single insurance contract. Facultative reinsurance is negotiated
separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance normally
is purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered by their reinsurance
treaties, for amounts in excess of the dollar limits of their reinsurance treaties and for
unusual risks.

Both treaty and facultative
reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis. Under
pro rata reinsurance, the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as
the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion. Under excess of loss reinsurance, the
reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and
expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount, known as the ceding company’s
retention or reinsurer’s attachment point, generally subject to a negotiated
reinsurance contract limit.


In pro rata reinsurance, the
reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission. The ceding commission
generally is based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the business being
reinsured (commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative
expense). Premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss
reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives
because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk. There is usually no ceding
commission on excess of loss reinsurance.

Reinsurers may purchase reinsurance
to cover their own risk exposure. Reinsurance of a reinsurer’s business is called a
retrocession. Reinsurance companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other
reinsurers, known as retrocessionaires, for reasons similar to those that cause insurers
to purchase reinsurance: to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks,
protect against catastrophic losses, stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional
underwriting capacity.

Reinsurance can be written through
intermediaries, generally professional reinsurance brokers, or directly with ceding
companies. From a ceding company’s perspective, both the broker and the direct
distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages. A ceding company’s decision
to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of
such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed.

Business Strategy

The Company’s underwriting
strategies seek to capitalize on its financial strength and capacity, its employee
expertise and its flexibility to offer multiple products through multiple distribution
channels. The Company’s strategies include effective management of the property and
casualty underwriting cycle, which refers to the tendency of insurance premiums, profits
and the demand for and availability of coverage to rise and fall over time. The Company
also seeks to manage its catastrophe exposures and retrocessional costs. Efforts to
control expenses and to operate in a cost-efficient manner are also a continuing focus for
the Company.


The Company’s products include:
(1) the full range of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance coverages, including
marine, aviation, surety, errors and omissions liability (“E&O”),
directors’ and officers’ liability (“D&O”), medical malpractice,
other specialty lines, accident and health (“A&H”), workers’
compensation and (2) reinsurance of life and annuity business. The Company’s product
distribution includes direct and broker reinsurance channels; U.S., Bermuda and
international markets; treaty and facultative reinsurance and admitted and non-admitted
insurance.

The Company’s underwriting
strategy emphasizes underwriting profitability rather than premium volume, writing
specialized property and casualty risks and integration of underwriting expertise across
all underwriting units. Key elements of this strategy are prudent risk selection,
appropriate pricing through strict underwriting discipline and continuous adjustment of
the Company’s business mix to respond to changing market conditions. The Company
focuses on reinsuring companies that effectively manage the underwriting cycle through
proper analysis and pricing of underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and
performance are compatible with its objectives.

The Company’s underwriting
strategy also emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions,
such as increased demand or favorable pricing trends. The Company believes that its
existing strengths, including its broad underwriting expertise, U.S., Bermuda and
international presence, strong financial ratings and substantial capital, facilitate
adjustments to its mix of business geographically, by line of business and by type of
coverage, allowing it to capitalize on those market opportunities that provide the
greatest potential for underwriting profitability. The Company’s insurance operations
complement these strategies by allowing the Company access to business that would not
likely be available to it on a reinsurance basis. The Company carefully monitors its mix
of business across all operations to avoid inappropriate concentrations of geographic or
other risk.

Marketing

The Company writes business on a
worldwide basis for many different customers and for many lines of business, providing a
broad array of coverages. The Company is not materially dependent on any single customer,
small group of customers, line of business or geographical area. For the 2003 calendar
year, no single customer (ceding company or insured) generated more than 6.8% of the
Company’s gross written premiums. The Company does not believe that a reduction of
business from any one customer would have a material adverse effect on its future
financial condition or results of operations due to the Company’s competitive
position in the marketplace and the continuing availability of other sources of business.

Approximately 59.0%, 15.7% and 25.3%
of the Company’s 2003 gross written premiums were written in the broker reinsurance,
direct reinsurance and insurance markets, respectively. The Company’s ability to
write reinsurance both through brokers and directly with ceding companies gives it the
flexibility to pursue business regardless of the ceding company’s preferred
reinsurance purchasing method.

The reinsurance broker market
consists of several substantial national and international brokers and a number of smaller
specialized brokers. Brokers do not have the authority to bind the Company with respect to
reinsurance agreements, nor does the Company commit in advance to accept any portion of
the business that brokers submit to it. Reinsurance business from any ceding company,
whether new or renewal, is subject to acceptance by the Company. Brokerage fees are
generally paid by reinsurers. The Company’s ten largest brokers accounted for an
aggregate of approximately 49.5% of gross written premiums in 2003, with the two largest
brokers accounting for approximately 17.4% (Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.) and
14.2% (AON Risk Services) of gross written premiums, respectively. The Company does not
believe that a reduction of business assumed from any one broker would have a materially
adverse effect on the Company due to its competitive position in the market place,
relationships with ceding companies and the continuing availability of other sources of
business.

The direct market remains an
important distribution system for reinsurance business written by the Company. Direct
placement of reinsurance enables the Company to access clients who prefer to place their
reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon the reinsurer’s in-depth
understanding of the ceding company’s needs. The Company’s insurance business is
written principally through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers. The
Company’s largest agency relationship American All-Risk Services, LLC, accounted for
approximately 12.7% of gross written premiums, which consists of approximately 24,000
individual workers’ compensation policies.

The Company continually evaluates
each business relationship, including the underwriting expertise and experience of each
distribution channel selected, performs analyses to evaluate financial security, monitors
performance and adjusts underwriting decisions accordingly.


Segment Information

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property
and casualty reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis through reinsurance
brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S.  The U.S. Insurance
operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent
relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S.  The Specialty Underwriting
operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and
worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation
writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re’s branches in London,
Canada and Singapore, in addition to foreign business written through the Company’s
Miami and New Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation writes property, casualty, life and
annuity business through brokers and directly with ceding companies.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, including with
respect to capital, investments and support operations. As a result, management monitors
and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments principally based upon
their underwriting results. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance but such
reinsurance does not impact segment results, since business is generally reported within
the segment in which the business was first produced. For selected financial information
regarding these segments, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has recently announced
that one of its subsidiaries, Everest Re, has reached agreement, subject to regulatory
approval, to sell its United Kingdom branch to another of the Company’s subsidiaries,
Bermuda Re. Business for this branch is currently reported through the International
segment; however, upon completion of the transaction, the business of this branch will be
included in the Bermuda segment. Appropriate disclosures will be made in future filings to
address the segment financial result fluctuations caused by the transfer.

The Company has also recently
announced that another subsidiary, Everest National, has opened a regional office in
California to better serve its western U.S. Insurance business. The additional office will
not affect segment reporting.

Underwriting Operations

The following table presents the
distribution of the Company’s gross written premiums by its U.S. Reinsurance, U.S.
Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda operations for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000, and 1999, classified according to whether the
premium is derived from property or casualty business and, for reinsurance business,
whether it represents pro rata or excess of loss business:

(1) For purposes of the presentation above, pro rata includes reinsurance attaching
          to the first dollar of loss incurred by the ceding company and insurance.

(2) Certain totals and subtotals may not reconcile due to rounding.

(3) Includes
          immaterial amounts of life and annuity premium.

U.S.    
          Reinsurance Operation.

The Company’s U.S. Reinsurance operation writes
          property and casualty reinsurance, both treaty and facultative, through
          reinsurance brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S.
          The Company targets certain brokers and, through the broker market, specialty
          companies and small to medium sized standard lines companies. On a direct basis,
          the Company targets companies that place their business predominantly in the
          direct market, including small to medium sized regional ceding companies, and
          seeks to develop long-term relationships with those companies. In addition, the
          U.S. Reinsurance operation writes portions of reinsurance programs for larger,
          national insurance companies.


In 2003, $484.7 million of gross
written premiums were attributable to U.S. treaty property business, of which 26.2% was
written on an excess of loss basis and 73.8% was written on a pro rata basis. The Company’s
property underwriters utilize sophisticated underwriting methods which management
believes are necessary to analyze and price property business, particularly that segment
of the property market which has catastrophe exposure.

U.S. treaty casualty business
accounted for $959.3 million of gross written premiums in 2003, of which 34.8% was
written on an excess of loss basis and 65.2% was written on a pro rata basis. The treaty
casualty portfolio consists of professional liability, D&O liability, workers’ compensation,
excess and surplus lines and other liability coverages. As a result of the complex
technical nature of most of these risks, the Company’s casualty underwriters tend to
specialize by line of business and work closely with the Company’s pricing
actuaries.

The Company’s facultative unit
conducts business both through brokers and directly with ceding companies, and consists of
four underwriting units representing property, casualty, specialty and national brokerage
lines of business. Business is written from a facultative headquarters office in New York
and satellite offices in Chicago and Oakland. In 2003, $80.7 million, $167.2 million,
$27.0 million and $33.4 million of gross written premiums were attributable to the
property, casualty, specialty and national brokerage lines of business, respectively.

In 2003, 86.0% and 14.0% of the U.S.
Reinsurance operation’s gross written premiums were written in the broker and direct
reinsurance markets, respectively.

U.S.    
          Insurance Operation.

In 2003, the Company’s U.S. Insurance operation
          wrote $1,069.5 million of gross premiums, of which 96.0% was casualty,
          predominantly workers’ compensation insurance, and 4.0% was property. Of
          the total business written, Everest National wrote $876.5 million and Everest Re
          wrote $13.8 million, with both principally targeting commercial property and
          casualty business written through general agency relationships with program
          administrators. Everest Indemnity wrote $152.8 million, principally targeting
          excess and surplus lines insurance business written through surplus lines
          brokers. Everest Security wrote $26.4 million, principally targeting
          non-standard auto business written through retail agency relationships. With
          respect to insurance written through general agents and surplus lines brokers,
          the Company supplements the initial underwriting process with periodic claims,
          underwriting and operational reviews and ongoing monitoring.

Specialty Underwriting
Operation.

The Company’s Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine,
aviation and surety reinsurance. The A&H unit primarily focuses on health reinsurance
of traditional indemnity plans, self-insured health plans, accident coverages and
specialty medical plans. The marine and aviation unit focuses on ceding companies with a
particular expertise in marine and aviation business. The marine and aviation business is
written primarily through brokers and contains a significant international component
written primarily in the London market. Surety business underwritten by the Company
consists mainly of reinsurance of contract surety bonds.

Gross written premiums by the A&H
unit in 2003 totaled $352.3 million, of which 39.3% was written through the broker market
and 60.7% was written through the direct market.

Gross written premiums by the marine
and aviation unit in 2003 totaled $75.1 million, substantially all of which was written on
a treaty basis and 95.6% of which was sourced through reinsurance brokers. Marine treaties
represented 44.2% of marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2003 and consisted
mainly of hull and liability coverage. Approximately 27.1% of the marine unit premiums in
2003 were written on a pro rata basis and 72.9% as excess of loss. Aviation premiums
accounted for 55.8% of marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2003 and included
reinsurance for airlines and general aviation. Approximately 67.2% of the aviation
unit’s premiums in 2003 were written on a pro rata basis and 32.8% as excess of loss.


In 2003, gross written premiums by
the surety unit totaled $75.5 million. Approximately 79.9% of the surety unit premiums in
2003 were written on a pro rata basis and 20.1% on an excess of loss basis. Most of the
portfolio is reinsurance of contract surety bonds written directly with ceding companies,
with the remainder being credit reinsurance, mostly in international markets.

International Operation.

The
Company’s International operation is designed to enable it to capitalize on the
growth opportunities in the international reinsurance markets. The Company targets several
international markets, including: Europe and the London markets, which are serviced by a
branch in London, (which has been sold to Bermuda Re subject to required regulatory
approval); Canada, with a branch in Toronto; Asia, with a branch in Singapore; and Latin
America, Africa and the Middle East, which business is serviced from Everest Re’s
Miami and New Jersey offices. The Company also writes “home-foreign” business,
which provides reinsurance on the international portfolios of U.S. insurers, from New
Jersey. Approximately 71.6% of the gross written premiums by the Company’s
international underwriters in 2003 represented property business, while 28.4% represented
casualty business. As with its U.S. operations, the Company’s International operation
focuses on financially sound companies that have strong management and underwriting
discipline and expertise. Approximately 76.0% of the Company’s international business
was written through brokers, with 24.0% written directly with ceding companies.

In 2003, the Company’s gross
written premiums by its London branch totaled $443.5 million and consisted of pro rata
property (32.3%), excess property (22.6%), pro rata casualty (31.9%) and excess casualty
(13.2%). Substantially all of the London premiums consisted of treaty reinsurance.

Gross written premiums by the
Company’s Canadian office totaled $141.4 million in 2003 and consisted of pro rata
property (52.0%), excess property (19.8%), pro rata multi-line (4.1%) and excess casualty
(24.1%). Approximately 75.2% of the Canadian premiums consisted of treaty reinsurance,
while 24.8% was facultative reinsurance.

The Company’s Singapore branch
covers the Asian markets and accounted for $44.9 million of gross written premiums in
2003. This business consisted of pro rata property (50.4%), excess property (36.4%), pro
rata casualty (12.1%) and excess casualty (1.1%).

International business written out of
Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices accounted for $334.5 million of gross
written premiums in 2003 and consisted of pro rata treaty property (69.4%), pro rata
treaty casualty (6.0%), excess treaty property (13.7%), excess treaty casualty (2.2%) and
excess facultative property and casualty (8.7%). Of this international business, 66.6% was
sourced from Latin America, 22.3% was sourced from the Middle East, 8.9% was sourced from
Africa and 2.2% was “home-foreign” business.

Bermuda Operation.

The
Company’s Bermuda operation writes property, casualty, life and annuity business
through Bermuda Re. In 2003, the Bermuda operation continued to scale up and had gross
property and casualty written premiums of $284.8 million, of which $145.6 million or 51.1%
was facultative reinsurance or individual risk insurance and $139.2 million or 48.9% was
treaty reinsurance.

The Company offers ceding companies
full service capability, including actuarial, claims, accounting and systems support,
either directly or through the broker community. The Company’s capacity for both
property and casualty risks allows it to underwrite entire contracts or major portions
thereof that might otherwise need to be syndicated among several reinsurers. The
Company’s strategy is to act as “lead” reinsurer in many of the reinsurance
treaties it underwrites. The lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the
largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in a stronger position to negotiate price,
terms and conditions than is a reinsurer that takes a smaller position. Management
believes this strategy enables it to more effectively influence the terms and conditions
of the treaties on which it participates. When the Company does not lead the treaty, it
may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty. The Company may decline to
participate in a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant factors.

The Company’s treaty
underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among the Company’s underwriters,
actuaries and claim staff. Treaties are reviewed for compliance with the Company’s
general underwriting standards and certain larger treaties are evaluated in part based
upon actuarial analyses by the Company. The actuarial models used in such analyses are
tailored in each case to the exposures and experience underlying the specific treaty and
the loss experience for the risks covered by such treaties. The Company does not
separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties. The Company
does, however, generally evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to
determine their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty. The Company, when appropriate,
also conducts underwriting, operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding
companies to ensure that the ceding companies operate within such guidelines. Underwriting
audits focus on the quality of the underwriting staff, the selection and pricing of risks
and the capability of monitoring price levels over time. Claim audits, when appropriate,
are performed in order to evaluate the client’s claims handling abilities and
practices.

The Company’s facultative
underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks, limits and
maximum risk exposures. Specified classes of U.S. risks and large premium risks are
referred to Everest Re’s New York facultative headquarters for specific review before
premium quotations are given to clients. In addition, the Company’s guidelines
require certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate
limits, complexity or volatility, regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract.
Non-U.S. risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within
the involved operations.

The Company’s insurance
operations principally write property and casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through
select program managers. These programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and
the program manager’s capabilities. The Company’s rates, forms and underwriting
guidelines are tailored to specific risk types. The Company’s underwriting,
actuarial, claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to
establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate
monitoring mechanisms.


Risk Management and
Retrocession Arrangements

The Company manages its risk of loss
through a combination of aggregate exposure limits, underwriting guidelines that take into
account risks, prices and coverage, and retrocessional arrangements.

The Company is exposed to multiple
insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a
hurricane or an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory.
Any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one, several or many of the
Company’s treaties or lines of business, including property and/or casualty
exposures. The Company employs various techniques, including licensed software modeling,
to assess its accumulated exposure. Such techniques are inherently more difficult to apply
to non-property exposures. Accumulated exposures with respect to catastrophe losses are
generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss (“PML”). The Company
defines PML as its anticipated maximum loss, taking into account contract limits, caused
by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused
by a hurricane or earthquake, of such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in
every 100 years.

Management believes that the
Company’s greatest catastrophe exposure world wide from any single event is to a
European windstorm where the Company estimates it has a pre-tax PML exposure of $430
million. The Company further estimates that its greatest pre-tax U.S. PML exposure, which relates to an earthquake affecting the west coast including workers’ compensation exposure is $404 million. The second largest U.S.
exposure relates to a hurricane affecting the east coast with a PML of $302 million. There
can be no assurance that the Company will not experience losses from one or more
catastrophic events that exceed, perhaps by a substantial amount, its estimated PML.

The U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act
of 2002 was signed into law in November 2002. This legislation provides Federal
reimbursement of 90% of insured losses, in excess of statutory retention levels, due to
acts of terrorism carried out by foreign powers on U.S. soil or against U.S. air carriers,
vessels or foreign missions. This coverage does not apply to reinsurance. Reinsurance
contracts generally exclude losses arising from terrorist events, except where such
coverage has been specifically included in the underwriting and pricing of the involved
reinsurance. The Company does not believe that this legislation has had a significant
impact on its operations.

Underwriting guidelines have been
established for each business unit. These guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of
business that can be written based on a variety of factors, including ceding company, line
of business, geographical location and risk hazards. In each case, those guidelines permit
limited exceptions, which must be authorized by the Company’s senior management.

The Company employs a retrocessional
approach under which the Company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business
written or exposure accumulations or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering
the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the
Company’s operations. All reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the
potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing, terms, conditions
and availability of such coverage, with the aim of securing cost-effective protection. The
level of reinsurance coverage varies over time, reflecting the underwriter’s and/or
Company’s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the
reinsurance markets.


The Company does not typically
purchase significant amounts of reinsurance to cover specific reinsurance business
written, but it does from time to time purchase retrocessional protections where
underwriting management deems it to be prudent and/or cost-effective to reinsure a portion
of the specific risks being assumed. The Company purchased an excess property facultative
retrocessional program in 2002 and 2001 as well as an excess workers’ compensation
retrocessional program in 2001. In addition, the Company purchased an excess property
catastrophe retrocessional program for losses incurred outside of the U.S. in 2002 and
2001. The 2002 program, which expired on June 5, 2003, was not renewed. The Company also
participates in “common account” retrocessional arrangements for certain
reinsurance treaties. Common account reinsurance arrangements are arrangements whereby the
ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers on one
or more of its reinsurance treaties. Common account retrocessional arrangements reduce the
effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies, including the
ceding company, with respect to the involved treaties.

The Company typically considers the
purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance programs written by the U.S. Insurance
operation. Such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the
availability of cost-effective reinsurance protection. For policies incepting during or
after November 1998, the Company purchased a workers’ compensation reinsurance
program that provided for statutory limits coverage in excess of $75,000 of losses per
occurrence on the Company’s workers’ compensation insurance business written
prior to November 1, 2000. Effective November 2000, this primary workers’
compensation reinsurance program provided statutory limits coverage in excess of $250,000
of losses per occurrence for business written prior to December 31, 2001. The Company has
not purchased such coverage for the period subsequent to December 31, 2001. In addition,
for the twelve-month period commencing July 31, 2000, the Company purchased reinsurance
for a specific program of business. The reinsurance, subject to certain aggregate limits,
covered U.S. Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act and state act
workers’ compensation business for 100% of loss occurrences up to $100 million.
Consistent with the $1 million limits of the underlying policies in the program,
reinsurance for 100% of Maritime Employers Liability and Employers Liability was also
provided. This program was not renewed after its 2001 expiration.

The Company also considers purchasing
corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of
exposures. Such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the
availability of cost-effective retrocessional protection. For years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss
retrocession coverage that provided up to $175.0 million of coverage for each year. These
excess of loss policies provided coverage if Everest Re’s consolidated statutory
basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment point for each year of
coverage. The attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included adjustable
premium provisions that effectively caused the Company to offset, on a pre-tax income
basis, up to approximately 57% of such ceded losses. The maximum recovery for each year is
$175.0 million before giving effect to the adjustable premium. As of December 31, 2003,
the Company has ceded the maximum limits under all three contracts. The Company did not
purchase similar coverage subsequent to December 31, 2001.

Although certain of the
Company’s catastrophe and aggregate excess of loss retrocessions have terms which
provide for additional premiums to be paid to the retrocessionaire in the event that
losses are ceded, all aspects of the Company’s retrocessional program have been
structured to permit these agreements to be accounted for as reinsurance under Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance
of Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts”.


If a single catastrophe were to occur
that resulted in $430 million of gross losses and loss adjustment expenses
(“LAE”) in 2004 (an amount equivalent to the Company’s PML), management
estimates that the effect on the Company’s income would be approximately $430 million
and $335 million before and after taxes, respectively. There can be no assurance that the
Company will not experience one or more catastrophic events that could cause these
estimates to be exceeded, perhaps by a substantial amount.

In connection with the Company’s
acquisition of Mt. McKinley in September 2000, the Company had coverage under an aggregate
excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by Prudential Property and Casualty
Insurance Company of Indiana (“Prupac”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Prudential. This agreement covers 80% or $160 million of the first $200 million of any
adverse loss reserve development on the carried reserves of Mt. McKinley at the date of
acquisition and reimburses the Company as such losses are paid by the Company. Cessions
under this reinsurance were $81 million, $57 million and $22 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, exhausting the limit available under the
contract at December 31, 2003.

Also in connection with the Mt.
McKinley acquisition, Prupac provided excess of loss reinsurance for 100% of the first
$8.5 million of loss with respect to certain of Mt. McKinley’s retrocessions and
potentially uncollectible reinsurance coverage. There were no cessions under this
reinsurance during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, maintaining the limit
available under the contract at $2.4 million. There was $3.6 million of cessions under
this reinsurance for the year ended December 31, 2001.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company
carried as an asset $1,284.1 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses
ceded. Of this amount, $494.5 million, or 38.5%, was receivable from subsidiaries of
London Reinsurance Group (“London Life”), $160.0 million, or 12.5%, was
receivable from Prupac and $145.0 million, or 11.3%, was receivable from Continental
Insurance Company (“Continental”) and $96.7 million, or 7.5% was receivable from Tranatlantic Reinsurance Company. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more
than 5% of the Company’s receivables. See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial
Condition”.

The Company’s arrangements with
both London Life and Continental are managed on a funds held basis, which means that the
Company has not released premium payments to the retrocessionaire but rather retains such
payments to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire, records them as a liability,
credits interest on the balances and reduces the liability account as payments become due.
As of December 31, 2003, such funds had reduced the Company’s net exposure to
London Life to $204.9 million, effectively 100% of which has been secured by letters of
credit, and its exposure to Continental to $53.3 million. Prupac’s obligations are
guaranteed by The Prudential.

No assurance can be given that the
Company will seek or be able to obtain retrocessional coverage in the future similar to
that in place currently or in the past. The Company continuously evaluates its exposures
and risk capacities in the context of reinsurance market conditions, at both the specific
and corporate level. Although management carefully selects its reinsurers, the Company is
subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to
reinsurers does not relieve the Company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies.


Mt. McKinley - Acquisition

The Company completed its acquisition
of Gibraltar, subsequently renamed Mt. McKinley, in September 2000. In connection with the
acquisition, the seller provided the reinsurance described above and the Company
terminated certain relationships between Mt. McKinley and its former parent, The
Prudential, and its affiliates. Mt. McKinley’s ongoing operations relate to servicing
claims arising from (1) insurance written by Mt. McKinley or Everest Re prior to 1985, (2)
reinsurance of insurance business and certain Everest Re reinsurance business written
prior to 1991 which had previously been reinsured with third parties and commuted with
those third parties into Mt. McKinley and (3) exposure to adverse loss reserve development
on Everest Re’s reserves as of June 30, 1995, which exposure was assumed by Mt.
McKinley at the time of the Company’s initial public offering. Effective September
19, 2000, Mt. McKinley and Bermuda Re entered into a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance
agreement, whereby Mt. McKinley transferred, for what management believes to be
arm’s-length consideration, all of its net insurance exposures and reserves to
Bermuda Re.

Claims

Reinsurance claims are managed by the
Company’s professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial
loss reports and coverage issues, monitoring claims handling activities of ceding
companies, establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of
claims. In addition to claims assessment, processing and payment, the claims staff
selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim
procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies. Insurance claims, except those
relating to Mt. McKinley’s business, are generally handled by third party claims
services providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the
Company’s professional claims staff.

The Company intensively manages its
asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) exposures through dedicated, centrally
managed claim staffs for Mt. McKinley and Everest Re. Both are staffed with experienced
claim and legal professionals that specialize in the handling of such exposures. These
units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account, responding to claim
developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves as
appropriate. Specific or general claim developments that may have material implications
for the Company are regularly communicated to senior management, actuarial, legal and
financial areas. Meetings among these areas, claim management and senior management are
held at least quarterly to review the Company’s overall reserve positions and make
changes, if appropriate. The Company continually reviews its internal processing,
communications and analytics, seeking to enhance the management of it’s A&E
exposures, in particular in the context of changes in the landscape of asbestos claims and
litigation.

Reserves for Unpaid
Property and Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Significant periods of time may
elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the insurer
and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to
the insurer by the reinsurer. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and LAE, insurers
and reinsurers establish reserves, which are balance sheet liabilities representing
estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related
expenses on losses that have already occurred. Actual losses and LAE paid may deviate,
perhaps substantially, from such reserves. To the extent reserves prove to be insufficient
to cover actual losses and LAE after taking into account available reinsurance coverage,
the Company would have to augment such reserves and incur a charge to earnings, which
could be material in the period such augmentation takes place. See ITEM 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Loss and LAE Reserves”.


While the reserving process is
difficult and subjective for insurance companies, the inherent uncertainties of estimating
such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer, due primarily to the longer time between
the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer, the
diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or
facultative contracts, the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information
regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies. In
addition, trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not
necessarily occur or affect liability development to the same degree in the future. As a
result, actual losses and LAE may deviate, perhaps substantially, from estimates of
reserves reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Like many other property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company has experienced adverse loss development
for prior accident years, which has led to adjustments in losses and LAE reserves. The
increase in net reserves for prior accident years reduced net income for the periods in
which the adjustments were made. There can be no assurance that adverse development from
prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have
a material adverse effect on net income.

Changes in Historical
Reserves

The following table shows changes in
historical loss reserves for the Company for 1993 and subsequent years. The table is
presented on a GAAP basis except that the Company’s loss reserves for its Canadian
branch operations are presented in Canadian dollars, the impact of which is not material.
The top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and LAE recorded
at each year end date. Each amount in the top line represents the estimated amount of
future payments for losses and LAE on claims occurring in that year and in all prior
years. The upper (paid) portion of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid through
each subsequent year on those claims for which reserves were carried as of each specific
year end. The lower (liability re-estimated) portion shows the re-estimated amount of the
previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year.
The reserve estimates change as more information becomes known about the actual claims for
which the initial reserves were carried. The cumulative redundancy/deficiency line
represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established.
It is equal to the latest liability re-estimated amount less the initial reserve.

Each amount other than the original
reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts
for prior periods. For example, if a loss settled in 1996 for $100,000 was first reserved
in 1993 at $60,000 and remained unchanged until settlement, the $40,000 deficiency (actual
loss minus original estimate) would be included in the cumulative redundancy (deficiency)
in each of the years in the period 1993 through 1995 shown below. Conditions and trends
that have affected development of liability in the past are not indicative of future
developments. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or
deficiencies based on this table.

Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table
Presented Net of Reinsurance with Supplemental Gross Data (1) (2) (3)

(1) Includes $480.9 million relating
to Mt. McKinley at December 31, 2000, principally reflecting $491.1 million of
Mt. McKinley reserves at the acquisition date.

(2) The Canadian
Branch reserves are reflected in Canadian dollars.

(3) Some totals may not
reconcile due to rounding.


The most recent five years on the
above table reflect cumulative deficiencies, also referred to as adverse development, with
the largest indicated deficiency in 2001. Three active classes of business are the
principal contributors to those deficiencies: professional liability reinsurance, general
casualty reinsurance and workers’ compensation insurance. In addition to these active
business classes, there continues to be adverse experience on A&E reserves.

In the professional liability
reinsurance class, the late 1990s and early 2000s saw a proliferation of claims relating
to bankruptcies and other corporate, financial and/or management improprieties. This
resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims on the professional
liability policies reinsured by the Company. In the general casualty area, the Company
continues to experience claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the
Company’s pricing and reserving assumptions, particularly for accident years 1998
through 2001. These losses reflect unfavorable trends in litigation and economic
variability. With respect to both of these classes, another factor was the increasingly
competitive conditions in insurance and reinsurance markets during this period. While the
Company seeks to manage the impact of competitive condition changes on its results, it is
generally unable to divorce itself entirely from the underlying industry cycles of its
principal business. See ITEM 1, “Business – Competition”.

In the workers’ compensation
insurance class, the majority of which was written in California, the Company has
experienced adverse development primarily for accident years 2001 and 2002. As a result of
significant growth in this book of business in a challenging business environment, the
Company’s writings in this class were relatively more subject to variability than are
some of its more established and/or stable lines of business. Although cumulative results
through 2003 continue to be profitable for this book of business, there has been some
deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002,
which the Company generally attributes to the growth of this portfolio of business.

With respect to active business
classes, the Company actively manages the collection, auditing and analysis of loss data
and factors the resulting information into both its reserving processes and its
prospective underwriting and pricing activities on as timely a basis as possible.

For years 1994 and prior, management
believes that two factors had the most significant impact on loss development. First,
through the 1980s, a number of industry and external factors, such as the propensity of
courts to award large damage awards in liability cases, combined to increase loss
frequency and severity to unexpectedly high levels. Second, contracts written prior to
1986 contained coverage terms which, for the Company and the industry in general, have
been interpreted by courts to provide coverage for A&E exposures not contemplated by
either the pricing or the initial reserving of the contracts. Legal developments during
the 1980s and continuing to date have necessitated additional reserving for such exposures
on both a case basis and an incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) basis. These
factors were the primary reasons for the cumulative adverse development on the 1994 and
1993 calendar year reserves. See ITEM 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies –
Asbestos and Environmental Exposures”.

The change between 1994 and 1995
reflects the impact of a stop loss reinsurance agreement with Mt. McKinley, which was then
a subsidiary of The Prudential. This stop loss agreement commenced in 1995 when The
Prudential sold the stock of the Company in an initial public offering and hence
recoveries under this coverage are attributed to the 1995 accident year. As a result of
this agreement, reserve development arising from claims incurred prior to July 1, 1995
(January 1, 1995 as respects catastrophe losses) was ceded under the agreement with no
impact on net development, except for a modest retention, when the adverse development
reflected for accident year 1993 and prior is considered in the context of the mitigating
favorable development attributed to the 1995 accident year. This coverage became an
inter-affiliate reinsurance transaction with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley in 2000,
which eliminated any subsequent impact on net reserve development.


Management believes that adequate
provision has been made for the Company’s loss and LAE reserves. While there can be
no assurance that reserves for and losses from these claims will not increase in the
future, management believes that the Company’s existing reserves, reserving
methodologies and retrocessional arrangements lessen the probability that any such
increases would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. These statements regarding the Company’s loss
reserves are forward looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities
laws and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein. See
ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations – Safe Harbor Disclosure”.

The following table is derived from
the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table above and summarizes the effect of reserve
re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations by accident year for the
same ten year period ended December 31, 2003. Each column represents the amount of reserve
re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the
re-estimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far
right represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates for the indicated accident years.

The reserve development by accident
year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors discussed
above that caused the deficiencies shown in the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table.
Development in accident years 1993 and prior principally reflect the impact of A&E
exposures discussed above. The favorable development experienced for the 1995 accident
year is due to stop loss reinsurance provided to the Company at the time of its initial
public offering, which, when established, was specifically intended to mitigate the impact
of development on reserves at June 30, 1995. The adverse development experienced in the
1998 through 2001 accident years relates principally to casualty reinsurance, including
professional liability classes and workers’ compensation insurance where, in
retrospect, the Company’s initial estimates of losses were underestimated principally
as the result of unanticipated variability in the underlying exposures.

The favorable development for
accident year 2002 relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property
reinsurance business.

The Company’s loss reserving
methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends,
seeking, on a timely basis, to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to
factor the impact of such shifts into its underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis.

The following table presents a
reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve balances for the years indicated on a GAAP
basis:

Reconciliation of
Reserves for Losses and LAE


Prior year incurred losses were
$256.9 million in 2003 and $140.1 million in 2002. Such losses were the result of the
reserve development noted above, as well as inherent uncertainty in establishing loss and
LAE reserves.

Reserves for Asbestos and
Environmental Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

The Company’s reserves include
an estimate of the Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims for which ultimate
value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. There are significant
uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E
claims. See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations – Asbestos and Environmental Exposures” and Note 3 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mt.    
          McKinley’s book of direct A&E exposed insurance is relatively small and homogenous.  The book is based, principally on excess liability
          policies; thus the claim/legal staff does not have to analyze exposure under
          many different policy forms, but rather can focus on a limited number of
          policies and policy forms. As a result of this focused structure, the Company
          believes that it is able to comprehensively analyze its exposures, allowing it
          to identify and analyze those claims on which it has unusual exposure, such as
          policies in which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits
          or non-products asbestos claims, for concentrated ongoing attention.

The Company aims to be actively
engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to Mt.
McKinley. Such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement, negotiation,
litigation, or the monitoring of claim activity under Coverage in Place (“CIP”)
agreements. CIP agreements generally condition an insurer’s payment upon the actual
claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to
control the insurer’s payments. The Company’s Mt. McKinley operation is
currently managing six CIP agreements, five of which were executed prior to the
acquisition of Mt. McKinley in 2000. The Company’s preference with respect to
coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments,
because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty.

The Company has significantly
enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics, as well as its
analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active. Those insureds
identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous, but still
active management, with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics, which may
indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity. The Company continually focuses on
further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential
exposure of policyholders, including those that may not have reported significant A&E
losses.

reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of A&E exposed
relationships. Because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the Company has
been managing the A&E exposures for many years, its claim staff is familiar with the
ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are
therefore most likely to generate future liabilities. The Company’s claim staff has
developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies
and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies. This level of
familiarity enhances the quality of the Company’s analysis of its exposure through
those companies. As a result, the Company believes that it can identify those claims on
which it has unusual exposure, such as non-products asbestos claims, for concentrated
attention. However, in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities, the Company
relies on claims data supplied by its ceding companies and brokers. This information is
not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of ultimate loss
projections.

The following table summarizes the
composition of the Company’s total reserves for A&E losses, gross and net of
reinsurance, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Additional losses, including those
relating to latent injuries and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type
or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the Company or the industry, may emerge
in the future. Such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the
Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Future Policy Benefit
Reserves

Future policy benefit liabilities for
annuities are reported at the accumulated fund balance of these contracts. Reserves for
those liabilities include both mortality and morbidity provisions with respect to life and
annuity claims, both reported and unreported. Actual experience in a particular period may
be worse than assumed experience and, consequently, may adversely affect the
Company’s operating results for the period. See Note 1F of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Investments

The Company’s overall financial
strength and results of operations are, in part, dependent on the quality and performance
of its investment portfolio. Net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses)
on the Company’s invested assets constituted 8.9%, 11.8%, and 17.7% of the
Company’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The Company’s cash and invested assets totaled $9.3 billion at December
31, 2003, of which 91.8% were cash, short-term investments and investment-grade fixed
maturities.

The Company’s current investment
strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income, through a high quality, diversified, taxable
bond and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of
liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted
continuously, consistent with the Company’s current and projected operating results,
market conditions and tax position. Additionally, the Company invests in equity
securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the
investment portfolio.

The board of directors of each of the
Company’s operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy
and guidelines and, together with senior management, for overseeing their execution. The
Company’s investment portfolio is in compliance with the insurance laws of the
jurisdictions in which its subsidiaries are regulated. Generally, an independent
investment advisor is utilized to manage the Company’s investment portfolio within
the established guidelines and is required to report activities on a current basis and to
meet with the Company periodically to review and discuss the portfolio structure,
securities selection and performance results.


The Company’s investment
guidelines include a general duration guideline of five to six years. The duration of an
investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of
interest and the possibility of early prepayment of such security. This investment
duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management, which considers
economic and business factors. An important factor considered by management is the
Company’s average duration of potential liabilities, which, at December 31, 2003, is
estimated at approximately five years based on the estimated payouts of underwriting
liabilities using standard duration calculations.

The duration of the fixed income
portfolio at December 31, 2003 was 4.2 years compared with the general guideline of five
to six years. The Company made a decision to shorten the duration during the second half
of 2003 by purchasing interest only strips of mortgaged-back securities (“interest
only strips”). The interest only strips give the holder the right to receive interest
payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments
on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate
cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the
underlying mortgage pool. Generally, as market interest rates and more specifically market
mortgage rates decline, mortgagees tend to refinance, which will decrease the average life
of a mortgage pool and decrease expected cash flows. Conversely, as market interest rates
and more specifically market mortgage rates rise, repayments will slow and the ultimate
cash flows will tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to
increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These
characteristics contribute to interest only strips generally having a significantly
negative duration, estimated at (32) for the end of year portfolio. These movements are
generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the Company’s other
fixed income investments. The market value of interest only strips in the Company’s
portfolio was $310.2 million at December 31, 2003.

Shortening the duration of the
Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities makes the overall investment portfolio
value less susceptible to valuation variability arising from movement in market interest
rates. With interest rates near record lows, the Company decided to shorten the duration
of its fixed income portfolio. The Company views this action as a temporary defensive
measure to mitigate the potential adverse impact on bond market values, and accordingly
shareholders’ equity, from increasing interest rates.

For each currency in which the
Company has established substantial reserves, the Company seeks to maintain invested
assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately comparable to the estimated
liabilities. Approximately 7.7% of the Company’s consolidated reserves for losses and
LAE and unearned premiums represent estimated amounts payable in foreign currencies.

As of December 31, 2003, 97.3% of the
Company’s total investments and cash were comprised of fixed maturity investments or
cash and 94.1% of the Company’s fixed maturities consisted of investment grade
securities. The average maturity of fixed maturities was 8.3 years at December 31, 2003,
and their overall duration was 4.2 years. The overall duration excluding the impact of the
interest only strips was 5.7 years. As of December 31, 2003, the Company did not have
any investments in commercial real estate or direct commercial mortgages or any material
holdings of derivative investments or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash
flow difficulty to an extent that the Company’s management believes could threaten
the issuer’s ability to meet debt service payments, except where other than temporary
impairments have been recognized.


As of December 31, 2003, the
Company’s common stock portfolio, which is comprised primarily of publicly traded
equity index funds, had a market value of $147.9 million, comprising 1.6% of total
investments and cash. The common stock portfolio is managed with a growth and value
orientation.

Ratings

The following table shows the

A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“Standard &
Poor’s”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”).
These ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be
considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in an equity investment in
an insurance company.

          Best states that the “A+” (“Superior”) rating is assigned to
          those companies which, in its opinion, have a superior ability to meet their
          ongoing obligations to policyholders based on A.M. Best’s comprehensive
          quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company’s balance sheet
          strength, operating performance and business profile. The “A+”
          (“Superior”) rating is the second highest of fifteen ratings assigned
          by A.M. Best, which range from “A++” (“Superior”) to
          “F” (“In Liquidation”). Additionally, A.M. Best has five
          classifications within the “Not Rated” category. Standard &
          Poor’s states that the “AA-” rating is assigned to those
          insurance companies which, in its opinion, have very strong financial security
          characteristics with respect to their ability to pay under its insurance
          policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. The “AA-”
          rating is the fourth highest of nineteen ratings assigned by Standard &
          Poor’s, which range from “AAA” to “R”. Ratings from AA
          to CCC may be modified by the use of a plus or minus sign to show relative
          standing of the insurer within those rating categories. Moody’s states that
          insurance companies rated “Aa” offer excellent financial security.
          Together with the Aaa rated companies, Aa rated companies constitute what are
          generally known as high-grade companies, with Aa rated companies generally
          having somewhat larger long-term risks. Moody’s rating gradations are shown
          through the use of nine distinct symbols, each symbol representing a group of
          ratings in which the financial security is broadly the same. The “Aa3”
          (Excellent) rating is the fourth highest of ratings assigned by Moody’s,
          which range from “Aaa” (Exceptional) to “C” (Lowest).
          Moody’s appends numerical modifiers 1,2 and 3 to each generic rating
          classification from Aa through Caa. Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the
          ranking within a group – with 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest.


Subsidiaries other than Everest Re
and Bermuda Re may not be rated by some or any rating agencies because such ratings are
not considered essential by the individual subsidiary’s customers or because of the
limited nature of the subsidiary’s operations. In particular, Mt. McKinley is not
rated because it is in run-off status. Everest International has had limited business
activity through 2003. If it becomes more active, the establishment of a rating will be
considered.

The following table shows the debt
ratings by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s of the Holdings’
senior notes due March 15, 2005, Holdings’ senior notes due March 15, 2010 and
Capital Trust’s trust preferred securities due November 15, 2032, all of which are
considered investment grade. Debt ratings are a current assessment of the credit
worthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific obligation.

A debt rating of “a” or
“a-” is assigned by A.M. Best where the issuer, in A.M. Best’s opinion, has
a strong ability to meet the terms of the obligation. The “a” and “a-”
ratings are the sixth and seventh highest of 19 ratings assigned by A.M. Best, which range
from “aaa” to “ccc”. A debt rating of “A-” is assigned by
Standard & Poor’s where the obligor has a strong capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation, although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher
rated categories. Standard & Poor’s assigns a debt rating of “BBB” to
issues that exhibit adequate protection parameters although adverse economic conditions or
changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to
meet its financial commitment on the obligation. The “A-” and “BBB”
ratings from Standard & Poor’s are the seventh and ninth highest of 24 ratings
assigned by Standard & Poor’s, which range from “AAA” to “D”.
According to Moody’s, a debt rating of “A3” is assigned to issues that are
considered upper-medium-grade obligations and subject to low credit risk. Obligations
rated “Baa1” are subject to moderate credit risk and are considered medium-grade
and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics. The “A3” and
“Baa1” ratings are the seventh and eighth highest of 21 ratings assigned by
Moody’s, which range from “AAA” to “C”.


All of the above-mentioned ratings
are continually monitored and revised, if necessary, by each of the rating agencies.

The Company believes that its
ratings, in general, are important to its operations because they provide the
Company’s customers and investors with an independent assessment of the
Company’s underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative
comparisons.

Competition

The worldwide reinsurance and
insurance businesses are highly competitive, yet cyclical by product and market.
Competition with respect to the types of reinsurance and insurance business in which the
Company is engaged is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial
strength of the reinsurer or insurer, A.M. Best’s and/or Standard & Poor’s
rating of the reinsurer or insurer, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the
reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered,
premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business
offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines
written. The Company competes in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and
insurance markets with numerous international and domestic reinsurance and insurance
companies. The Company’s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance
companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies,
reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international
underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s. Some of these
competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and have established
long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be a
significant competitive advantage. In addition, the potential for securitization of
reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provides an additional source of
potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition.

In 2003, the improving market trends
established in 2000 and 2001 have continued, generally sustaining upward pressure on
pricing, continued constriction of terms, conditions and coverages and constrained
capacity. There are signs that pressures for incremental firming have abated for property
classes, but these are partially offset by signs that pressures for incremental firming
continue for casualty classes in general. More broadly, the industry remains exposed to
fundamental issues that negatively impacted its aggregate capacity in 2002, including weak
investment market conditions and adverse loss emergence, both of which have continued to
depress the industry’s aggregate financial performance and affect perceptions of the
financial strength of industry participants. These factors suggest that the current
favorable market conditions are likely to persist until further corrective actions,
possibly combined with improving investment market conditions, restore more normal
competitive conditions.

These current trends reflect a clear
reversal of the general trend from 1987 through 1999 which were characterized by increasingly competitive
global market conditions across most lines of business, as reflected by decreasing prices
and broadening contract terms. The earlier trend resulted from a number of factors,
including the emergence of significant reinsurance capacity in Bermuda, changes in the
Lloyd’s market, consolidation and increased capital levels in the insurance and
reinsurance industries, as well as the emergence of new reinsurance and financial
products addressing traditional exposures in alternative fashions. Many of these factors
continue to operate and may take on additional importance as the result of the firming
market conditions that have emerged.


The terrorist attacks on September
11, 2001 (the “September 11 attacks”) solidified and amplified the trend
reversal that began in 2000. These attacks resulted in losses which reduced industry
capacity and were of sufficient magnitude to cause most companies to reassess their
capital position, tolerance for risk, exposure control mechanisms and the pricing terms
and conditions at which they are willing to take on risk. The gradual and variable
improving trend that had been apparent through 2000 and earlier in 2001 firmed
significantly after the September 11 attacks. This firming generally took the form of
immediate and significant upward pressure on prices, more restrictive terms and
conditions and a reduction of coverage limits and capacity availability. Such pressures
were widespread, with variability depending on the product and markets involved, but
mainly depending on the characteristics of the underlying risk exposures. The magnitude
of the changes was sufficient to create temporary disequilibrium in some markets as
individual buyers and sellers adapted to changes in both their internal and market
dynamics.

Through 2002 reinsurance and
insurance markets generally continued to firm, reflecting the continuing implications of
losses arising from the September 11 attacks as well as aggregate company reactions to
broad and growing recognition that competition in the late 1990s reached extremes in many
classes and markets, which ultimately led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms,
conditions and coverages. The effect of these extremes, which had become apparent through
excessive loss emergence, varied widely by company depending on product offerings, markets
accessed, underwriting and operating practices, competitive strategies and business
volumes. Across all market participants, however, the aggregate general effect was
impaired financial results and erosion of the industry capital base. Coupled with
deteriorating investment market conditions and results, and renewed concerns regarding
longer term industry specific issues, including asbestos exposure and sub-par capital
returns, these financial impacts introduced substantial, and in some cases extreme,
pressure for the initiation and/or strengthening of corrective action by individual market
participants. These pressures, aggregating across industry participants, resulted in
firming prices, more restrictive terms and conditions, tightened coverage availability
across most classes and markets and increasing concern with respect to the financial
security of insurance and reinsurance providers, impacts which set the stage for the 2003
trends discussed above.

The Company is generally encouraged
by recent industry developments, which have operated to its advantage, and more broadly,
by continued favorable current market conditions. However, the Company cannot predict with
any reasonable certainty whether and to what extent these conditions will persist.

Employees

As of March 1, 2004, the Company
employed 577 persons. Management believes that its employee relations are good. None of
the Company’s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and the
Company is not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.

Regulatory Matters

The Company and its insurance
subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of the various
jurisdictions in which they conduct business, including essentially all states of the
U.S., Canada, Singapore, the United Kingdom and Bermuda. These regulations vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect ceding insurance
companies and policyholders by regulating the Company’s conduct of business,
financial integrity and ability to meet its obligations relating to its business
transactions and operations. Many of these regulations require reporting of information
designed to allow insurance regulators to closely monitor the Company’s performance.


Insurance Holding Company
Regulation.

Under applicable U.S. laws and regulations, no person, corporation or
other entity may acquire a controlling interest in the Company, unless such person,
corporation or entity has obtained the prior approval for such acquisition from the
Insurance Commissioners of Delaware and the other states in which the Company’s
insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled, currently Arizona, California
and Georgia. Under these laws, “control” is presumed when any person acquires,
directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company. To
obtain the approval of any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file an
application with the relevant insurance commissioner disclosing, among other things, the
background of the acquirer and that of its directors and officers, the acquirer’s
financial condition and its proposed changes in the management and operations of the
insurance company. U.S. state regulators also require prior notice or regulatory approval
of material inter-affiliate transactions within the holding company structure. See
“Dividends”.

The Insurance Companies Act of Canada
also requires prior approval by the Minister of Finance of anyone acquiring a significant
interest in an insurance company authorized to do business in Canada. In addition, the
Company is subject to regulation by the insurance regulators of other states and foreign
jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business. Certain of these states and
foreign jurisdictions impose regulations regulating the ability of any person to acquire
control of an insurance company authorized to do business in that jurisdiction without
appropriate regulatory approval similar to those described above.

Dividends.

Under Bermuda law, Group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend
          if such payment would reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount
          less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its issued share capital
          and share premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts. Group’s ability to
          pay dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends
          from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries is
          limited under Bermuda law as well as the laws of the various U.S. states in
          which Group’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or
          deemed domiciled. The limitations are generally based upon net income and
          compliance with applicable policyholders’ surplus or minimum solvency
          margin and liquidity ratio requirements as determined in accordance with the
          relevant statutory accounting practices. As Holdings has outstanding debt
          obligations, it is dependent upon dividends and other permissible payments from
          its operating subsidiaries to enable it to meet its debt and operating expense
          obligations and to pay dividends to Group.

Under Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is
unable to declare or make payment of a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum solvency
margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is also unable to
declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless, after payment of the
dividend, the value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as certified by its
approved actuary, exceeds its liabilities for long-term business by at least the $250,000
minimum solvency margin. Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority is required if
Bermuda Re’s dividend payments would reduce its prior year end total statutory
capital by 15.0% or more. At December 31, 2003, Bermuda Re and Everest International met
their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant margin.

The payment of dividends to Holdings
by Everest Re is subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law. Generally, Everest Re may
only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus, which was $1,139.0 million at
December 31, 2003, and only after it has given 10 days prior notice to the Delaware
Insurance Commissioner. During this 10-day period, the Commissioner may, by order, limit
or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the Commissioner finds the insurer to be
presently or potentially in financial distress. Further, the maximum amount of dividends
that may be paid without the prior approval of the Delaware Insurance Commissioner in any
twelve month period is the greater of (1) 10% of an insurer’s statutory surplus as of
the end of the prior calendar year or (2) the insurer’s statutory net income, not
including realized capital gains, for the prior calendar year. Under this definition, the
maximum amount that will be available for the payment of dividends by Everest Re in 2004
without triggering the requirement for prior approval of regulatory authorities in
connection with a dividend is $171.6 million.


Insurance Regulation.

Neither

Bermuda Re nor Everest International are admitted to do business in any
jurisdiction in the U.S.  Both conduct their insurance business from their offices in
Bermuda. In Bermuda, Bermuda Re and Everest International are regulated by the Insurance
Act 1978 (as amended) and related regulations (the “Act”). The Act establishes
solvency and liquidity standards, auditing and reporting requirements and subjects Bermuda
Re and Everest International to the supervision, investigation and intervention powers of
the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Under the Act, Bermuda Re and Everest International, as
Class 4 insurers, are each required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda, to maintain a minimum of $100 million in statutory
capital and surplus, to have an independent auditor approved by the Bermuda Monetary
Authority conduct an annual audit and report on their respective statutory financial statements and
filings and to have an appointed loss reserve specialist (also approved by the Bermuda
Monetary Authority) review and report on their respective loss reserves annually.

Bermuda Re is also registered under
the Act as a long-term insurer and is thereby authorized to write life and annuity
business. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is required to maintain $250,000 in statutory capital separate from its Class 4 minimum statutory capital and surplus, to maintain a long-term business
fund, to separately account for this business and to have an approved actuary prepare a
certificate concerning its long-term business assets and liabilities to be filed annually.

U.S.    
          domestic property and casualty insurers, including reinsurers, are subject to
          regulation by their state of domicile and by those states in which they are
          licensed. The regulation of reinsurers is typically related to the
          reinsurer’s financial condition, investments, management and operation. The
          rates and policy terms of reinsurance agreements are generally not subject to
          direct regulation by any governmental authority.

The operations of Everest Re’s
foreign branch offices in Canada, Singapore and the United Kingdom are subject to
regulation by the insurance regulatory officials of those jurisdictions. Management
believes that the Company is in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations
pertaining to its business and operations. By March 31, 2004, it is anticipated that
Bermuda Re will have obtained permission to effect and carry out contracts of reinsurance
in the United Kingdom pursuant to Part IV of the Financial Services and Markets Act of
2000 and that Everest Re will complete the transfer of its United Kingdom operations to
Bermuda Re. Through this transaction, Bermuda Re’s operations in the United Kingdom
will become subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority (the
“FSA”). The FSA imposes solvency, capital adequacy, audit, financial reporting
and other regulatory requirements on insurers transacting business in the United Kingdom.
Bermuda Re presently meets or exceeds all of the FSA’s solvency and capital
requirements.

Everest Indemnity, Everest National,
Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to regulations similar to the U.S.
regulations applicable to Everest Re. In addition, Everest National and Everest Security
must comply with substantial regulatory requirements in each state where they conduct
business. These additional requirements include, but are not limited to, rate and policy
form requirements, requirements with regard to licensing, agent appointments,
participation in residual markets and claim handling procedures. These regulations are
primarily designed for the protection of policyholders.


Licenses.

Everest Re is a licensed property and casualty insurer and/or reinsurer in
          all states (except Nevada and Wyoming), the District of Columbia and Puerto
          Rico. In New Hampshire and Puerto Rico, Everest Re is licensed for reinsurance
          only. Such licensing enables U.S. domestic ceding company clients to take credit
          for reinsurance ceded to Everest Re.

Everest Re is licensed as a property
and casualty reinsurer in Canada. It is also authorized to conduct reinsurance business in
the United Kingdom and Singapore. Everest Re can also write reinsurance in other foreign
countries. Because some jurisdictions require a reinsurer to register in order to be an
acceptable market for local insurers, Everest Re is registered as a foreign insurer and/or
reinsurer in the following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and the Philippines. Everest National is
licensed in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Everest Indemnity is licensed in
Delaware and is eligible to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in 49 states, the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Everest Security is licensed in Georgia and Alabama.
Mt. McKinley is licensed in Delaware and California. Bermuda Re and Everest International
are registered as Class 4 insurers in Bermuda. Bermuda Re is also registered as a
long-term insurer in Bermuda.

Periodic Examinations.

Everest
Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity, Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to
periodic financial examination (usually every 3 years) of their affairs by the insurance
departments of the states in which they are licensed, authorized or accredited. Everest
Re’s, Everest Security’s, Everest Indemnity’s and Mt. McKinley’s last
examination reports were as of December 31, 2000, while Everest National’s last
examination was as of December 31, 2001. None of these reports contained any material
findings or recommendations. In addition, U.S. insurance companies are subject to
examinations by the various state insurance departments where they are licensed concerning
compliance with applicable conduct of business regulations.

NAIC Risk-Based Capital
Requirements.

The U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(“NAIC”) employs a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a
property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in
light of its size and risk profile. The major categories of a company’s risk profile
are its asset risk, credit risk, and underwriting risk. The standards are an effort by the
NAIC to prevent insolvencies, to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance
companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments.

Under the approved formula, a
company’s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital (“RBC”).
If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no action is necessary. Below this threshold
are four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees
of authority over a domestic insurer as the ratio of surplus to RBC decreases. The mildest
intervention requires the company to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions. The
most severe action requires the company to be rehabilitated or liquidated.

Based on their financial positions at
December 31, 2003, Everest Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity and Everest Security
exceed the minimum thresholds. Since Mt. McKinley ceased writing new and renewal insurance
in 1985, its domiciliary regulator, Delaware, has exempted Mt. McKinley from complying
with RBC requirements. Various proposals to change the RBC formula arise from time to
time. The Company is unable to predict whether any such proposal will be adopted, the form
in which any such proposals would be adopted or the effect, if any, the adoption of any
such proposal or change in the RBC calculations would have on the Company.


Codification of Statutory
Accounting Principles.

The NAIC has published a codification of statutory accounting
principles, which has been adopted by the states of domicile of the Company’s U.S.
operating subsidiaries with an effective date of January 1, 2001. On January 1, 2001,
significant changes to the statutory basis of accounting became effective. The cumulative
effect of these changes in 2001 was a $57.1 million increase to Everest Re’s
statutory surplus.

Tax Matters.

The
following summary of the taxation of the Company is based on current law. There can be no
assurances that legislative, judicial, or administrative changes will not be enacted that
materially affect this summary.

Bermuda.

Under current Bermuda law, no income, withholding or capital gains taxes are
          imposed upon Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries. Group and its Bermuda
          subsidiaries have received an undertaking from the Minister of Finance in
          Bermuda that, in the event of any taxes being imposed, Group and its Bermuda
          subsidiaries will be exempt from taxation in Bermuda until March 2016.
          Non-Bermuda branches of Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the
          jurisdictions in which they operate.

Barbados.

Group, a Bermuda company with its principal office in Barbados, is
          registered as an external company under the Companies Act, Cap. 308 of Barbados
          and is licensed as an international business company under the Barbados
          International Business Companies Act, 1991-24. As a result, Group is subject to
          a preferred rate of corporation tax on profits and gains in Barbados and is
          exempt from withholding tax on dividends, interest, royalties, management fees,
          fees or other income paid or deemed paid to a person who is not resident in
          Barbados or who, if so resident, carries on an international business. No tax is
          imposed on capital gains.

United States.

Group’s
U.S. subsidiaries conduct business in and are subject to taxation in the U.S. Non-U.S.
branches of U.S. subsidiaries are subject to local taxation in the jurisdictions in which
they operate. Should the U.S. subsidiaries distribute current or accumulated earnings and
profits in the form of dividends or otherwise to Group, the Company would be subject to
withholding taxes. Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries believe that they have operated and
will continue to operate their businesses in a manner that will not cause them to generate
income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the
U.S. On this basis, Group does not expect that it and its Bermuda subsidiaries will be
required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes other than withholding taxes on certain
investment income and premium excise taxes. If Group or its Bermuda subsidiaries were
subject to U.S. income tax; there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 2. Properties

Everest Re’s corporate offices
are located in approximately 115,000 square feet of leased office space in Liberty Corner,
New Jersey. Bermuda Re’s corporate offices are located in approximately 3,600 total
square feet of leased office space in Hamilton, Bermuda. The Company’s other twelve
locations occupy a total of approximately 59,000 square feet, all of which are leased.
Management believes that the above-described office space is adequate for its current and
anticipated needs.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company does not believe that
there are any material pending legal proceedings to which it or any of its subsidiaries is
a party or of which any of their property is the subject.

In the ordinary course of business,
the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute
resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the Company’s rights and
obligations under insurance and reinsurance agreements and other more general contracts.
In some disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect
funds owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others to
collect funds or enforce alleged rights. Such disputes are resolved through formal and
informal means, including litigation and arbitration.

In all such matters, the Company
believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. The Company also
regularly evaluates those positions, and where appropriate, establishes or adjusts
insurance reserves to reflect its evaluation. The Company’s aggregate reserves take
into account the possibility that the Company may not ultimately prevail in each and every
disputed matter. The Company believes its aggregate reserves reduce the potential that an
adverse resolution of one or more of these matters, at any point in time, would have a
material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
However, there can be no assurances that adverse resolutions of such matters in any one
period or in the aggregate will not result in a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations.

Dividend History and
Restrictions

In 1995, the Board of Directors of
Holdings established a policy of declaring regular quarterly cash dividends and has paid a
regular quarterly dividend in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 1995. The Company
declared and paid its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share for each quarter
of 2002 and $0.09 per share for each quarter of 2003. A committee of the Company’s
Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per share, payable on or before March 19,
2004 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2004.

The declaration and payment of future
dividends, if any, by the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and
will depend upon many factors, including the Company’s earnings, financial condition,
business needs and growth objectives, capital and surplus requirements of its operating
subsidiaries, regulatory restrictions, rating agency considerations and other factors. As
an insurance holding company, the Company is partially dependent on dividends and other
permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. The
payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to
Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re will
be subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. See “Regulatory Matters
– Dividends” and Note 14A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Selected
Financial Data

The following selected consolidated
GAAP financial data of the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002,
2001, 2000 and 1999 were derived from the consolidated financial statements of the
Company, which were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The following financial data
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes.

(1)  Catastrophe losses are net of reinsurance.  A catastrophe is defined, for purposes of the Selected Consolidated Financial Data, as an event that causes a pre-tax loss on property
      exposures before reinsurance of at least $5.0 million and has an event date of January 1, 1988 or later

(2)  Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.

(3)  Based on weighted average basic shares outstanding of 54.0 million, 50.3 million, 46.2 million, 45.9 million and 48.5 million for 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
      for 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

(4)  Based on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 55.0 million, 51.1 million, 47.1 million, 46.4 million and 48.7 million for 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

(5)  Loss ratio is the GAAP losses and LAE incurred as a percentage of GAAP net premiums earned.  Underwriting expense ratio is the GAAP commissions, brokerage, taxes, fees and
      general expenses as a percentage of GAAP net premiums earned.  Combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and underwriting expense ratio.

(6)  Based on 55.7 million, 50.9 million, 46.3 million, 46.0 million and 46.5 million shares outstanding for December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

ITEM 7.  Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following is a discussion of the
results of operations and financial condition of the Company. This discussion and analysis
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes
thereto presented under ITEM 8.

Restructuring

On February 24, 2000, a corporate
restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding company of Holdings,
which remains the holding company for Group’s U.S. operations.

Acquisitions

On September 19, 2000, Holdings
completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Gibraltar
from The Prudential for $51.8 million, which approximated book value. As a result of the
acquisition, Gibraltar became a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings and, immediately
following the acquisition, its name was changed to Mt. McKinley. In connection with the
acquisition of Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, Prupac, a
subsidiary of The Prudential, provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0
million) of the first $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley’s
reserves as of September 19, 2000. In addition, The Prudential guaranteed Prupac’s
obligation to Mt. McKinley. There were $81.1 million, $56.7 million and $22.2 million of
cessions under this reinsurance for years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, exhausting the limit available under this contract.


In connection with the Mt. McKinley
acquisition, Prupac also provided excess of loss reinsurance for 100% of the first $8.5
million of loss with respect to certain of Mt. McKinley’s retrocessions and
potentially uncollectible reinsurance coverage. There were no cessions under this
reinsurance for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, maintaining the limit
available under the contract at $2.4 million. There was $3.6 million of cessions under
this reinsurance for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Mt.    
          McKinley, a run-off property and casualty insurer in the U.S., had a long
          relationship with Holdings and its principal operating company, Everest Re. Mt.
          McKinley was formed in 1978 by Everest Re and wrote insurance until 1985, when
          it was placed in run-off. In 1991, Mt. McKinley became a subsidiary of The
          Prudential. Mt. McKinley is also a reinsurer of Everest Re. Under a series of
          transactions dating to 1986, Mt. McKinley reinsured several components of
          Everest Re’s business. In particular, Mt. McKinley provided stop loss
          reinsurance protection, in connection with the Company’s October 5, 1995
          initial public offering, for any adverse loss development on Everest Re’s
          June 30, 1995 (December 31, 1994 for catastrophe losses) reserves, with $375.0
          million in limits, of which $103.9 million remains available (the “Stop
          Loss Agreement”). The Stop Loss Agreement and other reinsurance contracts
          between Mt. McKinley and Everest Re remain in effect following the acquisition.
          However, these contracts became transactions with affiliates effective on the
          date of the Mt. McKinley acquisition, and their financial impact is thereafter
          eliminated in consolidation. Effective September 19, 2000, Mt. McKinley and
          Bermuda Re entered into a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance agreement, whereby
          Mt. McKinley transferred, for what management believes to be arm’s-length
          consideration, all of its net insurance exposures and reserves to Bermuda Re.

Industry Conditions

The worldwide reinsurance and
insurance businesses are highly competitive yet cyclical by product and market.
Competition with respect to the types of reinsurance and insurance business in which the
Company is engaged is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial
strength of the reinsurer or insurer, A.M. Best’s and/or Standard & Poor’s
rating of the reinsurer or insurer, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the
reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered,
premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business
offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines
written. The Company competes in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and
insurance markets with numerous international and domestic reinsurance and insurance
companies. The Company’s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance
companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies,
reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international
underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s. Some of these
competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and have established
long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be a
significant competitive advantage. In addition, the potential for securitization of
reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provides an additional source of
potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition.


In 2003, the improving market trends
established in 2000 and 2001 have continued generally sustaining upward pressure on
pricing, continued constriction of terms, conditions and coverages and constrained
capacity. There are signs that pressures for incremental firming have abated for property
classes, but these are partially offset by signs that pressures for incremental firming
continue for casualty classes in general. More broadly, the industry remains exposed to
fundamental issues that negatively impacted its aggregate capacity in 2002, including weak
investment market conditions and adverse loss emergence, both of which have continued to
depress the industry’s aggregate financial performance and affect perceptions of the
financial strength of industry participants. These factors suggest that the current favorable
market conditions are likely to persist until further corrective actions, possibly
combined with improving investment market conditions, restore more normal competitive
conditions.

These current trends reflect a clear
reversal of the general trend from 1987 through 1999, which were characterized by increasingly competitive
global market conditions across most lines of business, as reflected by decreasing prices
and broadening contract terms. The earlier trend resulted from a number of factors,
including the emergence of significant reinsurance capacity in Bermuda, changes in the
Lloyd’s market, consolidation and increased capital levels in the insurance and
reinsurance industries, as well as the emergence of new reinsurance and financial products
addressing traditional exposures in alternative fashions. Many of these factors continue
to operate and may take on additional importance as the result of the firming market
conditions that have emerged.

The September 11 attacks solidified
and amplified the trend reversal that began in 2000. These attacks resulted in losses
which reduced industry capacity and were of sufficient magnitude to cause most companies
to reassess their capital position, tolerance for risk, exposure control mechanisms and
the pricing terms and conditions at which they are willing to take on risk. The gradual
and variable improving trend that had been apparent through 2000 and earlier in 2001
firmed significantly after the September 11 attacks. This firming generally took the form
of immediate and significant upward pressure on prices, more restrictive terms and
conditions and a reduction of coverage limits and capacity availability. Such pressures
were widespread with variability depending on the product and markets involved, but mainly
depending on the characteristics of the underlying risk exposures. The magnitude of the
changes was sufficient to create temporary disequilibrium in some markets as individual
buyers and sellers adapted to changes in both their internal and market dynamics.

Through 2002 reinsurance and
insurance markets generally continued to firm, reflecting the continuing implications of
losses arising from the September 11 attacks as well as aggregate company reactions to
broad and growing recognition that competition in the late 1990s reached extremes in many
classes and markets, which ultimately led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms,
conditions and coverages. The effect of these extremes, which had become apparent through
excessive loss emergence, varied widely by company depending on product offerings, markets
accessed, underwriting and operating practices, competitive strategies and business
volumes. Across all market participants, however, the aggregate general effect was
impaired financial results and erosion of the industry capital base. Coupled with
deteriorating investment market conditions and results, and renewed concerns regarding
longer term industry specific issues, including asbestos exposure and sub-par capital
returns, these financial impacts introduced substantial, and in some cases extreme,
pressure for the initiation and/or strengthening of corrective action by individual market
participants. These pressures, aggregating across industry participants, resulted in
firming prices, more restrictive terms and conditions, tightened coverage availability
across most classes and markets and increasing concern with respect to the financial
security of insurance and reinsurance providers, impacts which set the stage for the 2003
trends discussed above.


The Company is generally encouraged
by recent industry developments, which have operated to its advantage, and more broadly,
by continued favorable current market conditions. However, the Company cannot predict with
any reasonable certainty whether and to what extent these conditions will persist.

financial results. The following is a three year summary of consolidated underwriting

As indicated in the preceding
Industry Conditions section, the reinsurance and insurance industry has experienced very
favorable market conditions over the past three years. The favorable market conditions
coupled with the Company’s financial strength, strategic positioning and market and
underwriting expertise enabled it to significantly increase its volume of business. As a
result, gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased by 60.7%
compared with the year ended December 31, 2002, which had increased 51.8% compared with
the year ended December 31, 2001. Gross written premiums for the year ended December 31,
2001 had increased by 35.3% compared with the year ended December 31, 2000. Due to the
nature of its businesses, the Company is unable to precisely differentiate the effects of
price changes as compared to changes in exposure. Similarly, because individual
reinsurance arrangements often reflect revised coverages, structuring, pricing, terms
and/or conditions from period to period, the Company is unable to differentiate between
the premium volumes attributable to new business as compared to renewal business.
Management believes however, that on balance, during the past three years, the more
significant component of growth related to growth in exposures underwritten with a lesser
but still significant component relating to increased pricing and/or improved terms and
conditions. Management believes further that market conditions are generally more
favorable for casualty business classes than for property business classes; however,
management notes that it continues to see business opportunities in virtually all
operating classes and markets. Although premium volumes have increased significantly, the
Company continues to decline business that does not meet its objectives regarding
underwriting profitability.

The other components of underwriting
gain (loss) are highly correlated to the level of premium volume. The amount of net
written premiums reflects gross written premiums less ceded premiums. Premiums ceded were
$258.4 million (5.6% of gross written premiums), $208.9 million (7.3% of gross written
premiums) and $314.5 million (16.8% of gross written premiums) for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The fluctuation in ceded premiums was
primarily due to adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the Company’s
accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocessional programs. The amount of the
adjustment premiums was $49.6 million, $54.5 million and $139.4 million for years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The larger amount of adjustment premium
for 2001 relates primarily to losses ceded in conjunction with the September 11 attacks
and the Enron bankruptcy. The increase in ceded premiums for 2003 and 2002 relates in part
to specific reinsurance programs in the U.S. Insurance segment, which totaled $146.4
million and $116.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Incurred losses and LAE also
increased as a result of the increased premium volume. However, the percentage increase in
losses was less than the percentage increase in premium volume since part of the premium
increase represented improvement in pricing, terms and conditions, as opposed to an
increase in exposures. Partially offsetting the impact of improved pricing was the effect
of prior year loss reserve strengthening. The increase in losses relating to prior period
reserve strengthening was $256.9 million, $140.1 million and $0.0 million for years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See ITEM 1, “

Business

—

Changes in Historical Reserves”

for additional details and explanation.

Commission, brokerage and tax expense
also increased as a result of the increasing premium volume as these generally vary in
direct proportion to premium. However, the percentage increase was generally less than the
percentage increase in premium volume, reflecting the generally improving market
conditions, which tend to provide the Company a relatively greater ability to exert
downward pressure on commission and brokerage rates.


The increase in net investment income
to $402.1 million, $350.6 million and $340.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, is also correlated to the increased premium volume.
Premiums are generally collected over the first 12 to 15 months of the reinsurance
contract while related losses are typically paid out over numerous years, resulting in an
increase in cash flow when premiums are increasing. The Company’s cash flow from
operations was $1,653.8 million, $736.1 million and $406.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Coupled with common stock offerings and
the issuance of trust preferred securities, this facilitated the growth in the
Company’s total investments and cash to $9,314.8 million, $7,259.1 million and
$5,783.5 million as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The impact on net
investment income resulting from the growth in the investment portfolio was partially
offset by an overall decline in interest rates during this same time period.

Net realized capital losses of $38.0
million, $50.0 million and $22.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively, were primarily the result of write-downs in the value of securities
deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, partially offset by realized
gains.

The Company generated an income tax
expense of $65.2 million and $30.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, generally reflecting improved underwriting and investment income results.
The income tax benefit of $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily
reflected a tax benefit from various unusual loss events in 2001, in particular the
September 11 attacks and Enron, which were partially offset by taxable income on a former
client’s demutualization.

The increase in net income to $426.0
million and $231.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
generally reflects improved underwriting and investment results partially offset by
increased income taxes. The net income of $99.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2001 reflects the impact of the unusual loss events in 2001. As a result of the
September 11 attacks, the Company incurred pre-tax losses in 2001, based on an estimate of
ultimate exposure developed through a review of its coverages, of $213.2 million gross of
reinsurance and $55.0 million net of reinsurance. Associated with this reinsurance was
$60.0 million of pre-tax charges, predominantly from adjustment premiums, which resulted
in a total pre-tax loss from the September 11 attacks of $115.0 million. After-tax
recoveries relating specifically to this unusual loss event totaled $75.0 million. Over
90% of the losses ceded by the Company were pursuant to treaties where the
reinsurers’ obligations are secured, which the Company believes eliminates material
reinsurance collection risk. As a result of the Enron bankruptcy, the Company incurred
losses in 2001, amounting to $25.0 million after-tax and net of reinsurance. This unusual
loss reflected all of the Company’s exposures to this event, including underwriting,
credit and investment. The above-mentioned unusual 2001 events were partially offset by
the income received from a former client’s demutualization.

The Company’s shareholders’
equity increased to $3,164.9 million, $2,368.6 million and $1,720.5 million as of December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This increase is due to increased net income,
common stock offerings and increased unrealized appreciation on the Company’s
investments. Management believes that the Company generally has sufficient capital and
resources to meet its known obligations.


Segment Information

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property
and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance
brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S.  The U.S. Insurance
operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent
relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting
operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and
worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation
writes property and casualty reinsurance through the Company’s branches in London,
Canada, and Singapore, in addition to foreign business written through the Company’s
Miami and New Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to
worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers
and directly with ceding companies.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, including with
respect to capital, investments and support operations. As a result, management monitors
and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments principally based upon
their underwriting results. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance but such
reinsurance does not impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the
segment in which the business was first produced.

The following tables present the
relevant underwriting results for the operating segments for the three years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.


The Company has recently announced
that one of its subsidiaries, Everest Re, has reached agreement, subject to regulatory
approval, to sell its United Kingdom branch to another of the Company’s subsidiaries, Bermuda Re.  Business for this branch is currently reported through
the International segment. Upon completion of the transaction, the business of this branch
will be included in the Bermuda segment. Appropriate disclosures will be made in future
filings to address the segment financial result fluctuations caused by the transfer.

The Company has also recently
announced that another subsidiary, Everest National, has opened a regional office in
California to better serve its western U.S. Insurance business. The additional office will
not affect segment reporting.


Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31,
2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Premiums.

Gross written premiums increased 60.7% to $4,573.8 million in 2003 from
          $2,846.5 million in 2002, as the Company took advantage of the general firming
          of rates, terms and conditions and selected growth opportunities, while
          continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. Premium growth areas included a 95.9%
($857.7 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, principally related to a
$519.4 million increase in treaty casualty business, a $253.9 million increase in treaty
property business and a $62.8 million increase in facultative business. The International
operation increased 78.3% ($423.4 million), primarily due to a $256.9 million increase in
premiums from the London branch, a $79.6 million increase in international business
written through the Miami and New Jersey offices representing primarily Latin American
business and a $67.4 million increase to Canadian business. The U.S. Insurance operation
grew 30.2% ($248.1 million), principally as a result of an $89.5 million increase in
workers’ compensation and a $73.2 million increase in excess and surplus lines
insurance. The Bermuda operation increased $183.8 million, reflecting a shift toward more
traditional business resulting from the rollout of treaty, facultative and individual risk
capabilities. The Specialty Underwriting operation increased 2.9% ($14.3 million),
resulting primarily from a $38.0 million increase in A&H business and a $19.0 million
decrease in marine and aviation.

Ceded premiums increased to $258.4
million in 2003 from $208.9 million in 2002, principally reflecting growth in specific
reinsurance of the Company’s primary insurance business, which increased from $116.1
million to $146.4 million. In addition, ceded premiums for 2003 included $49.6 million in
adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess
of loss element of the Company’s corporate retrocessional programs, while ceded
premiums for 2002 included $5.1 million and $49.4 million in adjustment premium relating
to claims made under the 2001 and 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss elements of
the Company’s corporate retrocessional programs, respectively.

Net written premiums increased by
63.6% to $4,315.4 million in 2003 from $2,637.6 million in 2002, reflecting the increase
in gross written premiums, combined with the growth in ceded premiums.

Premium Revenues.

Net premiums
earned increased by 64.4% to $3,737.9 million in 2003 from $2,273.7 million in 2002.
Contributing to this increase was a 96.0% ($697.5 million) increase in the U.S.
Reinsurance operation, a 79.9% ($377.4 million) increase in the International operation, a
43.7% ($250.5 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation, a $129.8 million increase
in the Bermuda operation and an 1.9% ($9.0 million) increase in the Specialty Underwriting
operation. All of these changes reflect period-to-period changes in net written premiums
and business mix together with normal variability in earnings patterns. Business mix
changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business,
distribution channels and markets but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew,
almost always with changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new
contracts are accepted with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from
those of expiring contracts. As premium reporting and earnings and loss and commission
characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts, the continuous
turnover of individual contracts, arising from both strategic shifts and day to day
underwriting, can and does introduce appreciable background variability in various
underwriting line items.


Expenses.

Incurred loss and LAE increased by 59.6% to $2,600.2 million in 2003 from
          $1,629.4 million in 2002. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was
          principally attributable to the increase in net premiums earned, the impact of
          changes in the Company’s mix of business and reserve adjustments for prior
          period losses.

Net prior period reserve adjustments
for non-A&E exposures for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $206.7 million, which
were net of a cession of $85 million under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss
component of the Company’s corporate retrocessional program. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, net prior period reserve adjustments for non-A&E exposures were
$116.6 million, which were net of cessions of $11 million and $90 million under the 2001
and 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss components of the Company’s corporate
retrocessional program, respectively.

The U.S. Reinsurance segment
accounted for $134.2 million and $96.7 million of the net prior period reserve adjustments
for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The two principal
underwriting areas responsible for these deficiencies are professional liability and
general casualty. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, there had been a proliferation of
claims relating to bankruptcies and other financial management improprieties. This
increased number of claims combined with larger claims has significantly increased
incurred losses on the professional liability policies. In the general casualty area, the
Company continues to experience losses greater than historical trends for accident years
1998 through 2003. These losses are being driven by unfavorable trends in litigation and
economic variability. In both the professional liability and general casualty reinsurance
areas, the Company relies upon loss reports from ceding companies. Although the Company
generally records reserves at higher levels than those reported by ceding companies,
actual reported results have exceeded the initial loss indications. The reserve
adjustments in these areas were partially offset by favorable reserve development relating
to property reinsurance for the 2002 accident year.

The U.S. Insurance segment reflected
$58.7 million and $14.0 million of net prior period reserve adjustments for years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, principally due to California workers’
compensation insurance. This is a relatively new book of business being written in a
challenging political and economical environment. While management believes the cumulative
results through 2003 remain positive, there has been some deterioration in claim frequency
and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002.

The International segment had net
prior period reserve adjustments of $44.6 million and $6.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These reserve adjustments relate primarily to
general casualty business written in the U.S., U.K. and Canada on both a quota share and
excess basis for accident years 1996 through 2002, with the larger development on the 1998
through 2000 years. For accident year 2002, the adverse general casualty experience was
partially offset by favorable property experience.

The Specialty Underwriting segment
had net prior period reserve adjustments of $23.9 million and $0.4 million for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The favorable adjustments, particularly
for 2003, related primarily to A&H business and cessions under the corporate
retrocessional program and related principally to the 2000 through 2002 accident years.


The Bermuda segment reflected $6.9
million of favorable net prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31,
2003 and no development for the year ended December 31,2002.

Reserve related to A&E exposures
were $50.2 million and $23.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written by the Company
prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley acquisition in
September 2000. The strengthening on business written by the Company, net of reinsurance,
was $16.7 million and the net strengthening on the acquired business was $33.5 million.
Substantially all of the Company’s A&E exposures relate to insurance and
reinsurance contracts with coverage periods prior to 1986.

Incurred losses and LAE include
catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable
and unfavorable development on prior period events, and are net of reinsurance. A
catastrophe is an event that causes a pre-tax loss on property exposures of at least $5.0
million and has an event date of January 1, 1988 or later. Catastrophe losses, net of
contract specific cessions, were $36.8 million in 2003, relating principally to the May
2003 tornado and hailstorm events and hurricanes Fabian and Isabel, compared to $30.2
million in 2002.

In all cases, the prior period
development reflects management’s judgment as to the implications of losses and claim
information reported during the period on the Company’s reserve balances.

Incurred losses and LAE in 2003
reflected ceded losses and LAE of $278.4 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2002
of $287.7 million. The ceded losses and LAE in 2003 included $85.0 million of losses ceded
under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company’s
corporate retrocessional program and $81.1 million under the Prupac/Mt. McKinley
reinsurance agreement. The ceded losses and LAE in 2002 included $11.0 million and $90.0
million of losses ceded under the 2001 and 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss
components of the Company’s corporate retrocessional program, respectively, and $56.7
million under the Prupac/Mt. McKinley reinsurance agreement.

The segment components of the
increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2003 from 2002 were a 97.6% ($523.1 million)
increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, an 80.8% ($238.6 million) increase in the
International operation, a 39.9% ($172.7 million) increase in the U.S Insurance operation,
a $54.4 million increase in the Bermuda operation, partially offset by a 5.7% ($18.0
million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. These changes generally reflect
increases in premiums earned, changes in the current year loss expectation assumptions for
business written generally reflecting continued improvement in market conditions and
pricing, increase in catastrophe losses and the net prior period reserve development
discussed above. Incurred losses and LAE for each operation were also impacted by
variability relating to changes in the level of premium volume and the mix of business by
class and type.

The Company’s loss and LAE ratio
(“loss ratio”), which is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net
premiums earned, decreased by 2.1 percentage points to 69.6% in 2003 from 71.7% in 2002,
reflecting the premiums earned and incurred losses and LAE discussed above, as well as the
general firming of rates, terms and conditions and changes in business mix.


The following table shows the loss
ratios for each of the Company’s operating segments for 2003 and 2002. The loss
ratios for all operations were impacted by the expense factors noted above.

Segment underwriting expenses
increased by 54.0% to $952.6 million in 2003 from $618.5 million in 2002. Commission,
brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $312.2 million, principally reflecting increases in
premium volume and changes in the mix of business, together with the Company’s
emphasis on acquisition cost control. Segment other underwriting expenses increased by
$21.9 million as the Company expanded operations to support its increased business volume.
Contributing to these underwriting expense increases were an 84.8% ($170.9 million)
increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, a 76.0% ($93.8 million) increase in the
International operation, a 24.7% ($36.7 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation,
a $29.6 million increase in the Bermuda operation and a 2.3% ($3.1 million) increase in
the Specialty Underwriting operation. The changes for each operation’s expenses
principally resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium
volume and business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of
specific reinsurance as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business.
The Company’s expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by
net premiums earned, was 25.6% in 2003 compared to 27.3% in 2002.

The Company’s combined ratio,
which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, decreased by 3.8 percentage points to
95.2% in 2003 compared to 99.0% in 2002.

The following table shows the

Investments.

Net
investment income increased 14.7% to $402.1 million in 2003 from $350.6 million in 2002,
principally reflecting the effects of investing $1,653.8 million of cash flow from
operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, $203.4 million of net proceeds
from Capital Trust’s issuance of trust preferred securities in November 2002 and
$316.8 million of net proceeds from the issuance of Group’s common shares in April
2003, all partially offset by the effects of the lower interest rate environment.

Net realized capital losses were
$38.0 million in 2003, reflecting realized capital losses on the Company’s
investments of $88.7 million, which included $25.7 million relating to write-downs in the
value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, and $46.2
million related to the impairment on interest only strips in accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on
Purchased and Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets” (“EITF
99-20”), partially offset by $50.7 million of realized capital gains, which included
$16.8 million of realized capital gains on sales of the interest only strips, compared to
net realized capital losses of $50.0 million in 2002. The net realized capital losses in
2002 reflected realized capital losses on the Company’s investments of $142.8
million, which included $101.3 million relating to write-downs in the value of securities
deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, of which $33.0 million was for
WorldCom, Inc., partially offset by $92.8 million of realized capital gains. The Company
owned no interest only strips during 2002.

The Company has a small number of
credit default swaps, which it no longer writes, and specialized equity put options in its
product portfolio. These products meet the definition of a derivative under Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“FAS 133”). Net derivative income from these derivative
transactions in 2003, was $5.9 million, which principally reflects changes in fair value
of the specialized equity put options, compared to net derivative expenses of $14.5
million in 2002, which principally related to the specialized equity put options. See also
Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Other expense in 2003 was $1.0
million compared to $2.1 million in 2002. The decrease in net expenses for 2003 was due to
foreign exchange gains, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses.

Corporate underwriting expenses not
allocated to segments increased to $6.0 million for 2003 compared with $3.2 million for
2002 as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support increased business volume.

Distributions on the trust preferred
securities are cumulative and pay quarterly in arrears. Distributions relating to the
trust preferred securities were $16.5 million in 2003 compared to $2.1 million in 2002.
These securities were issued in November 2002.

Interest expense in 2003 was $40.3
million compared to $42.4 million in 2002. Interest expense in 2003 reflected $38.9
million relating to the senior notes and $1.4 million relating to borrowings under the
revolving credit facility. Interest expense in 2002 reflected $38.9 million relating to
the issuance of the senior notes and $3.5 million relating to borrowings under the
revolving credit facility.

Income Taxes.

The Company
recognized income tax expense of $65.2 million in 2003 compared to $30.7 million in

.

The increase in taxes generally reflects the improved underwriting and
investment income results.

Net Income.

Net income was
$426.0 million in 2003 compared to net income of $231.3 million in 2002, reflecting
improved underwriting and investment income results partly offset by increased income
taxes.

Year Ended December 31,
2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Premiums.

Gross written premiums increased 51.8% to $2,846.5 million in 2002 from
          $1,874.6 million in 2001, as the Company took advantage of selected growth
          opportunities and improving pricing in many classes of business, while
          continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. Premium growth areas
          included a 303.8% ($76.0 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, which
          continues to expand its product line offerings, a 67.6% ($218.1 million)
          increase in the International operation, mainly attributable to growth in the
          London, Canadian and Latin American markets, a 63.5% ($319.1 million) increase
          in the U.S. Insurance operation, principally attributable to growth in
          worker’s compensation insurance, a 46.5% ($284.1 million) increase in the
          U.S. Reinsurance operation, primarily reflecting growth across property and
          casualty lines, and an 18.0% ($74.6 million) increase in the Specialty
          Underwriting operation, mainly attributable to growth in marine, aviation and
          surety business. The Company continued to decline business that did not meet its
          objectives regarding underwriting profitability.

Ceded premiums decreased to $208.9
million in 2002 from $314.5 million in 2001. This decrease was principally attributable to
a reduction in cessions made under the Company’s corporate retrocessional program and
to a decrease in ceded premiums in the U.S. Insurance operation as a result of changes in
this segment’s specific reinsurance programs. Ceded premiums in 2002 included $5.1
million and $49.4 million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the 2001
and 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss elements of the Company’s corporate
retrocessional programs, respectively. Ceded premiums in 2001 included $81.3 million and
$58.1 million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the 2001 and 1999
accident year aggregate excess of loss elements of the Company’s corporate
retrocessional programs, respectively, with the 2001 accident year cessions principally
relating to losses incurred as a result of the September 11 attacks and Enron bankruptcy.


Net written premiums increased by
69.1% to $2,637.6 million in 2002 from $1,560.1 million in 2001. This increase was a
result of the increase in gross written premiums and the decrease in ceded premiums.

Premium Revenues.

Net earned
premiums increased by 54.9% to $2,273.7 million in 2002 from $1,467.5 million in 2001.
Contributing to this increase were an 154.4% ($25.3 million) increase in the Bermuda
operation, a 94.8% ($278.8 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation, a 64.4%
($185.1 million) increase in the International operation, a 46.0% ($228.8 million)
increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation and a 23.7% ($88.2 million) increase in the
Specialty Underwriting operation. All of these changes reflect period to period
variability in gross written and ceded premiums and business mix, together with normal
variability in earnings patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company
shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets but
also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in coverage,
structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted with coverages,
structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring contracts. As premium
reporting and earnings and loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions
of individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual contracts, arising from
both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting, can and does introduce appreciable
background variability in various underwriting line items.

Expenses.

Incurred loss and LAE increased by 34.7% to $1,629.4 million in 2002 from
          $1,209.5 million in 2001. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was
          principally attributable to the increase in net premiums earned and modest net
          prior period reserve adjustments in select areas, most notably in D&O
          liability, surety and workers’ compensation lines, and with respect to
          asbestos exposures, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses and
          improvements in rates, terms and conditions in many classes of business, as well
          as the impact of changes in the Company’s mix of business.

Incurred losses and LAE include
catastrophe losses, which reflect the impact both of current period events and favorable
and unfavorable development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance. A
catastrophe is an event that causes a pre-tax loss on property exposures of at least $5.0
million and has an event date of January 1, 1988 or later. Catastrophe losses, net of
contract specific cessions but before cessions under the corporate retrocessional program,
were $30.2 million in 2002, principally relating to European flood losses and Hurricanes
Isidore and Kenna, compared to net catastrophe losses of $222.6 million in 2001, which was
principally related to the September 11 attacks.

Incurred losses and LAE in 2002
reflected ceded losses and LAE of $287.7 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2001
of $486.3 million. The ceded losses and LAE in 2002 included $11.0 million and $90.0
million of losses ceded under the 2001 and 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss
components of the Company’s corporate retrocessional program, respectively. The ceded
losses and LAE in 2001 included $164.0 million and $105.0 million of losses ceded under
the 2001 and 1999 accident year aggregate excess of loss components of the Company’s
corporate retrocessional program, respectively, with the 2001 accident year cessions
relating principally to losses incurred as the result of the September 11 attacks.

Contributing to the increase in
incurred losses and LAE in 2002 from 2001 were a 242.3% ($36.7 million) increase in the
Bermuda operation, principally reflecting reserve strengthening with respect to Mt.
McKinley asbestos exposures and increased premium volume, a 104.9% ($221.6 million)
increase in the U.S. Insurance operation, principally reflecting increased premium volume
coupled with changes in this segment’s specific reinsurance programs, a 45.8% ($92.8
million) increase in the International operation, principally reflecting increased premium
volume and a 19.2% ($86.3 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, principally
due to increased premium volume, partially offset by decreased catastrophe losses. These
increases were partially offset by a 5.3% ($17.5 million) decrease in the Specialty
Underwriting operation, principally attributable to decreased catastrophe losses. Incurred
losses and LAE for each operation were also impacted by variability relating to changes in
the level of premium volume and mix of business by class and type.


The Company’s loss ratio, which
is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by premiums earned, decreased by 10.7
percentage points to 71.7% in 2002 from 82.4% in 2001, reflecting the earned premium and
incurred losses and LAE discussed above. The following table shows the loss ratios for
each of the Company’s operating segments for 2002 and 2001. The loss ratios for all
operations were impacted by the expense factors noted above as well as by the impact on
ceded premiums of the adjustment premiums under the Company’s corporate
retrocessional program.

Segment underwriting expenses
increased by 36.8% to $618.5 million in 2002 from $452.2 million in 2001. Commission,
brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $155.0 million, principally reflecting increases in
premium volume and changes in the mix of business. Other underwriting expenses increased
by $11.3 million as the Company expanded its operations to support its increased business
volume. Contributing to the underwriting expense increase were a 95.6% ($4.0 million)
increase in the Bermuda operation, a 79.7% ($65.9 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance
operation, a 31.9% ($29.8 million) increase in the International operation, a 27.0% ($29.1
million) increase in the Specialty operation and a 22.8% ($37.4 million) increase in the
U.S. Reinsurance operation. The changes for each operation’s expenses principally
resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium volume and
business mix by class and type and, in some cases, the underwriting performance of the
underlying business. The Company’s expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing
underwriting expenses by premiums earned, decreased by 3.8 percentage points to 27.3% in
2002 compared to 31.1% in 2001.

The Company’s combined ratio,
which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, decreased by 14.5 percentage points to

Investments.

Net investment income increased by 3.0% to $350.6 million in 2002 from
          $340.4 million in 2001, principally reflecting the effect of investing the
          $736.1 million of cash flow from operations in 2002, $346.3 million of net
          proceeds from the offering of Group’s common shares in February 2002 and
          $203.4 million of net proceeds from Capital Trust’s issuance of trust
          preferred securities in November 2002, partially offset by the lower interest
          rate environment. The following table shows a comparison of various investment

The Company because of its income
orientation considers total return, the combination of income yield and capital
appreciation/depreciation, to be less relevant as a measure of performance than may be the
case for investment portfolios managed with alternate strategies. The following table

Net realized capital losses were
$50.0 million in 2002, reflecting realized capital losses on the Company’s
investments of $142.8 million, which includes $101.3 million relating to write-downs in
the value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, of which
$33.0 million were for WorldCom, partially offset by $92.8 million of realized capital
gains, compared to net realized capital losses of $22.3 million in 2001. The net realized
capital losses in 2001 reflected realized capital losses of $55.1 million, which included
$22.6 million relating to write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be impaired on
an other than temporary basis, which were partially offset by $32.8 million of realized
capital gains.

The Company has a small number of
credit default swaps, which it no longer writes, and specialized equity put options in its
product portfolio. These products meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. Net
derivative expense from these derivative transactions in 2002, essentially reflecting
changes in fair value, was $14.5 million, principally relating to the specialized equity
put options, compared to $12.2 million in 2001, principally relating to the credit default
swaps. Net after tax exposure remaining on the credit default agreements is $3.1 million.
See also Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Other expense was $2.1 million in
2002 compared to other income of $28.2 million in 2001. Significant contributors to other
expense in 2002 were foreign exchange losses, normal provision for uncollectible audit
premium in the U.S. Insurance operation and the amortization of deferred expenses relating
to Holdings’ issuance of senior notes and Capital Trust’s issuance of trust
preferred securities, partially offset by fee income. Other income for 2001 includes $25.9
million arising from a non-recurring receipt of shares in connection with the
demutualization of a former insurance company client that had issued annuities to the
Company in connection with certain claim settlement transactions. In addition, other
income for 2001 includes foreign exchange gains as well as fee income, offset by the
amortization of deferred expenses relating to the issuance of senior notes.

Corporate underwriting expenses not
allocated to segments were $3.2 million for 2002 compared with $3.4 million for 2001.

Interest expense was $42.4 million
for 2002 compared to $46.0 million for 2001. Interest expense for 2002 reflects $38.9
million relating to the senior notes and $3.5 million relating to borrowings under the
revolving credit facility. Interest expense for 2001 reflects $38.9 million relating to
the senior notes and $7.1 million relating to borrowings under the revolving credit
facility. In addition, 2002 includes incurred expense of $2.1 million for distributions on
Capital Trust’s trust preferred securities.

Income Taxes.

The Company
generated income tax expense of $30.7 million in 2002 compared to income tax benefits of
$8.7 million in 2001. The tax expense in 2002 was mainly attributable to improved
underwriting and investment results. The tax benefit in 2001 primarily resulted from the
impact of losses relating to the September 11 attacks, the Enron bankruptcy and realized
capital losses recognized in 2001, which reduced taxable income, partially offset by
taxable income relating to the non-recurring receipt of shares in connection with a former
client’s demutualization.

Net Income.

Net income was
$231.3 million in 2002 compared to $99.0 million in 2001. This increase generally reflects
the improved underwriting and investment results, partially offset by increased tax
expense, realized capital losses, derivative expense and a reduction in other income.

Critical Accounting
Policies

The following is a summary of the
critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that (1) require management
to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the
consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions.

Loss and LAE Reserves.

The
Company’s most critical accounting policy is the determination of its loss and LAE
reserves. The Company maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability for
losses and LAE with respect to reported and unreported claims. Because reserves are
estimates of ultimate losses and LAE, management, using a variety of statistical and
actuarial techniques, monitors reserve adequacy over time, evaluating new information, as
it becomes known and adjusting reserves as necessary. Management considers many factors
when setting reserves, including: (1) its exposure base, generally its premiums earned;
(2) its expected loss ratios on current year writings as determined through extensive
interaction between its underwriters and actuaries by product and class categories; (3)
internal actuarial methodologies which analyze the Company’s experience with similar
cases, information from ceding companies and historical trends, such as reserving
patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and
liability; (5) economic conditions; and (6) the uncertainties discussed below regarding
reserve requirements for A&E claims. Based on these considerations, management
believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company’s loss and LAE
reserves. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from
such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change is made. See also Note 1
of Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Asbestos and Environmental
Exposures.

The Company continues to receive claims under expired contracts, asserting
alleged injuries and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and
hazardous substances, including asbestos. The Company’s asbestos claims typically
involve potential liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property
damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos. The Company’s
environmental claims typically involve potential liability for (a) the mitigation or
remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property damage caused
by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water.

The Company’s reserves include
an estimate of the Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims for which ultimate
value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. There are significant
uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E
claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure
and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying
sources of A&E contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility
and/or liability for A&E damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and judicial
interpretation of those laws; (e) potential for an A&E claim to involve many insurance
providers over many policy periods; (f) long reporting delays, both from insureds to
insurance companies and from ceding companies to reinsurers; (g) historical data on
A&E losses, which is more limited and variable than historical information on other
types of casualty claims; (h) questions concerning interpretation and application of
insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (i) uncertainty regarding the number and identity
of insureds with potential A&E exposure.

With respect to asbestos claims in
particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound
the difficulty in estimating the Company’s liability. These developments include: (a)
continued growth in the number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive
plaintiff bar; (b) a disproportionate percentage of claims filed by individuals with no
functional injury from asbestos, claims with little to no financial value but that have
increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the growth in the
number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims
(including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in which companies attempt to resolve their
asbestos liabilities in a manner that is prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers
from the negotiation of bankruptcy plans); (d) the growth in claim filings against
defendants formerly regarded as “peripheral”; (e) the concentration of claims in
a small number of states that favor plaintiffs; (f) the growth in the number of claims
that might impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the
product liability portion; (g) responses in which specific courts have adopted measures to
ameliorate the worst procedural abuses; (h) an increase in settlement values being paid to
asbestos claimants; and (i) the potential that the U. S. Congress or state legislatures
may adopt legislation to address asbestos litigation issues.


Management believes that these
factors continue to render reserves for A&E losses significantly less subject to
traditional actuarial methods than reserves for other types of losses. Given these
uncertainties, management believes that no meaningful range for such ultimate losses can
be established. The Company establishes reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of
management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for the Company or its ceding
companies.

In connection with the acquisition of
Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, Prupac, a subsidiary of
The Prudential, provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the
first $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley’s reserves as of
September 19, 2000. In addition, The Prudential guaranteed Prupac’s obligations to
Mt. McKinley. Through December 31, 2003, cessions under this reinsurance agreement have
exhausted the available remaining limits. Due to the uncertainties discussed above, the
ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves and, depending on coverage
under the Company’s various reinsurance arrangements, could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows. See also Note 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reinsurance Receivable.

The
Company utilizes reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and
catastrophic loss occurrences. These agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a
portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances without relieving the
insurer of its obligation to the policyholder. In the event reinsurers were unable to meet
their obligations under these reinsurance agreements or successfully challenge losses
ceded by the Company under the reinsurance contracts, the Company would not be able to
realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balance. In some cases, the Company
may hold partial collateral, including letters of credit and funds held arrangements, for
these agreements. The Company establishes reserves for uncollectible balances based on
management’s assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding balances. To
minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables, the Company has a
reinsurance credit security committee that generally evaluates the financial strength of a
reinsurer prior to entering into a reinsurance arrangement. Additionally, creditworthy
foreign reinsurers of business written in the U.S. are generally required to secure their
obligations. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for the
Company’s uncollectible balances. Actual uncollectible amounts may vary, perhaps
substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change is
made. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Premiums Written and Earned.

Premiums written by the Company are earned ratably over the periods of the related
insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned premium reserves are established
to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period. Such reserves are established
based upon reports received from ceding companies or computed using pro rata methods based
on statistical data. Written and premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not
yet been reported to the Company are estimated and accrued. Because earned premium
generally correlates with the Company’s estimate of its exposure base, variations in
premium earnings are to a large degree offset by related variability in incurred losses
and commission expense. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Valuation.

The
Company’s investment portfolio consists of investments available for sale and
accordingly these securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis. Most securities
are traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available. The Company
holds some privately placed securities that are either valued by an investment advisor or
by the Company using cash flow projections. In addition, the Company owns interest only
strips that are accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20, which sets forth the rules
for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value due to
impairment. Unrealized gains and losses from market fluctuations are reflected as
comprehensive income, while market value declines that are considered other than temporary
impairments are reflected in the income statement as realized capital losses. The Company
considers many factors when determining whether a market value decline is other than
temporary, including: (1) the length of time the market value has been below book value,
(2) the credit strength of the issuer, (3) the issuer’s market sector, (4) the length
of time to maturity and (5) for interest only strips, increases in mortgage prepayments.
If management assessments change in the future, the Company may ultimately record a
realized loss after management originally concluded that the decline in value was
temporary. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Financial Condition

Cash and Invested Assets.

Aggregate invested assets, including cash and short-term investments, were $9,314.8
million at December 31, 2003, $7,259.1 million at December 31, 2002 and $5,783.5 million
at December 31, 2001. The increase in cash and invested assets in 2003 from 2002 resulted
primarily from $1,653.8 million in cash flows from operations generated during 2003,
$316.8 million of net proceeds from the offering of common shares in April 2003 and $68.1
million in net unrealized appreciation of the Company’s investments. The increase in
cash and invested assets in 2002 from 2001 resulted primarily from $736.1 million in cash
flows from operations generated in 2002, $346.3 million of net proceeds from the offering
of Group’s common shares in February 2002, $203.4 million of net proceeds from
Capital Trust’s issuance of trust preferred securities in November 2002 and $135.9
million in net unrealized appreciation of the Company’s investments. These increases
were partially offset by $35.0 million in net payments on the credit facility and $22.9
million in share repurchases.

The Company’s current investment
strategy generally seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified,
taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level
of liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is
adjusted continuously, consistent with its current and projected operating results, market
conditions and tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are
comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Commencing with the second quarter
of 2003, the Company invested in interest only strips of mortgage-backed securities. These
fixed maturity securities give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a
stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments on the
outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash
flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the mortgage
pool. Generally, as market interest rates and more specifically market mortgage rates
decline, mortgagees tend to refinance which will decrease the average life of a mortgage
pool and decrease expected cash flows. Conversely, as market interest rates and more
specifically market mortgage rates rise, repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows
will tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to increase as
general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These movements
are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the Company’s other
fixed income investments. The market value of the interest only strips was $310.2 million
at December 31, 2003. Additionally, the Company invests in equity securities, which it
believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio.

Loss and LAE Reserves.

Gross
loss and LAE reserves totaled $6,361.2 million at December 31, 2003, $4,905.6 million at
December 31, 2002, and $4,278.3 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in 2003 is
primarily attributable to increased premiums earned, net prior period reserve adjustments
in select areas and normal variability in claim settlements. The increase in 2002 was
primarily attributable to increased premiums earned, modest reserve strengthening in
select areas and normal variability in claim settlements. Reinsurance receivables totaled
$1,284.1 million at December 31, 2003, $1,116.4 million at December 31, 2002, and $895.1
million at December 31, 2001, with the changes in 2003 consisting of the increase in
reinsurance receivables reflecting an additional $85.0 million cession under the 2000
accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the Company’s corporate
retrocessional program and $81.1 million losses ceded as part of a reinsurance agreement
between Mt. McKinley and Prupac. At December 31, 2003, $494.5 million, or 38.5%, was
receivable from subsidiaries of London Reinsurance Group. These receivables are
effectively secured by a combination of letters of credit and funds held arrangements
under which the Company has retained the premium payments due the retrocessionaire,
recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced such liabilities as payments are due
from the retrocessionaire. In addition, $160.0 million or 12.5%, was receivable from
Prupac, whose obligations are guaranteed by The Prudential, $145.0 million, or 11.3%,
was receivable from Continental Insurance Company and $96.7 million, or 7.5% was receivable from Tranatlantic Reinsurance Company, which is partially secured by funds
held arrangements. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the
Company’s receivables.

Loss and LAE reserves net of
reinsurance recoverables (“net loss and LAE reserves”) totaled $5,100.1 million
at December 31, 2003, $3,817.0 million at December 31, 2002 and $3,394.8 million at
December 31, 2001. The following table summarizes net outstanding loss and LAE reserves by
segment and A&E reserves, which are managed on a combined basis, at December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001.


The increases by segment generally
reflect the increases in earned premium, changes in business mix and the impact of reserve
recalculations together with the claim settlement activity. The increases for A&E
reflect the impact of reserve re-evaluations and claim settlement activity.

The Company re-evaluates its loss and
LAE reserves on an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking
into consideration all available information and in particular newly reported loss and
claim experience. The effect of such re-evaluations impacts incurred losses for the
current period. While there can be no assurance that reserves for, and losses from, claim
obligations will not increase in the future, management believes that the Company’s
existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such
increase would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. In this context, the Company notes that over the past
10 years, its past calendar year operations have been affected variably by effects from
prior period reserve re-estimates with such effects ranging from a favorable $35.4
million, representing 1.2% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the
adjustment was made to an unfavorable ($256.9) million, representing 6.7% of the net prior
period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made.

The following table represents the
reserve levels and ranges as of December 31, 2003 for each of the Company’s business
segments.

Outstanding Reserves and Ranges By
Segment (1)

As of December 31, 2003

(1) There can be no assurances that reserves will not ultimately exceed the indicated ranges requiring additional incomestatement expense.

(3) Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management is unable to establish a range for these obligations.  As a result, which relate principally to the U.S. Reinsurance and Bermuda segments, have been segregated from reserves for which a range has been determined.

*  NA, not applicable

The Company has included ranges for
loss reserve estimates determined by the Company’s actuaries, which are derived
through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. Depending on the specific
segment, the range derived for the loss reserves, excluding reserves for A&E
exposures, ranges from minus 4.9% to minus 8.1% for the low range and from plus 6.5% to
plus 13.7% for the high range. The higher range is associated with the International
segment, and the lower range is associated with the Bermuda segment. Within each range,
management’s best estimate of loss reserves is based on the point estimate

derived by the Company’s actuaries in detailed reserve studies. Such ranges are
necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with
respect to their development. In particular, the Company notes that the width of the range
is dependent on the level of confidence associated with the outcome. For the above
presentation, management has assumed what it believes is a reasonable confidence level but
notes that there can be no assurance that the Company’s claim obligations will not
vary within and potentially outside of these ranges requiring incurred loss adjustments in
the period the variability is recognized. The Company is not able to establish a
meaningful range for A&E reserves.


Additional losses, including those
relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type
or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the Company, or the reinsurance and insurance
industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not
covered by existing retrocessional contracts, could have material adverse effects on the
Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Company generally has exposure to
A&E losses through its Mt. McKinley operation with respect to insurance policies and
through Everest Re with respect to reinsurance contracts. In each case, the Company’s
management and analysis of its exposures takes into account a number of features of its
business that differentiate the Company’s exposures from many other insurers and
reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures.

Mt.    
          McKinley began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and
          increased the volume of its writings in 1977. These writings ceased in 1984,
          giving Mt. McKinley an approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure,
          which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with
          significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and
          standardization of policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s
          to have been issued without aggregate limits on at least the product liability
          coverage offered; policies issued in earlier decades are generally more at risk
          of not having aggregate limits.

The vast majority of Mt.
McKinley’s A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies, with
aggregate coverage limits, which by definition also have protection afforded by underlying
coverage. Mt. McKinley’s attachment points vary but usually are protected by
millions, often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying coverage. The excess nature of
most of Mt. McKinley’s policies also offers protection against non-product claims
(for example, claims arising under general liability coverage). Although under some
circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non-product claims, such claims
generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non-product claims are generally
less likely to aggregate. In addition, environmental claims arise under general liability
coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these claims tend to create exposure for
primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies.

Virtually all of the Mt. McKinley
policies that are still potentially exposed to claims have policy language providing that
expenses were paid within limits rather than in addition to limits. This is a substantial
difference from primary coverage, which would most often cover expenses in addition to
limits.

Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was
not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under which A&E exposures
generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E exposures through
contract exclusions effected in 1984. Therefore, Everest Re has an approximate 11-year
window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many reinsurance companies that have
significant A&E exposures. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re was not
as heavily involved in casualty business as in property business, which generally is not
exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re generally took smaller lines of exposure per
contract than many other reinsurers operating in the casualty reinsurance market and those
lines were generally also smaller than the excess limits provided by Mt. McKinley
policies. This means that the potential adverse development on Everest Re’s
reinsurance business would not be subject to the same level of volatility as would be the
case for companies having greater exposures per risk. Everest Re reinsured both primary
and excess policies. However, its claim experience to date indicates that the majority of
its reinsurance supported excess policies. As a result, most of Everest Re’s exposure
derives from excess policies similar to those written by Mt. McKinley.


With respect to both the Mt. McKinley
and Everest Re operations, the Company was not a member of the Asbestos Claims Facility
(“Wellington”) or the Center for Claims Resolution (“CCR”) claim
settlement facilities. Insurers supporting those facilities made broad commitments
concerning the application of insurance coverage to asbestos claims. With respect to its
direct insurance exposures, the fact that the Company has not made those commitments may
allow it to resolve insurance exposure to Wellington/CCR insureds more economically than
if it had joined these facilities. With respect to its reinsurance exposures, although the
Company was not a signatory to the Wellington or CCR facilities, it has, within the bounds
of its reinsurance contracts, generally supported ceding companies that were signatories.
Because the insurers supporting these facilities have generally paid their exposures more
quickly than non-signatory insurers, the Company believes that this has generally meant
that it has paid its reinsurance exposure more quickly than it likely would have if it had
not been subject to Wellington/CCR payments.

The Company believes that its A&E
exposures are unique and differentiated from those insurers and reinsurers with
appreciable A&E exposure by the points noted above, but there can be no assurance that
such factors will protect the Company from adverse development, perhaps material, or allow
it to secure advantages in the settlement of its claims obligations.


The following table shows the
development of prior year A&E reserves on both a gross and net of retrocessional basis
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:

At December 31, 2003, the gross
reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $123.1 million representing case reserves
reported by ceding companies, $109.1 million representing additional case reserves
established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $251.3 million representing case
reserves established by the Company on direct excess insurance claims, including Mt.
McKinley, and $281.8 million representing reserves for IBNR.

The gross incurred losses for A&E
exposures increased by $172.6 million and $95.0 million for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. These increases are the result of re-evaluations by
management reflecting additional information received from insureds and ceding companies,
ongoing litigation, additional claims received and settlement activity. Management closely
monitors this additional information and adjusts reserves accordingly. The net incurred
losses primarily reflect the impact of the reinsurance agreement between Mt. McKinley and
Prupac.

Industry analysts have developed a
measurement, known as the survival ratio, to compare the A&E reserves among companies
with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a
company’s current net reserves by the three year average of paid losses, and
therefore measures the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves
based on historical payment patterns. Using this measurement, the Company’s net three
year A&E survival ratio was 8.3 years at December 31, 2003. Adjusting these ratios to
exclude the effect of the reinsurance ceded under the reinsurance agreement with Prupac,
the measures rise to the equivalent of 10.8 years at December 31, 2003. The cession of
$160.0 million to the stop loss reinsurance provided by Prupac in connection with the
acquisition of Mt. McKinley proceeds are not reflected in past net payments and
effectively extend the funding available for future net payments. Because the survival
ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and not of absolute
reserve adequacy, the Company considers, but does not rely on, the survival ratio when
evaluating its reserves.


Developments in 2003 and 2002
affecting asbestos exposures in general and the Company’s asbestos exposures in
particular, together with enhancements in the Company’s claim management and
analytical processes, resulted in the reserve strengthening noted earlier. These
developments and actions have increased the emphasis on asbestos exposures as a separate
component of the Company’s A&E exposures. Despite the Company’s approach of
handling A&E exposures on a combined basis, management believes additional disclosure
of the asbestos element of its A&E exposures is appropriate.

The following tables summarize
reserve and claim activity for asbestos claims, on both a gross and net of ceded
reinsurance basis, for the periods indicated with particular emphasis on the
differentiation of insured categories within the Mt. McKinley operation, which the Company
believes reflects the most volatile element of its asbestos exposures.

(1) Some totals may not
reconcile due to rounding.

(2) Under CIP agreements, payments depend upon the
insured’s actual claims           experience and may be subject to annual caps or
other controls on the rate of           payment. During 2003, one claim and corresponding
reserves were transferred from           high profiled insureds to CIP.

(3) Actively Managed means that Mt. McKinley is managing the defense of claims
          against the insured.

The Company’s net three year
survival ratio on its asbestos exposures was 9.8 years for the period ended December 31,
2003. This three year survival ratio when adjusted to exclude the effect of the
reinsurance ceded under the stop loss cover from Prupac was 13.6 years, and when adjusted
to exclude the CIP, actively managed reserves, and the stop loss cession to Prupac
was 23.8 years.

Shareholders’ Equity.

The
Company’s shareholders’ equity increased to $3,164.9 million as of December 31,
2003 from $2,368.6 million as of December 31, 2002, principally reflecting $426.0 million
of net income in 2003, $316.8 million in net proceeds from Group’s offering of 4.5
million common shares in April 2003, an increase of $36.4 million in net unrealized
appreciation of investments, and a $22.2 million increase in foreign currency translation,
partially offset by $19.6 million in shareholder dividends. The Company’s
shareholders’ equity increased to $2,368.6 million as of December 31, 2002 from
$1,720.5 million as of December 31, 2001, principally reflecting $346.3 million in net
proceeds from Group’s offering of 5.0 million common shares in February 2002, $231.3
million of net income in 2002 and an increase of $104.2 million in net unrealized
appreciation of investments, partially offset by $22.9 million in repurchases of 450,000
shares and $16.3 million in shareholder dividends. Dividends of $19.6 million, $16.3
million and $12.9 million were declared and paid by the Company in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. At December 31, 2003, 1.73 million shares remained under the existing
repurchase authorization.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Capital.

The Company’s business operations are in part dependent on the
          Company’s financial strength, and the market’s perception thereof, as
          measured by shareholders’ equity, which was $3,164.9 million and $2,368.6
          million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company has flexibility
          with respect to capitalization as the result of its perceived financial
          strength, including its financial strength ratings as assigned by independent
          rating agencies, and its access to the debt and equity markets. The Company
          continuously monitors its capital and financial position, as well as investment
          and security market conditions, both in general and with respect to the
          Company’s securities, and responds accordingly.


The Company filed a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that provides for the issuance of up to
$975 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group is
authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid
securities, Holdings is authorized to issue debt securities and Everest Re Capital Trust
II and III are authorized to issue trust preferred securities. The registration statement
was declared effective by the SEC on December 22, 2003.

On July 30, 2002, the Company filed a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance of up to
$475.0 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group
was authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and
hybrid securities, Holdings was authorized to issue debt securities and Capital Trust was
authorized to issue trust preferred securities. This shelf registration statement became
effective on September 26, 2002. The following securities were issued pursuant to that
registration statement.

o

In
November 2002, pursuant to a trust agreement between Holdings and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
the property trustee, and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, the Delaware trustee, Capital Trust
completed a public offering of $210.0 million of 7.85% trust preferred securities,
resulting in net proceeds of $203.4 million. The proceeds of the issuance were used to
purchase $210 million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities of Holdings that will
be held in trust by the property trustee for the benefit of the holders of the trust
preferred securities. Holdings used the proceeds from the sale of the junior subordinated
debt principally for capital contributions to its operating subsidiaries.

o

On
April 23, 2003, the Company expanded the size of the remaining shelf registration to $318
million by filing a Post-Effective Amendment under Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and General Instruction IV of Form S-3 promulgated there under. On the
same date, the Company issued 4,480,135 of its common shares at a price of $70.75 per
share, which resulted in $317.0 million in proceeds, before expenses of approximately
$0.2 million. This transaction effectively exhausted the September 26, 2002 shelf
registration.

Capital Trust will redeem all of the
outstanding trust preferred securities when the junior subordinated debt securities are
paid at maturity on November 15, 2032. Holdings may elect to redeem the junior
subordinated debt securities, in whole or in part, at any time after November 14, 2007. If
such an early redemption occurs, the outstanding trust preferred securities would also be
proportionately redeemed.

Distributions on the trust preferred
securities are cumulative and are paid quarterly in arrears. Distributions relating to the
trust preferred securities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $16.5
million and $2.1 million, respectively.

On November 7, 2001, the Company
filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance
of up to $575.0 million of common equity. On February 27, 2002, the Company completed an
offering of 5,000,000 of its common shares at a price of $69.25 per share, which resulted
in $346.3 million of proceeds before expenses of approximately $0.5 million related to the
offering. The Company has used the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate
purposes. On October 2, 2002, the Company filed a Post-Effective Amendment to this
registration statement that removed the remaining securities from registration.


On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed
public offerings of $200.0 million principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15,
2010 and $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due March 15, 2005. During
2000, the net proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were distributed by
Holdings to Group. Interest expense incurred in connection with these senior notes was
$38.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Liquidity

.    
          The Company’s current investment strategy generally seeks to maximize
          after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable bond and
          tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of
          liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is
          adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company’s current and projected
          operating results, market conditions and tax position. Additionally, the Company
          invests in equity securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted
          total return of the investment portfolio.

The Company’s liquidity
requirements are met on both a short and long-term basis by funds provided by premiums
collected, investment income, collected reinsurance receivable balances and the sale and
maturity of investments, together with the availability of funds under the Company’s
revolving credit facility. The Company’s net cash flows from operating activities
were $1,653.8 million at December 31, 2003, $736.1 million

for December 31, 2002
and $406.0 million for December 31, 2001. The increase in net cash flows from operations
for 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily due to the growth in business coupled with
favorable underwriting results. Additionally, these cash flows included net tax payments
of $52.6 million, $10.0 million and $24.9 million for December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively; catastrophe loss payments of $96.0 million, $62.0 million and $32.5 million
for December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and net derivative settlement payments
of $3.9 million, $39.5 million and $1.5 million for December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The increase in net cash flows from operations from 2002 to 2003 was
primarily due to the growth in business coupled with favorable underwriting results.

Management believes that net cash
flows from operating activities are generally consistent with expectations given the
Company’s large increase in premium volume and investment portfolio. Premiums are
generally collected over the policy period, which is typically one year. However, claims
related to the policies will be paid out over numerous years. This is particularly true
for casualty business. The Company is not able to predict how long this favorable premium
volume trend will be sustained.

In addition to its net cash flows
from operating activities, the Company’s investment portfolio, through normal
portfolio activities, provides substantial additional liquidity. Proceeds from sales,
calls and maturities and cost of investment asset acquisitions were $2,127.2 million and
$4,144.2 million, respectively, for December 31, 2003, compared to $2,822.1 million and
$3,929.7 million, respectively, for December 31, 2002 and $1,492.2 million and $1,767.4
million, respectively, for December 31, 2001.

Effective October 10, 2003, Holdings
entered into a new three year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of lenders, replacing the December 21, 1999, three year senior revolving credit
facility, which expired on December 19, 2003. Both the October 10, 2003 and December 21,
1999 senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the
“Credit Facility”. Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Credit
Facility. The Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general corporate purposes. The
Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with interest at a rate
selected by Holdings equal to either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an
adjusted London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin. The Base Rate is
the higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its
prime rate or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the
fees payable for the Credit Facility depend upon Holdings’ senior unsecured debt
rating.


The Credit Facility requires Holdings
to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1, Holdings to maintain a
minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its statutory
surplus at $1.0 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future
aggregate capital contributions. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance
with these covenants.

During the year ended December 31,
2003, Holdings made no payments on and had no borrowings under the Credit Facility. During
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, Holdings made payments on the Credit Facility
of $80.0 million and $152.0 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001, Holdings had new Credit Facility borrowings of $45.0 million and $22.0
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, Holdings had outstanding Credit
Facility borrowings of $70.0 million. Interest expense incurred in connection with these
borrowings was $1.4 million, $3.5 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Company’s cash flow activity
in 2003 included $317.0 million of new investable cash resulting from Group’s
offering of common shares in April. The cash flow activity in 2002 included $346.3 million
of new investable cash resulting from Group’s offering of common shares in February
and $210.0 million of new investable cash from Capital Trust’s issuance of trust
preferred securities in November.

The Company has arrangements
available for the issue of letters of credit, which letters are generally collateralized
by the Company’s cash or investments and which are generally used to collateralize
reinsurance assumed by Bermuda Re from jurisdictions where collateralization is generally
required for the ceding company to receive credit for such reinsurance recoverables from
its principal regulator. Bermuda Re and Everest International also used trust arrangements
to provide collateralization to ceding companies including affiliates. The Company
generally avoids providing collateral except where required for ceding companies to
receive credit from their regulators. At December 31, 2003, $246.2 million of letters of
credit were issued and outstanding under these arrangements and substantially all were
related to Bermuda Re and Everest Re’s U.K. branch. Additionally, at December 31,
2003, $254.0 million of assets were deposited in trust accounts.

Exposure to Catastrophes.

As
with other reinsurers, the Company’s operating results and financial condition can be
adversely affected by volatile and unpredictable natural and other disasters, such as
hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions. Any such catastrophic
event could generate insured losses in one or many of the Company’s treaties or lines
of business, including property and/or casualty exposures. Although the Company attempts
to limit its exposure to acceptable levels, including through the purchase of reinsurance
when considered to be cost effective, it is possible that an actual catastrophic event or
multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.


The Company employs various
techniques, including licensed software modeling, to assess its accumulated exposure. Such
techniques are inherently more difficult to apply to non-property exposures. Accumulated
exposures with respect to catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the
probable maximum loss (“PML”). The Company defines PML as its anticipated
maximum loss, taking into account contract limits, caused by a single catastrophe
affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or
earthquake of such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in every 100 years.

Management believes that the
Company’s greatest catastrophe exposure world wide from any single event is to a
European windstorm where the Company estimates it has a pre-tax PML exposure of $430
million. The Company further estimates that its greatest pre-tax U.S. PML exposure, which relates to an earthquake affecting the west coast, including workers’ compensation exposure is $404 million. The second largest U.S.
exposure relates to a hurricane affecting the east coast with a PML of $302 million. There
can be no assurance that the Company will not experience losses from one or more
catastrophic events that exceed, perhaps by a substantial amount, its estimated PML.

The Company employs a retrocessional
approach under which the Company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business
written or exposure accumulations or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering
the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the
Company’s operations. All reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the
potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing, terms, conditions
and availability of such coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective protection. The
level of reinsurance coverage varies over time, reflecting the underwriter’s and/or
Company’s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the
reinsurance markets.

If a single catastrophe were to occur
that resulted in $430 million of gross losses and ALAE in 2004 (an amount equivalent to
the Company’s PML including its property and workers’ compensation exposures),
management estimates that the effect on the Company’s income before and after taxes
would be approximately $430 million and $335 million, respectively. Such impact represents
approximately 10.6% of the Company’s beginning of year capital.

For 2002, 2003 and thus far in 2004,
the Company has chosen not to purchase corporate retrocessional protection and to
generally de-emphasize the purchase of specific reinsurance by its underwriters reflecting
the Company’s view that its exposures in the context of its capital and financial
position do not warrant reinsurance purchases at current price levels. For 1999, 2000 and
2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage,
which provided up to $175.0 million of recoveries per accident year if Everest Re’s
consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment
point provided in the contract for the respective accident years. Each arrangement
provided for an adjustment premium, which reduces the net benefit by approximately 50%, in
the event that the coverage is used. There are no remaining limits available under these
coverages. See ITEM 1,  “Business — Risk Management and Retrocession
Arrangements” for further details.


Contractual  Obligations.  The
 following  table shows the  Company's  contractual  obligations  for the year ended
December 31, 2003:

The majority of these contractual
obligations are the responsibility of Holdings. While the Company has sufficient cash
flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to settle these obligations,
Holdings is dependent upon dividends from Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary,
capital contributions from Group or access to the capital markets for funding. Management
is of the opinion that financial resources are or will be readily available to settle
these obligations.

Dividends

During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the
Company declared and paid shareholder dividends of $19.6 million, $16.3 million and $12.9
million, respectively. As an insurance holding company, the Company is partially dependent
on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to
its shareholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest
Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by
Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. Management expects
that, absent significant catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest
Re’s ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Holdings’
general corporate needs and Holdings’ and Bermuda Re’s ability to declare and
pay dividends sufficient to support Group’s general corporate needs. For the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Everest Re paid dividends to Holdings of $45
million, $85 million and $115 million, respectively to Holdings. See ITEM 1,
“Business – Regulatory Matters – Dividends” and Note 14A of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Market Sensitive
Instruments

The SEC’s Financial Reporting
Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial
statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative
commodity instruments, and other financial instruments (collectively, “market
sensitive instruments”). The Company does not enter into market sensitive instruments
for trading purposes.

The Company’s current investment
strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable
and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of
liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted
continuously, consistent with its current and projected operating results, market
conditions, and the Company’s tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment
portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, the
Company invests in equity securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted
total return of the investment portfolio. The Company has also engaged in a small number
of credit default swaps and specialized equity options.


The overall investment strategy
considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular,
estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability
transactions, together with the Company’s capital structure and other factors, are
used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout
characteristics for which the investments of the Company provide liquidity. This analysis
is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation,
duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure
principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the year, including the
acquisition of interest only strips in which market value increases as interest rates rise
and decreases as interest rates fall. The addition of these securities to the portfolio
has reduced the impact of interest rate shift on the entire portfolio.

The Company’s $9,314.8 million
investment portfolio is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities that are
subject to interest rate risk and foreign currency rate risk, and equity securities that
are subject to equity price risk. The impact of these risks on the investment portfolio is
generally mitigated by changes in the value of operating assets and liabilities and their
associated income statement impact.

Interest rate risk is the potential
change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, due to
change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, it includes
prepayment risk on the $1,383.3 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $8,726.9
million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated
principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the
security.

The tables below display the
potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on the
fixed maturity portfolio as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 based on parallel 200 basis
point shifts in interest rates up and down in 100 basis point increments. For legal
entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each
security individually. To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed
securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments
are taken into account. For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the
effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the
market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios. All amounts are in
U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. In general, the reduced volatility is
attributable to the Company’s investments in interest only strips, the effect of
which was to reduce overall portfolio duration and therefore sensitivity to interest rate
moves.


Foreign currency rate risk is the
potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. Each of the Company’s foreign operations maintains capital
in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory
guidelines. Generally, the Company prefers to maintain the capital of its foreign
operations in U.S. dollar assets, although this varies by regulatory jurisdiction in
accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation may conduct business in its local
currency as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates. The primary
foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the Canadian Dollar, the
British Pound Sterling and the Euro. The Company mitigates foreign exchange exposure by a
general matching of the currency and duration of its assets to its corresponding operating
liabilities. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52, the
Company translates the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional
currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a
component of other comprehensive income. The primary functional foreign currency exposures
for these foreign operations are the Canadian Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound
Sterling.

The tables below display the
potential impact of a parallel 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the
valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure in 10% increments as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002. This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation
from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of
translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. The growth in
exposure between 2003 and 2002 principally arises from increases in the level of foreign
currency investments, which are generally commensurate with changes in the Company’s
mix of business. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions.

Equity risk is the potential change
in market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios arising from changing
equity prices. The Company invests in high quality common and preferred stocks that are
traded on the major exchanges in the U.S. and funds investing in such securities. The
primary objective in managing the equity portfolio is to provide long-term capital growth
through market appreciation and income.

The tables below display the impact
on market value and after-tax unrealized appreciation of a 20% change in equity prices up
and down in 10% increments as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. The growth in exposure is
primarily due to the growth in the equity portfolio. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and
are presented in millions.

Although not considered material in
the context of the Company’s aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments, the
Company has issued five specialized equity put options based on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”) index that are market sensitive and sufficiently
unique to warrant supplemental disclosure.


During 2001, the Company sold five
specialized equity put options based on the S&P 500 index for total consideration, net
of commission, of $16.9 million. These contracts each have a single exercise date, with
maturities ranging from 18 to 30 years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to
$1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is at
or above the strike price on the exercise dates. If the S&P 500 index is lower than
the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately
with the percentage the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index
volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2003 index value, the Company estimates the
probability for each contract of the S&P 500 index being below the strike price on the
exercise date is less than 4.4%. The theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would
occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P 500 index value were zero.

As these specialized equity put
options are derivatives within the framework of FAS 133, the Company is required to report
the fair value of these instruments on its balance sheet and record any changes to fair
value in its statement of operations. The Company has recorded fair values for its
obligations on these specialized equity put options at December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002 of $16.5 million and $22.4 million, respectively; however, the Company does not
believe that the ultimate settlement of these transactions is likely to require a payment
that would exceed the initial consideration received or any payment at all.

As there is no active market for
these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted
option-pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions, including those regarding
volatility and expected rates of return.

The table below estimates the impact
of potential movements in interest rates and the S&P 500 index, which are the
principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair
value at December 31, 2003 and 2002. These are estimates and there can be no assurances
regarding future market performance. The asymmetrical results of the interest rate and
S&P 500 index shifts reflect that the liability cannot fall below zero whereas it can
increase to its theoretical maximum.

This report contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. The Company intends
these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for
forward-looking statements in the federal securities laws. In some cases, these statements
can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as “may”,
“will”, “should”, “could”, “anticipate”,
“estimate”, “expect”, “plan”, “believe”,
“predict”, “potential” and “intend”. Forward-looking
statements contained in this report include information regarding the Company’s
reserves for losses and LAE, the adequacy of the Company’s provision for
uncollectible balances, estimates of the Company’s catastrophe exposure, the effects
of catastrophic events on the Company’s financial statements, the ability of Everest
Re, Holdings and Bermuda Re to pay dividends and the settlement costs of the
Company’s specialized equity put options. Forward-looking statements only reflect the
Company’s expectations and are not guarantees of performance. These statements

materially from the Company’s expectations. Important factors that could cause actual
events or results to be materially different from the Company’s expectations include
those discussed below under the caption “Risk Factors”. The Company undertakes
no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Risk Factors

The following risk factors, in
addition to the other information provided in this report, should be considered when
evaluating the Company. If the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors
materialize, the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of the Company’s
common shares could decline significantly.

Risks Relating to the
Company’s Business

The Company’s results could
be adversely affected by catastrophic events.

Like all insurance and reinsurance
companies, the Company is exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events, including
weather-related and other natural catastrophes, as well as war and acts of terrorism. Any
material reduction in the Company’s operating results caused by the occurrence of one
or more catastrophes could inhibit its ability to pay dividends or to meet its interest
and principal payment obligations. The Company defines a catastrophe as an event that
causes a pre-tax loss on property exposures of at least $5.0 million and has an event date
of January 1, 1998 or later. By way of illustration, during the past five calendar years,
pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under
corporate reinsurance programs, were as follows:

Calendar year

Pre-tax catastrophe losses


$45.9 million


$13.9 million


$222.6 million


$30.2 million


$36.8 million

If the Company’s loss
reserves are inadequate to meet its actual losses, net income would be reduced or it could
incur a loss.

The Company is required to maintain
reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses
for both reported and unreported claims incurred. These reserves are only estimates of
what the Company believes the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on
facts and circumstances known to it. In setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities,
the Company relies on claim data supplied by its ceding companies and brokers. This
information is not always timely or accurate and can result in inaccurate loss
projections. Because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves and LAE,
the Company cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of
losses and loss adjustment reserves. If the Company’s reserves are insufficient to
cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, the Company would have to augment
its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings. These charges could be material. By way
of illustration, during the past five calendar years, the reserve re-estimation process
affected the Company’s net income in the following manner:


Calendar year

Effect on pre-tax net income


$35.4 million increase


$7.8 million decrease


no change


$140.1 million decrease


$256.9 million decrease

See ITEM 1, “Business —
Changes in Historical Reserves,” which provides a more detailed chart showing the
effect of reserve re-estimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years.

The difficulty in estimating the
Company’s reserves is increased because loss reserves include reserves for potential
A&E liabilities. A&E liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons,
including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury
or property damage, difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental
contamination, long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for
the asbestos or environmental damage. Legal tactics and judicial and legislative
developments affecting the scope of insurers’ liability, which can be difficult to
predict, also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for A&E liabilities.

The failure to accurately assess
underwriting risk could reduce the Company’s net income or increase the
Company’s net loss.

The Company’s success depends on
its ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the
risk is retained. If the Company fails to accurately assess the risks it retains, it may
fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover its losses and LAE. This could reduce
the Company’s net income and even result in an operating loss. Losses may arise from
events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced. An example of an
unanticipated event is the September 11 attacks. The Company’s loss from those
attacks, after reinsurance and taxes, was $75 million. Neither the magnitude of loss on a
single line of business nor the combined impact on several lines of business from an act
of terrorism on such a large scale was contemplated when the Company priced its coverages.
In addition to unanticipated events, the Company also faces the unanticipated expansion of
its exposures, particularly in long-tail liability lines. An example of this is the
ongoing expansion of the scope of insurers’ legal liability for A&E exposures
discussed above.

Decreases in pricing for property
and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce the Company’s net income.

The Company writes primarily property
and casualty reinsurance and insurance. The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses
are highly competitive, yet cyclical by product and market. These cycles, as well as other
business, economic and societal trends that influence aggregate supply and demand for
property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products, are outside of the
Company’s control. The phase of the industry cycle that prevailed from 1987 through
1999 was characterized by increasingly competitive global market conditions across most
lines of business, leading to decreasing prices and broadening contract terms, which in
turn had a negative impact on insurers’ financial results and eroded the industry
capital base. These trends resulted from a number of factors, including the emergence of
significant reinsurance capacity in Bermuda, changes in the Lloyd’s market,
consolidation and increased capital levels in the insurance and reinsurance industries and
the emergence of new reinsurance and financial products addressing traditional exposures
in alternative fashions. This industry cycle began to reverse in 2000, when the industry
entered a period of firming prices, more restrictive terms and conditions and tightened
coverage availability across most classes and markets. These new trends were intensified
and accelerated by losses from the September 11 attacks, which reduced industry capacity
and were of sufficient magnitude to cause most insurers to reassess their capital
position, tolerance for risk, exposure control mechanisms and the pricing terms and
conditions at which they are willing to take on risk. Additional contributing factors
included deteriorating investment market conditions and results and renewed concerns
regarding longer-term industry-specific issues, such as A&E exposures. Although the
industry is currently in a favorable phase of the pricing cycle, the Company cannot assure
that this favorable phase will continue. Many of the factors that contributed to
decreasing prices during the prior phase of the cycle continue to exist and new and
unanticipated factors could emerge. Any significant decrease in pricing for property and
casualty insurance or reinsurance could reduce the Company’s ability to write
business profitably and reduce its net income. Further discussion of competition issues
can be found in ITEM 1, “Business – Competition”.


If rating agencies downgrade their
ratings of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries, future prospects for growth and
profitability could be significantly and adversely affected.

The Company’s insurance company
subsidiaries, other than Mt. McKinley and Everest International, currently hold an
“A+ (“Superior”)” financial strength rating from A.M. Best. Everest
Re, Bermuda Re and Everest National hold an “AA– (“Very
Strong”)” financial strength rating from Standard & Poor’s. Everest Re
and Bermuda Re hold an “Aa3 (“Excellent”)” financial strength
rating from Moody’s Financial strength ratings are used by insurers and reinsurance
and insurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and
quality of reinsurers. In addition, an unfavorable rating or the lack of a rating of its
reinsurers may adversely affect the rating of a company purchasing reinsurance. A
downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect, the Company’s
ability to market its insurance products and could have a material and adverse effect on
future prospects for growth and profitability. During the last five years, no active
subsidiary of the Company has experienced a credit rating downgrade. However, the Company
cannot assure that no credit downgrade will ever occur in the future. Consistent with
market practice, roughly 20% to 30% of the Company’s treaty reinsurance business
allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of the
Company’s obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold.
The termination provision would generally be triggered only if a rating fell below A.M.
Best’s A- rating level, which is three levels below Everest Re’s current rating
of A+. Everest Re also has more modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain
provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating
agency downgrade. That provision would also generally be triggered only if Everest
Re’s rating fell below A.M. Best’s A- rating level.

The Company’s
reinsurers may not satisfy their obligations.

The Company is subject to credit risk
with respect to its reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not
relieve it of its liability to the insured. In addition, reinsurers may be unwilling to
pay the Company even though they are able to do so. The failure of one or more of the
Company’s reinsurers to honor their obligations to it in a timely fashion would
impact its cash flow and reduce its net income and could cause it to incur a significant
loss.


If the Company is unable or
chooses not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers, its net income could
be reduced or it could incur a net loss in the event of an unusual loss experience.

The Company is generally less reliant
on the purchase of reinsurance than many of its competitors, in part because of its
strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in its
business. The Company tries to separate its risk taking process from its risk mitigation
process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance. Thus, the
Company generally evaluates, underwrites, selects and prices its products prior to
consideration of reinsurance. However, the Company’s underwriters generally consider
purchasing reinsurance with respect to specific insurance contracts or programs, and its
senior management generally considers purchasing reinsurance with respect to its overall
operations, where reinsurance is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or is
expected to have a positive cost/benefit relationship. Since the Company generally
purchases reinsurance only when it expects a net benefit, the percentage of business that
it reinsures, as indicated in the chart below, varies considerably from year to year,
depending on its view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the
contract period.






Percentage of ceded

written premiums to

gross written premiums

5.6%

7.3%

16.8%

12.0%

4.1%

Changes in the availability and cost
of reinsurance, which are subject to market conditions that are outside of the
Company’s control, have thus reduced to some extent its ability to use reinsurance to
tailor the risks it assumes on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance
exposures across its reinsurance operations. Because the Company has reduced its level of
reinsurance purchases, its net income could be reduced in the event of a large unreinsured
event or adverse overall experience.

The Company’s industry is
highly competitive and it may not be able to compete successfully in the future.

The Company’s industry is highly
competitive and has experienced significant price competition over most of the last
decade. In addition, a number of new well-capitalized competitors have entered the market
recently, and the Company expects to face further competition from new market entrants in
the future. The Company competes globally in the U.S., Bermuda and other international
markets. According to the 2003 edition of Standard & Poor’s special report on the
global reinsurance industry, there are 240 reinsurance organizations operating worldwide,
from 41 countries. Market share is largely concentrated within the top 25 groups, one of
which is the Company. The Company considers the 15 groups that have financial strength
ratings generally comparable to or above it’s rating to be its primary competitors.
The leaders in this market are Munich Re, Swiss Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Hannover Re and
Employers Re. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the Company
does, have been operating for longer than the Company has and have established long-term
and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, any of which can be a
significant competitive advantage. In addition, the Company expects to face further
competition in the future and may not be able to compete successfully in the future.


The Company is dependent
on its key personnel.

The Company’s success has been,
and will continue to be, dependent on the ability to retain the services of existing key
executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future.
The loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain
other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect the ability of the
Company to conduct business. Generally, the Company considers key executive officers to be
those individuals who have the greatest influence in setting overall policy and
controlling operations: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph V. Taranto (age 55),
President and Chief Operating Officer, Thomas J. Gallagher (age 55), and Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer, Stephen L. Limauro (age 52). Of those three
officers, the Company only has an employment contract with Mr. Taranto. That contract has
been previously filed with the SEC and was most recently amended on April 18, 2003 to
extend Mr. Taranto’s term of employment from March 31, 2004 until March 31, 2006. The
Company is not aware that any of the above three officers are planning to leave the
company or retire in the near future. The Company does not maintain any key employee
insurance on any of its employees.

Special considerations apply to the
Company’s Bermuda operations. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians, other than spouses
of Bermudians and individuals holding permanent resident certificates, are not permitted
to engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without a work permit issued by the Bermuda
government. A work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that, after
a proper public advertisement, no Bermudian, spouse of a Bermudian or individual holding a
permanent resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards for the
position. The Bermuda government has announced a policy that places a six-year term limit
on individuals with work permits, subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be
key employees. Currently, all four of the Company’s Bermuda-based professional
employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the Bermuda government
that expire at various times between July 2004 and May 2006. This includes Peter J.
Bennett, the chief executive officer of the Company’s Bermuda reinsurance operation.
In the event his work permit were not renewed, the Company could lose his services,
thereby adversely affecting its ability to conduct its business in Bermuda until it was
able to replace him with an individual in Bermuda who did not require a work permit or who
was granted the permit.

The value of the Company’s
investment portfolio and the investment income it receives from that portfolio could
decline as a result of market fluctuations and economic conditions.

A significant portion of the
Company’s investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and a smaller
portion consists of equity securities. Both the fair market value of these assets and the
investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market
conditions. For example, the fair market value of the Company’s fixed income
securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations
in interest rates. The fair market value of its fixed income securities can also decrease
as a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of those
securities to deteriorate. The net investment income that the Company realizes from future
investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest
rates. Interest rate fluctuations also can cause net investment income from investments
that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, to
differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase. In
addition, if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations,
investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise. Because all of
the Company’s securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the market
value of its securities are reflected in its financial statements. Similar treatment is
not available for liabilities. As a result, a decline in the value of the securities in
the Company’s portfolio could reduce its net income or cause it to incur a loss. The
following table quantifies the portion of the Company’s investment portfolio that
consists of fixed income securities, equity securities and investments that carry
prepayment risk.


Further discussion of
market-sensitive instruments can be found in ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Market Sensitive
Instruments”.

The Company may
experience foreign currency exchange losses.

The Company’s functional
currency is the U.S. dollar. However, the Company writes a portion of its business in
currencies other than U.S. dollars. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company
wrote approximately 26.1% of its reinsurance coverages in currencies other than U.S.
dollars. The Company also maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in investments
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2003, the Company
maintained approximately 11% of its investment portfolio in investments denominated in
currencies other than U.S. dollars. Consequently, quarterly exchange rate fluctuations may
have a material impact on the Company’s quarterly net income. During 2003, 2002,
2001, the impact on the Company’s quarterly pre-tax net income from exchange rate
fluctuations ranged from a loss of $3.6 million to a gain of $7.8 million. Further
discussion of foreign currency rate risk can be found in ITEM 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Market
Sensitive Instruments”.


Risks Relating to
Regulation

Insurance laws and regulations
restrict the Company’s ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws
and regulations could have a material adverse effect on its business.

The Company is subject to extensive
regulation under U.S., state and foreign insurance laws. These laws limit the amount of
dividends that can be paid to the Company by its operating subsidiaries, impose
restrictions on the amount and type of investments that the Company can hold, prescribe
solvency standards that must be met and maintained and require the Company to maintain
reserves. These laws also require disclosure of material intercompany transactions and
require prior approval of “extraordinary” transactions. These
“extraordinary” transactions include declaring dividends from operating
subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds. These laws also generally require approval
of changes of control of insurance companies. The application of these laws could affect
the Company’s liquidity and ability to pay dividends, interest and other payments on
securities, as applicable, and could restrict the ability to expand business operations
through acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries. In addition, the Company cannot assure
that it will have or can maintain all required licenses and approvals or that its business
fully complies with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant
authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations. If the Company does not have
the requisite licenses and approvals or does not comply with applicable regulatory
requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend
the Company from carrying on some or all activities or monetarily penalize the Company.
These types of actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business. To date, no material fine, penalty or restriction has been imposed on the
Company for failure to comply with any insurance law or regulation.

Regulatory challenges in the U.S.
could adversely affect the ability of Bermuda Re to conduct business.

Bermuda Re does not intend to be
licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any U.S. jurisdiction. Under current
law, Bermuda Re generally will be permitted to reinsure U.S. risks from its office in
Bermuda without obtaining those licenses. However, the insurance and reinsurance
regulatory framework has become subject to increased scrutiny. In the past, there have
been congressional and other initiatives in the U.S. regarding increased supervision and
regulation of the insurance industry, including proposals to supervise and regulate
reinsurers domiciled outside the U.S.  If Bermuda Re were to become subject to any
insurance laws of the U.S. or any U.S. state at any time in the future, it might be
required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from
engaging in lines of business or from writing types of policies. Complying with those laws
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to conduct business in
the Bermuda market.


Bermuda Re may need to be licensed
or admitted in additional jurisdictions to develop its business.

As Bermuda Re’s business
develops, it will monitor the need to obtain licenses in jurisdictions other than Bermuda
in order to comply with applicable law or to be able to engage in additional
insurance-related activities. In addition, Bermuda Re may be at a competitive disadvantage
in jurisdictions where it is not licensed or does not enjoy an exemption from licensing
relative to competitors that are so licensed or exempt from licensing. Bermuda Re may not
be able to obtain any additional licenses that it determines are necessary or desirable.
Furthermore, the process of obtaining those licenses is often costly and may take a long
time.

Bermuda Re’s ability to write
reinsurance may be severely limited if it is unable to arrange for security to back its
reinsurance.

Many jurisdictions do not permit
insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or
non-admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements without appropriate
security. Bermuda Re’s reinsurance clients typically require it to post a letter of
credit or enter into other security arrangements. If Bermuda Re is unable to obtain or
maintain a letter of credit facility on commercially acceptable terms or is unable to
arrange for other types of security, its ability to operate its business may be severely
limited. If Bermuda Re defaults on any letter of credit that it obtains, it may be
required to prematurely liquidate a substantial portion of its investment portfolio and
other assets pledged as collateral.

Risks Relating to the
Company’s Securities

Because of the Company’s
holding company structure, its ability to pay dividends, interest and principal is
dependent on its receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its
subsidiaries.

The Company and Holdings are holding
companies, each of whose most significant assets consists of the stock of their operating
subsidiaries. As a result, each of the Company’s and Holdings’ ability to pay
dividends, interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the
earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries
to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it. This ability is subject to general
economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond the Company’s
control. Payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating
subsidiaries are regulated by U.S., state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory
restrictions, including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. Accordingly, the
operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to the
Company and Holdings in the future, which could prevent it from paying dividends, interest
or other payments on its securities.

Provisions in the Company’s
bye-laws could have an anti-takeover effect, which could diminish the value of its common
shares.

The Company’s bye-laws contain
provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to
replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In addition,
these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might
consider favorable. The effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from
receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered
by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change
in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing
market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in
the future.


For example, the Company’s
bye-laws contain the following provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect:

•

election
of directors is staggered, meaning that the members of only one of three classes of
directors are selected each year;

•

shareholders
have limited ability to remove directors;

•

the
total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 9.9% of the common shares will be
reduced to 9.9% of the total voting power of the common shares;

•

the
board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has reason
to believe that the transfer would result in:

•

any
person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more than 5.0% of any class
of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company,

•

any
person holding controlled shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the issued and
outstanding share capital of the Company, or

•

any
adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to the                    Company,   any of
its subsidiaries or any of its shareholders;

•

the
Company also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholder’s
common shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or
advisable to avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if:

•

any
person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than 5.0% of any class of
the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company,

•

any
person holds  controlled  shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the issued and
outstanding                   share capital of the Company, or

•

share
ownership by any person may result in adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to
the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder.

Applicable insurance laws
may also have an anti-takeover effect.

Before a person can acquire control
of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance
commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled. Prior to granting
approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company, a state
insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the
applicant, the integrity and competence of the applicant’s board of directors and
executive officers, the acquiror’s plans for changes to the insurance company’s
board of directors and executive officers, the acquiror’s plans for the future
operations of the insurance company and any anti-competitive results that may arise from
the consummation of the acquisition of control. Because any person who acquired control of
the Company would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries
in the U.S., the insurance change of control laws of Delaware, Arizona, California and
Georgia would apply to such a transaction. This could have the effect of delaying or even
preventing such a change of control.


Investors  in the  Company  may have
more  difficulty  in  protecting  their  interests  than  investors  in a U.S.
corporation.

The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda
(the “Companies Act”), differs in material respects from the laws applicable to
U.S. corporations and their shareholders. The following is a summary of material
differences between the Companies Act, as modified in some instances by provisions of the
Company’s bye-laws, and Delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for
investors in the Company to protect their interests than investors in a U.S. corporation.
Because the following statements are summaries, they do not address all aspects of Bermuda
law that may be relevant to the Company and its shareholders.

Alternate
Directors.

The Company’s bye-laws provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that each
director may appoint an alternate director, who shall have the power to attend and vote at
any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not
personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director. Delaware law
does not provide for alternate directors.

Committees
of the Board of Directors.

The Company’s bye-laws provide, as permitted by
Bermuda law, that the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that
the board appoints, and those committees may consist partly or entirely of non-directors.
Delaware law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers
to committees, but those committees may consist only of directors.

Interested
Directors.

Bermuda law and the Company’s bye-laws provide that if a director has
a personal interest in a transaction to which the company is also a party and if the
director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity, either
at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors, then the company will not be
able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest
and the director will not be liable to the Company for any profit realized from the
transaction. In addition, after a director has made the declaration of interest referred
to above, he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum
is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest, unless
disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting. Under Delaware
law, a corporation may be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be
void unless one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

•

the
material facts as to the interested director’s relationship or interests are
disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes
the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors,

•

the
material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the
transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of
a majority of the voting shares or

•

the
transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or
ratified.


Under Delaware law, an interested
director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director derived an improper
personal benefit.

Transactions
with Significant Shareholders.

As a Bermuda company, the Company may enter into
business transactions with its significant shareholders, including asset sales, in which a
significant shareholder receives, or could receive, a financial benefit that is greater
than that received, or to be received, by other shareholders with prior approval from
the Company’s board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the
shareholders. In the case of an amalgamation, in which two or more companies join together
and continue as a single company, a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of
at least 75% of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of
directors, except in the case of an amalgamation with and between wholly-owned
subsidiaries. If the Company were a Delaware corporation, any business combination with an
interested shareholder (which, for this purpose, would include mergers and asset sales of
greater than 10% of the Company’s assets that would otherwise be considered
transactions in the ordinary course of business) within a period of three years from the
time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval from
shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the Company’s outstanding common shares not
owned by the interested shareholder, unless the transaction qualified for one of the
exemptions in the relevant Delaware statute or the Company opted out of the statute. For
purposes of the Delaware statute, an “interested shareholder” is generally
defined as a person who together with that person’s affiliates and associates owns,
or within the previous three years did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s
outstanding voting shares.

Takeovers.

Under Bermuda law, if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and,
          within four months of the offer, the holders of not less than 90% of the shares
          that are the subject of the offer tender their shares, the acquiror may give the
          nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the
          terms of the offer. Within one month of receiving the notice, dissenting
          shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer. The burden is on
          the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its
          discretion to enjoin the transfer. The court will be unlikely to do this unless
          there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and
          the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders.
          Under another provision of Bermuda law, the holders of 95% of the shares of a
          company (the “acquiring shareholders”) may give notice to the
          remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms
          described in the notice. Within one month of receiving the notice, dissenting
          shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their shares. Within one
          month of the court’s appraisal, the acquiring shareholders are entitled
          either to acquire all shares involved at the price fixed by the court or cancel
          the notice given to the remaining shareholders. If shares were acquired under
          the notice at a price below the court’s appraisal price, the acquiring
          shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and
          return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder, who must then refund the
          purchase price. There are no comparable provisions under Delaware law.

Inspection
of Corporate Records.

Members of the general public have the right to inspect the
public documents of the Company available at the office of the Registrar of Companies and
the Company’s registered office, both in Bermuda. These documents include the
memorandum of association, which describes the Company’s permitted purposes and
powers, any amendments to the memorandum of association and documents relating to any
increase or reduction in the Company’s authorized share capital. Shareholders of the
Company have the additional right to inspect the Company’s bye-laws, minutes of
general meetings of shareholders and audited financial statements that must be presented
to the annual general meeting of shareholders. The register of shareholders of the Company
also is open to inspection by shareholders without charge, and to members of the public
for a fee. the Company is required to maintain its share register at its registered office
in Bermuda. The Company also maintains a branch register in the offices of its transfer
agent in the U.S., which is open for public inspection as required under the Companies Act. The Company is required to keep at its registered office a
register of its directors and officers that is open for inspection by members of the
public without charge. However, Bermuda law does not provide a general right for
shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records. Under Delaware
law, any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporation’s shareholder list
and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that person’s
interest as a shareholder.


Shareholder’s
Suits.

The rights of shareholders under Bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights
of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many U.S. jurisdictions. Class
actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws
of Bermuda. However, the Bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow English
case law precedent, which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of the
Company to remedy a wrong done to the Company where the act complained of is alleged to be
beyond the corporate power of the Company or illegal or would result in the violation of
the Company’s memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, the court would
give consideration to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority
shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the
Company’s shareholders than actually approved it. The winning party in an action of
this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys’ fees incurred in
connection with the action. Under Delaware law, class actions and derivative actions
generally are available to stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and
actions not taken in accordance with applicable law. In these types of actions, the court
has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys’ fees.

Limitation
of Liability of Directors and Officers

. the Company’s bye-laws provide that the
Company and its shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have,
individually or in the right of the Company, against any director or officer for any act
or failure to act in the performance of that director’s or officer’s duties.
However, this waiver does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud
or dishonesty. This waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under U.S.
federal securities laws. Under Delaware law, a corporation may include in its certificate
of incorporation provisions limiting the personal liability of its directors to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary
duty. However, these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of
loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, the authorization of unlawful dividends, stock repurchases or
stock redemptions, or any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal
benefit. Moreover, these provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under U.S.
federal securities laws.

Indemnification
of Directors and Officers.

the Company’s bye-laws provide that the Company shall
indemnify its directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all
actions, costs, charges, liabilities, loss, damage or expense incurred or suffered by them
by reason of any act done, concurred in or omitted in the conduct of the Company’s
business or in the discharge of their duties. Under Bermuda law, this indemnification may
not extend to any matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may
be guilty in relation to the company, as determined in a final judgment or decree not
subject to appeal. Under Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer
who becomes a party to an action, suit or proceeding because of his position as a director
or officer if (1) the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and
(2) if the action or proceeding involves a criminal offense, the director or officer had
no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.


Enforcement
of Civil Liabilities.

The Company is organized under the laws of Bermuda. Some of its
directors and officers may reside outside the U.S. A substantial portion of the
Company’s assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. A person may
not be able to effect service of process within the U.S. on directors and officers of the
Company and those experts who reside outside the U.S. A person also may not be able to
recover against them or the Company on judgments of U.S. courts or to obtain original
judgments against them or the Company in Bermuda courts, including judgments predicated
upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.

Dividends.

Bermuda law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend, or make a
          distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for
          believing that the company, after the payment is made, would be unable to pay
          its liabilities as they become due, or that the realizable value of the
          company’s assets would be less, as a result of the payment, than the
          aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium
          accounts. The share capital account represents the aggregate par value of the
          company’s issued shares, and the share premium account represents the
          aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value. Under
          Delaware law, subject to any restrictions contained in the company’s
          certificate of incorporation, a company may pay dividends out of the surplus or,
          if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the
          dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Surplus is the amount by
          which the net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital. Delaware law
          also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time when
          stated capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of
          all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets.

Risks Relating to Taxation

If U.S. tax law changes,
the Company’s net income may be reduced.

In the last few years, some members
of Congress have expressed concern about U.S. corporations that move their place of
incorporation to low-tax jurisdictions. Also, some members of Congress have expressed
concern over a competitive advantage that foreign-controlled insurers and reinsurers may
have over U.S. controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by
U.S. insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions, including Bermuda.
Legislation has recently been proposed in Congress that would increase the U.S. tax burden
on so-called “inverting” companies and increase the U.S. tax burden on
related-party reinsurance transactions. The Company does not know whether this legislation
or any similar legislation will ever be enacted into law. If it were enacted, the U.S. tax
burden on the Company’s Bermuda operations, or on some business ceded from its
licensed U.S. insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers, could be increased. This
could reduce the Company’s net income.

The Company and/or Bermuda Re may
be subject to U.S. corporate income tax, which would reduce the Company’s net income.

The income of Bermuda Re is a
significant portion of the Company’s worldwide income from operations. The Company
has established guidelines for the conduct of its Bermuda operations that are designed to
ensure that Bermuda Re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S.
Based on its compliance with those guidelines, the Company believes that Bermuda Re should
not be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax, other than withholding tax on U.S.
source dividend income. However, if the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
successfully contended that Bermuda Re was engaged in a trade or business in the U.S.,
Bermuda Re would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on any income that is
subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax.
Even if the IRS successfully contended that Bermuda Re was engaged in a U.S. trade or
business, the U.S.-Bermuda tax treaty would preclude the IRS from taxing Bermuda Re’s
income except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment
maintained by that subsidiary. The Company does not believe that Bermuda Re has a
permanent establishment in the U.S.  If the IRS successfully contended that Bermuda Re did
have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the U.S., it would be subject to
U.S. tax on that income.


The Company conducts its Barbados
operations in a manner designed to minimize its U.S. tax exposure. Based on its compliance
with guidelines designed to ensure that it generates only immaterial amounts, if any, of
income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., the Company believes that
it should be required to pay only immaterial amounts, if any, of U.S. corporate income
tax, other than withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income. However, if the IRS
successfully contended that the Company had material amounts of income that is subject to
the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., it would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax
on that income, and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax. Even if the IRS successfully
contended that the Company had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing
jurisdiction of the U.S., the U.S.-Barbados tax treaty would preclude the IRS from taxing
its income, except to the extent that its income was attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by it in the U.S. The Company does not believe that it has
material amounts of income attributable to a permanent establishment in the U.S. If the
IRS successfully contended, however, that the Company did have income attributable to a
permanent establishment in the U.S., it would be subject to U.S. tax on that income.

If Bermuda Re became subject to U.S.
income tax on its income or if it became subject to U.S. income tax on more than
immaterial amounts of income, its income could also be subject to the U.S. branch profits
tax. In that event, the Company and Bermuda Re would be subject to taxation at a higher
combined effective rate than if they were organized as U.S. corporations. The combined
effect of the 35% U.S. corporate income tax rate and the 30% branch profits tax rate is a
net tax rate of 54.5%. The imposition of these taxes would reduce the Company’s net
income.

The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development and the European Union are considering measures that might
increase the Company’s taxes and reduce our net income.

A number of multinational
organizations, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the
“OECD”), the European Union, the Financial Action Task Force and the Financial
Stability Forum (the “FSF”), have all recently identified some countries as not
participating in adequate information exchange, engaging in harmful tax practices or not
maintaining adequate controls to prevent corruption, such as money laundering activities.
The OECD has threatened non-member jurisdictions that do not agree to cooperate with the
OECD with punitive sanctions by OECD member countries, though specific sanctions have yet
to be adopted by OECD member countries. It is as yet unclear as to what these sanctions
will be, who will adopt them and when or if they will be imposed. On April 18, 2002, the
OECD published a list of “uncooperative tax havens,” which are those
jurisdictions from whom the OECD has not received commitments to the OECD’s
principles of regulatory and tax transparency and effective exchange of information. The
governments of both Bermuda and Barbados have made these commitments. As a result, neither
Bermuda nor Barbados is currently listed as an uncooperative tax haven. However, it is
possible that the OECD could change its view in the future and decide to list Bermuda or
Barbados as an uncooperative tax haven, or that one of the other multinational
organizations could take a different view from the OECD and decide to recommend sanctions
against Bermuda or Barbados. Any sanctions imposed on Bermuda or Barbados could increase
the Company’s taxes and reduce its net income. In addition, the Company is not able
to predict what changes will arise from the commitments given to the OECD by the
governments of Bermuda and Barbados or whether those changes will subject it to additional
taxes.


The Company and/or Bermuda Re may
become subject to Bermuda tax, which would reduce the Company’s net income.

The Company and Bermuda Re currently are
not subject to income or capital gains taxes in Bermuda. Both companies have received an
assurance from the Bermuda Minister of Finance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax
Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda
that imposes any tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain
or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then that tax
will not apply to them or to any of the Company’s operations or its shares,
debentures or other obligations until March 28, 2016. This assurance does not prevent the
application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda and does not
prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land
Tax Act 1967 of Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to the Company
or Bermuda Re. There are currently no procedures for extending these assurances. As a
result, the Company and Bermuda Re could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28,
2016, which could reduce the Company’s net income.

The Company may become subject to
Barbados tax, which would reduce the Company’s net income.

The Company has obtained an
international business company license under the Barbados International Business Companies
Act, 1991-24. Based on this license, the Company is entitled to special tax benefits,
including a preferred rate of tax on profits and gains and an exemption from withholding
tax in respect of any dividends, interest, royalties, fees or management fees deemed to be
paid to another international business company or to a person not resident in Barbados.
the Company also has obtained from the Ministry of Economic Development a fifteen year
guarantee in accordance with Section 27 of the International Business Companies Act with
regards to its continued eligibility for this preferred status. This guarantee is
applicable until 2014 and is subject to negative resolution, which means that this
guarantee can be revoked at any time. In addition, there are currently no procedures for
extending this guarantee. As a result, the Company could be ineligible for these benefits
after that period or earlier if the guarantee is revoked, which could reduce the
Company’s net income.

The Company’s net income will
be reduced if U.S. excise and withholding taxes are increased.

Bermuda Re is subject to an excise
tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums it collects with respect to risks located in the
U.S.  In addition, Bermuda Re may be subject to withholding tax on dividend income from
U.S. sources. These taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on
Bermuda Re’s business, which could reduce the Company’s net income.

Everest Re Group, Ltd.

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Everest Re Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

A. Business and Basis of
Presentation

Everest Re Group, Ltd.
(“Group”), a Bermuda company with its principal executive office in Barbados,
was established as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Everest Reinsurance Holdings, Inc.
(“Holdings”). On February 24, 2000, a corporate restructuring was completed and
Group became the new parent holding company of Holdings. Holders of shares of common stock
of Holdings automatically became holders of the same number of common shares of Group.
Prior to the restructuring, Group had no significant assets or capitalization and had not
engaged in any business or prior activities other than in connection with the
restructuring. Group, through its subsidiaries, principally provides reinsurance and
insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and international markets. As used in this document, the
“Company” means Group and its subsidiaries, except when referring to periods
prior to February 24, 2000, when it means Holdings and its subsidiaries.

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America. The statements include the following domestic
and foreign direct and indirect subsidiaries of Group: Holdings, Everest Reinsurance
(Bermuda), Ltd. (“Bermuda Re”), Everest Re Capital Trust (“Capital
Trust”), Everest International Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Everest International”),
formerly AFC Re Ltd., Mt. McKinley Insurance Company (“Mt. McKinley”), formerly
Gibraltar Casualty Company, Everest Global Services, Inc. (“Global Services”),
Everest Advisors (Ireland) Limited, Everest Re Advisors, Ltd., Everest Reinsurance Company
(“Everest Re”), Everest National Insurance Company (“Everest
National”), Everest Indemnity Insurance Company (“Everest Indemnity”),
Everest Re Holdings, Ltd. (“Everest Ltd.”), Everest Security Insurance Company
(“Everest Security”), formerly Southeastern Security Insurance Company, Everest
Insurance Company of Canada (“Everest Canada”), Mt. McKinley Managers, L.L.C.
(“Managers”), Workcare Southeast, Inc. (“Workcare Southeast”),
Workcare Southeast of Georgia, Inc. (“Workcare Georgia”) and Workcare, Inc. All
amounts are reported in U.S. dollars.

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities (and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities) at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

B. Investments

Fixed maturity investments are all
classified as available for sale. Unrealized appreciation and depreciation, as a result of
temporary changes in market value during the period, are reflected in shareholders’
equity, net of income taxes in “accumulated other comprehensive income”. Equity
securities are carried at market value with unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as a
result of temporary changes in market value during the period, are reflected in
shareholders’ equity, net of

F-7

income taxes in “accumulated
other comprehensive income”. Unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity
securities, which are deemed other than temporary, are charged to net income as realized
capital losses. Short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates market
value. Realized gains or losses on sale of investments are determined on the basis of
identified cost. For non-publicly traded securities, market prices are determined through
the use of pricing models that evaluate securities relative to the U.S. Treasury yield
curve, taking into account the issue type, credit quality and cash flow characteristics of
each security. For publicly traded securities, market value is based on quoted market
prices. Retrospective adjustments are employed to recalculate the values of loan-backed
and asset-backed securities. Each acquisition lot is reviewed to recalculate the effective
yield. The recalculated effective yield is used to derive a book value as if the new yield
were applied at the time of acquisition. Outstanding principal factors from the time of
acquisition to the adjustment date are used to calculate the prepayment history for all
applicable securities. Conditional prepayment rates, computed with life to date factor
histories and weighted average maturities, are used to affect the calculation of projected
and prepayments for pass through security types. Other invested assets include limited
partnerships and rabbi trusts. Limited partnerships are valued pursuant to the equity
method of accounting, which management believes approximates market value. The
Supplemental Retirement Plan rabbi trust, the Deferred Compensation Plan rabbi trust and
the Supplemental Savings Plan rabbi trust are carried at market value. Cash includes cash
and bank time deposits with original maturities of ninety days or less.

C. Uncollectible
Reinsurance Balances

The Company provides reserves for
uncollectible reinsurance balances based on management’s assessment of the
collectibility of the outstanding balances. Such reserves were $33.6 million at December
31, 2003 and $31.6 million at December 31, 2002. See also Note 11.

D. Deferred Acquisition
Costs

Acquisition costs, consisting
principally of commissions and brokerage expenses and certain premium taxes and fees
associated with the Company’s reinsurance and insurance business incurred at the time
a contract or policy is issued, are deferred and amortized over the period in which the
related premiums are earned, generally one year. Deferred acquisition costs are limited to
their estimated realizable value based on the related unearned premiums, anticipated
claims and claim expenses and anticipated investment income. Deferred acquisition costs
amortized to income were $863.9 million, $551.8 million and $396.8 million in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

The present value of in force annuity
business is included in deferred acquisition costs. This value is amortized over the
expected life of the business at the time of acquisition. The amortization each year will
be a function of the gross profits each year in relation to the total gross profits
expected over the life of the business, discounted at an assumed net credit rate.

E. Reserve for Losses and
Loss Adjustment Expenses

The reserve for losses and loss
adjustment expenses (“LAE”) is based on individual case estimates and reports
received from ceding companies. A provision is included for losses and LAE incurred but
not reported (“IBNR”) based on past experience. A provision is also included for
certain potential liabilities relating to asbestos and environmental (“A&E”)
exposures, which liabilities cannot be estimated with traditional reserving techniques.
See also Note 3. The reserves are reviewed continually and any changes in estimates are
reflected in earnings in the

F-8

period the adjustment is made.
Management believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company’s losses
and LAE. Loss and LAE reserves are presented gross of reinsurance receivables and incurred
losses and LAE are presented net of ceded reinsurance.

Accruals for contingent commission
liabilities are established for reinsurance contracts that provide for the stated
commission percentage to increase or decrease based on the loss experience of the
contract. Changes in the estimated liability for such arrangements are recorded as
contingent commissions. Accruals for contingent commission liabilities are determined
through the review of the contracts that have these adjustable features and are estimated
based on expected loss and LAE.

F. Future Policy Benefit
Reserve

Liabilities for future policy
benefits on annuity policies are carried at their accumulated values. Reserves for policy
benefits include both mortality and morbidity claims in the process of settlement and IBNR
claims. Interest rate assumptions used to estimate liabilities for policy benefits range
from 3.5% to 6.9%. Actual experience in a particular period may vary.

G. Premium Revenues

Written premiums are earned ratably
over the periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned
premium reserves are established to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period.
Such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies or
computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data. Written and earned premiums,
and the related costs, which have not yet been reported to the Company are estimated and
accrued. Premiums are net of ceded reinsurance.

Annuity premiums are recognized as
revenue over the premium-paying period of the policies.

H. Income Taxes

Holdings and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Group and its other
subsidiaries, not included in Holdings’ consolidated tax return, file separate
company U.S. federal income tax returns, where required. Deferred income taxes have been
recorded to recognize the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial
reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.

I. Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities relating to
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date; revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using average
exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial
statements, net of deferred income taxes, are excluded from net income and accumulated in
shareholders’ equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
are recorded through the statement of operations.

J. Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are
calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if options granted under various stock-based compensation plans were exercised resulting
in the issuance of common shares that then shared in the earnings of the entity. See also
Note 16.

F-9

Net income per common share has been
computed below, based upon weighted average common and dilutive shares outstanding.

Options to purchase 247,956 common
shares at prices ranging from $70.18 to $73.615 per share and 212,000 common shares at
prices ranging from $63.31 to $70.18 per share were outstanding at the end of 2003 and
2002, respectively, but were not included in the computation of earnings per diluted share
for the respective years because the options’ exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the common shares at the end of such years. All options to
purchase common shares at the end of 2001 were included in the computation of earnings per
diluted share because the average market price of the common shares was greater than the
options’ exercise price at the end of 2001. All options expire on or between October
6, 2005 and September 18, 2013.

K. Unusual Loss Events in

In 2001, as a result of the terrorist
attacks at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and on various airlines on September 11,
2001 (collectively the “September 11 attacks”), the Company incurred pre-tax
losses, based on an estimate of ultimate exposure developed through a review of its
coverages, which totaled $213.2 million gross of reinsurance and $55.0 million net of
reinsurance. Associated with this reinsurance were $60.0 million of pre-tax charges,
predominantly from adjustment premiums, resulting in a total pre-tax loss from the
September 11 attacks of $115.0 million. After tax recoveries relating specifically to this
unusual loss event, the net loss from the September 11 attacks totaled $75.0 million. Over
90% of the losses ceded were to treaties, where the reinsurers’ obligations are
secured, which the Company believes eliminates material reinsurance collection risk.

As a result of the Enron bankruptcy
in 2001, the Company incurred losses, after-tax and net of reinsurance, amounting to $25.0
million. This unusual loss reflects all of the Company’s exposures to this event,
including underwriting, credit and investment.

F-10

L. Segmentation

The Company, through its subsidiaries,  operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance,  Specialty Underwriting,  International and
Bermuda.    See also Note 18.

M. Codification

The NAIC published a codification of
statutory accounting principles, which was adopted by the states of domicile of the
Company’s U.S. operating subsidiaries with an effective date of January 1, 2001. On
January 1, 2001, significant changes to the statutory basis of accounting became
effective. The cumulative effect of these changes was recorded as a direct adjustment to
statutory surplus. See also Note 14C.

N. Derivatives

The Company has in its product
portfolio two remaining credit default swaps, which it no longer offers, and five
specialized equity put options. These products meet the definition of a derivative under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS 133”). The Company’s
position in these contracts is unhedged and is accounted for as a derivative in accordance
with FAS 133. Accordingly, these contracts are carried at fair value and are recorded in
“Other liabilities” in the statement of financial position and changes in fair
value are recorded in the statement of operations.

O. Deposit Assets and
Liabilities

In the normal course of its
operations, the Company enters into contracts that do not meet the risk transfer
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113, “Accounting and
Reporting for Reinsurance of Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts”. These
contracts are accounted for using the deposit accounting method. For these contracts, the
Company originally records deposit liabilities for an amount equivalent to the assets
received. Actuarial studies are used to estimate the final liabilities under these
contracts with any change reflected in the statement of operations.

P. Stock-based Employee
Compensation

Prior to 2002, the Company accounted
for its stock-based employee compensation plans (See Note 16) under the recognition and
measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”, and related interpretations. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company
adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS
123”) prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after January
1, 2002.

Had the compensation cost for the
Company’s stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at
the grant dates for awards prior to January 1, 2002 under those plans consistent with the
method of FAS 123, the Company’s net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

The fair value of each option grant
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions: (i) dividend yields ranging from 0.5% to 0.9%, (ii) expected
volatility ranging from 32.9% to 45.8%, (iii) risk-free interest rates ranging from a low
of 4.7% to a high of 7.0% and (iv) expected life of 7.3-7.5 years.

Q. Policyholder Dividends

The Company issues certain insurance
policies with dividend payment features. These policyholders share in the operating
results of their respective policies in the form of dividends declared. Dividends to
policyholders are accrued during the period in which the related premiums are earned and
are determined based on the terms of the individual policies.

R. Application of New
Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”).
FAS 142 established new accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other
intangible assets. It requires that an entity determine if other intangible assets have an
indefinite useful life or a finite useful life. Goodwill and those intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization and must be tested at least
annually for impairment. Those with finite useful lives are subject to amortization and
must be tested at least annually for impairment. This statement is effective for all
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company adopted
FAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The implementation of this statement did not have a material
impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” (“FAS
150”). The company adopted the accounting treatment in accordance with FAS 150, and
has reclassified its trust preferred securities as a liability in its financial statements
for the period ended June 30, 2003.

In January 2003, the FASB issued
Financial Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46”). FIN 46 addresses whether certain types of entities, referred to as
variable interest entities (“VIEs”), should be consolidated in a company’s
financial statements. During October 2003, the FASB deferred the effective date of FIN 46
provisions for VIEs created prior to February 1, 2003 to the first reporting period ending
after December 15, 2003. During December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, which replaced FIN
46. FIN 46R is effective for entities that had not adopted FIN 46 as of December 24, 2003
no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2003. Upon
adoption of FIN 46R, trust preferred securities that are deemed VIEs, will be
de-consolidated with the resulting liabilities to the trust included as a component of
long-term debt with no change in the reporting of distributions.

F-12

S. Investments –
Interest Only Strips

Commencing with the second quarter of
2003, the Company has invested in interest only strips of mortgage-backed securities
(“interest only strips”). These securities give the holder the right to receive
interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest
payments on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The
ultimate cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of
the mortgage pool. Generally, as market interest rates and more specifically market
mortgage rates decline, mortgagees tend to refinance which will decrease the average life
of a mortgage pool and decrease expected cash flows. Conversely, as market interest rates
and more specifically mortgage rates rise, repayments will slow and the ultimate cash
flows will tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to
increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These
movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the
Company’s other fixed income investments. The market value of the interest only
strips was $310.2 million at December 31, 2003.

The Company accounts for its
investment in interest only strips in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No.
99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchases and Beneficial
Interests in Securitized Financial Assets” (“EITF 99-20”). EITF 99-20 sets
forth the rules for recognizing interest income on all credit-sensitive mortgage and
asset-backed securities and certain prepayment-sensitive securities including agency
interest only strips, whether purchased or retained in securitization and determining when
these securities must be written down to fair value because of impairment. EITF 99-20
requires the valuation of residual interests in securitizations to be recorded as a
reduction to the carrying value of the residual interests through a charge to earnings,
rather than an unrealized loss in shareholders’ equity, when any portion of the
decline in fair value is attributable to an impairment loss. As such, the Company recorded
a realized capital loss from impairments on its interest only strips of $46.2 million for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, which was partially offset by realized gains of
$12.7 million for the same period.

F-13

2. Investments

The amortized cost, market value, and
gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of fixed maturity investments and equity
securities are presented in the tables below:

The amortized cost and market value
of fixed maturities are shown in the following table by contractual maturity.
Mortgage-backed securities generally are more likely to be prepaid than other fixed
maturities. As the stated maturity of such securities may not be indicative of actual
maturities, the total for mortgage-backed securities is shown separately.

F-14

Proceeds from sales of fixed maturity
investments during 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $1,219.0 million, $2,029.1 million and $757.8
million, respectively. Gross gains of $49.9 million, $91.9 million and $19.3 million and
gross losses of $16.8 million, $41.3 million and $32.4 million were realized on those
fixed maturity sales during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Proceeds from sales of
equity security investments during 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $8.1 million, $19.9 million
and $33.3 million, respectively. Gross gains of $0.8 million, $0.9 million and $13.4
million and gross losses of $0.0 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million were realized on
those equity sales during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The changes in net unrealized gains
(losses) of investments of the Company are derived from the following sources:

The Company frequently reviews its
investment portfolio for declines in market value and focuses its attention on securities
whose fair value has fallen below 80% of their amortized value at the time of review. The
Company then assesses whether the decline in value is temporary or “other than
temporary”. In making its assessment, the Company evaluates the current market and
interest rate environment as well as specific issuer information. Generally, a change in
the market or interest rate environment does not constitute impairment but rather a
temporary decline in market value. Temporary declines in market value are recorded as an
unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income. If the Company determines that
the decline is “other than temporary”, the carrying value of the investment is
written down to fair value and a realized loss is recorded in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s

F-15

assessments are based on the
issuer’s current financial position and timeliness with respect to interest and/or
principal payments as well as relevant information provided by rating agencies, investment
advisors and analysts.

The table below displays the
aggregate fair value and gross unrealized depreciation, by investment category and length
of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as
of December 31, 2003:

The aggregate fair value and gross
unrealized losses related to investments in an unrealized loss position as of December 31,
2003 is $1.8 billion and $43.7 million, respectively. The $38.1 million of unrealized
losses related to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for one year or
less are primarily comprised of highly rated government, municipal and corporate bonds.
The unrealized losses are primarily related to the general movements in interest rates
throughout the year. Each security when evaluated individually has an immaterial impact on
the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flow.

The $5.5 million of unrealized losses
related to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for one year or more
relate primarily to two collateralized debt obligations where the Company has a mid-level
tranche position in each security. Given that the Company’s position in each security
is adequately collateralized, impairment is not warranted at this time.

F-16

The components of net investment
income are presented in the table below:

The components of realized capital
(losses) gains are presented in the table below:

The net realized capital losses for
2003 include $25.7 million relating to write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be
impaired on an other than temporary basis and $46.2 million related to the impairment on
interest only strips in accordance with EITF 99-20. Net realized losses for 2002 and 2001
included $101.3 million and $22.6 million, respectively, relating to write-downs in the
value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis.

Securities with a carrying value
amount of $755.1 million at December 31, 2003 were on deposit with various state or
governmental insurance departments in compliance with insurance laws.

During 2001, the Company sold five
European put options based on the Standard & Poor’s 500 (“S & P
500”) index for total consideration, net of commission, of $16.9 million. These
contracts each have a single exercise date with maturities ranging from 18 to 30 years and
strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No amounts would be payable under these
contracts if the S & P 500 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise
dates. If the S & P 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable
exercise date, the amount due would vary proportionately with the percentage the index was
below the strike price. Based on historical index values and trends, the Company estimates
the probability for each contract of the S & P index being below the strike price on
the exercise date ranges from .20% to 4.42%. The theoretical maximum payouts under the
contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S & P 500 index value were
zero. The present value of these theoretical maximum payouts using a 6% discount factor is
$152.7 million.

F-17

Because there are no published market
values available for these long term index put options, a Black-Scholes model is used to
estimate market value. The factors used in determining market value are the S & P 500
index value at the financial statement date, current interest rates matching the duration
of the puts and estimated volatility, with current market option volatility extrapolated
to the put maturities using historical data. Movements in the mark to model are reflected
through the income statement.

During 2000, the Company entered into
three credit swap derivative contracts, which provide credit default protection on a
portfolio of referenced securities. Due to changing credit market conditions and defaults,
the Company recorded net after-tax losses from these contracts of $0.0 million, $3.9
million and $13.7 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, to reflect them at fair
value, with the 2001 losses principally attributable to the Company’s exposure to the
Enron bankruptcy. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the remaining maximum after-tax net
loss exposure under these contracts is $2.9 million and $3.1 million, respectively.

The Company’s position in these
contracts is unhedged and is accounted for as derivatives in accordance with FAS 133.
Accordingly, these contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded
in the statement of operations.

3. Reserve for Losses
and LAE

Activity in the reserve for losses
and LAE is summarized as follows:

Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled
$6,361.2 million at December 31, 2003, $4,905.6 million at December 31, 2002, and $4,278.3
million at December 31, 2001. The increase in 2003 is primarily attributable to increased
premiums earned, net prior period reserve adjustments in select areas and normal
variability in claim settlement. The increase in 2002 was primarily attributable to
increased premiums earned, modest reserve strengthening in select areas and normal
variability in claim settlements. Reinsurance receivables totaled $1,284.1 million at
December 31, 2003, $1,116.4 million at December 31, 2002, and $895.1 million at December
31, 2001, with the

F-18

changes in 2003 consisting of the
increase in reinsurance receivables reflecting an additional $85.0 million cession under
the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the Company’s corporate
retrocessional program and $81.1 million losses ceded as part of a reinsurance agreement
between Mt. McKinley and Prupac. At December 31, 2003, $494.5 million, or 38.5% was
receivable from subsidiaries of London Reinsurance Group. These receivables are
effectively secured by a combination of letters of credit and funds held arrangements
under which the Company has retained the premium payments due the retrocessionaire,
recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced such liabilities as payments are due
from the retrocessionaire. In addition, $160.0 million, or 12.5% was receivable from
Prupac whose obligations are guaranteed by The Prudential, $145.0 million or 11.3% was
receivable from Continental Insurance Company, which is partially secured by funds hld arrangements and $96.7 million, or 7.5% was receivable
from Tranatlantic Reinsurance Company.  No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s
receivables.

Prior year incurred losses increased
by $256.9 million in 2003 and $140.1 million in 2002. The increase was the result of
modest reserve strengthening in select areas, most notably in directors and officers,
surety and workers’ compensation lines, and with respect to asbestos exposures.

Activity in the reserve for future
policy benefits is summarized as follows:

The Company continues to receive
claims under expired contracts, asserting alleged injuries and/or damages relating to or
resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos. The
Company’s asbestos claims typically involve potential liability for bodily injury
from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products
containing asbestos. The Company’s environmental claims typically involve potential
liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b)
bodily injury or property damages caused by the release of hazardous substances into the
land, air or water.

The Company’s reserves include
an estimate of the Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims for which ultimate
value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. There are significant
uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E
claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure
and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying
sources of asbestos or environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating
responsibility and/or liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in
underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) potential for an asbestos
or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f)
long reporting delays, both from insureds to

F-19

insurance companies and from ceding
companies to reinsurers; (g) historical data on A&E losses, which is more limited and
variable than historical information on other types of casualty claims; (h) questions
concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (i)
uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or
environmental exposure.

With respect to asbestos claims in
particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound
the difficulty in estimating the Company’s liability. These developments include: (a)
continued growth in the number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive
plaintiff bar; (b) a disproportionate percentage of claims filed by individuals with no
functional injury from asbestos, claims with little to no financial value but that have
increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the growth in the
number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims
(including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in which companies attempt to resolve their
asbestos liabilities in a manner that is prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers
from the negotiation of bankruptcy plans); (d) the growth in claim filings against
defendants formerly regarded as “peripheral”; (e) the concentration of claims in
a small number of states that favor plaintiffs; (f) the growth in the number of claims
that might impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the
product liability portion; (g) responses in which specific courts have adopted measures to
ameliorate the worst procedural abuses; (h) an increase in settlement values being paid to
asbestos claimants; and (i) the potential that the U. S. Congress or state legislatures
may adopt legislation to address the asbestos litigation issue.

Management believes that these
uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for A&E losses significantly
less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than are reserves for other types of
losses. Given these uncertainties; management believes that no meaningful range for such
ultimate losses can be established. The Company establishes reserves to the extent that,
in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for the
Company or its ceding companies. In connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley, which
has significant exposure to asbestos and environmental claims, Prupac, a subsidiary of The
Prudential, provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the
first $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley’s reserves as of
September 19, 2000 and The Prudential guaranteed Prupac’s obligations to Mt.
McKinley. Through December 31, 2003, cessions under this reinsurance agreement have
reduced the available remaining limits to $0.0 million net of coinsurance. Due to the
uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss
reserves and, depending on coverage under the Company’s various reinsurance
arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

F-20

The following table shows the
development of prior year A&E reserves on both a gross and net of retrocessional basis
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:

At December 31, 2003, the gross
reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $123.1 million representing case reserves
reported by ceding companies, $109.1 million representing additional case reserves
established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $251.3 million representing case
reserves established by the Company on direct excess insurance claims, including Mt.
McKinley and $281.8 million representing IBNR reserves.

4. Credit Line

Effective October 10, 2003, Holdings
entered into a new three year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of lenders, replacing the December 21, 1999, three year senior revolving credit
facility, which expired on December 19, 2003. Both the October 10, 2003 and December 21,
1999 senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the
“Credit

Facility”. Wachovia

Bank is the administrative agent for
the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general corporate
purposes. The Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with
interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either (1) the Base Rate (as defined
below) or (2) an adjusted London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin.
The Base Rate is the higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time
to time as its prime rate or the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of
margin and the fees payable for the Credit Facility depend upon Holdings’ senior
unsecured debt rating.

The Credit Facility requires Holdings
to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1, Holdings to maintain a
minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its statutory
surplus at $1.0 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future
aggregate capital contributions. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance
with these covenants.

During the year ended December 31,
2003, Holdings made no payments on and had no borrowings under the Credit Facility. During
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, Holdings made payments on the Credit Facility
of $80.0 million and $152.0 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001, Holdings had new Credit Facility borrowings

F-21

of $45.0 million and $22.0 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, Holdings had outstanding Credit Facility
borrowings of $70.0 million. Interest expense incurred in connection with these borrowings
was $1.4 million, $3.5 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

5. Senior Notes

On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed
public offerings of $200.0 million principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15,
2010 and $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due March 15, 2005. Interest
expense incurred in connection with these senior notes was $38.9 million for the years
ending December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001.

6. Trust Preferred
Securities

Capital Trust is a wholly-owned
finance subsidiary of Holdings. Holdings considers that the mechanisms and obligations
relating to the trust preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by Holdings of Capital Trust’s payment obligation with
respect to the trust preferred securities.

There are certain regulatory and
contractual restrictions on the ability of Holdings’ operating subsidiaries to
transfer funds to Holdings in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.  The
insurance laws of the State of Delaware, where Holdings’ direct insurance
subsidiaries are domiciled, require regulatory approval before those subsidiaries can pay
dividends or make loans or advances to Holdings that exceed certain statutory
thresholds.  In addition, the terms of Holdings’ Credit Facility require Everest
Re, Holdings’ principal insurance subsidiary, to maintain a certain statutory surplus
level.  At December 31, 2003, $1,045.8 million of the $1,579.8 million in net assets
of Holdings’ consolidated subsidiaries were subject to the foregoing regulatory
restrictions.

In November 2002, pursuant to a trust
agreement between Holdings and JPMorgan Chase Bank, the property trustee, and Chase
Manhattan Bank USA, the Delaware trustee, Capital Trust completed a public offering of
$210.0 million of 7.85% trust preferred securities, resulting in net proceeds of $203.4
million. The proceeds of the issuance were used to purchase $210 million of 7.85% junior
subordinated debt securities of Holdings that will be held in trust by the property
trustee for the benefit of the holders of the

trust preferred securities. Holdings
used the proceeds from the sale of the junior subordinated debt principally for capital
contributions to its operating subsidiaries.

Holdings may elect to redeem the
junior subordinated debt securities, in whole or in part, at any time after November 14,
2007. If such an early redemption occurs, Capital Trust’s outstanding trust preferred
securities will also be proportionately redeemed. If there is no early redemption, Capital
Trust will redeem all of the outstanding trust preferred securities when the junior
subordinated debt securities are paid at maturity on November 15, 2032.

F-22

Distributions on the trust preferred
securities are cumulative and pay quarterly in arrears. Distributions relating to the
trust preferred securities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $16.5
million and $2.1 million, respectively.

7. Letters of Credit

The Company has arrangements
available for the issuance of letters of credit, which letters are generally
collateralized by the Company’s cash and investments. Under these arrangements, at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, letters of credit for $246.2 million and $156.5 million,
respectively, were issued and outstanding, generally supporting reinsurance provided by
the Company’s non-U.S. operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s
letters of credit as of December 31, 2003. All dollar amounts are in thousands.

8. Trust Agreements

The Company has established trust
agreements for non-affiliated ceding companies, which are collateralized by the
Company’s investments. At December 31, 2003, the total amount of the trusts was
$254.0 million.

F-23

9. Operating Lease
Agreements

commitments, exclusive of cost escalation clauses, at December 31, 2003 for all of the
Company’s operating leases with remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year

expense, net of sublease rental income, was $6.8 million, $6.7 million and $5.8 million
for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

10. Income Taxes

Under current Bermuda law, no income
or capital gains taxes are imposed on Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries. The Minister of
Finance of Bermuda has also assured Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries that, pursuant to
The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966, they will be exempt until 2016 from
any such taxes imposed in the future. In Barbados, Group is registered as an external
company and licensed as an international business company. This provides Group with
certain tax benefits, including a preferred rate of corporation tax on profits and gains
in Barbados and exemption from withholding tax on dividend payments. No tax is imposed on
capital gains.

All the income of the U.S.
subsidiaries is subject to the applicable federal, foreign, state and local taxes on
corporations. The provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of income has
been determined by reference to the individual income of each entity and the respective
applicable tax laws. It reflects the permanent differences between financial and taxable
income relevant to each entity. The significant components of the provision are as
follows:

F-24

The weighted average expected tax
provision has been calculated using the pre-tax income (loss) in each jurisdiction
multiplied by that jurisdiction’s applicable statutory tax rate. Reconciliation of the difference between the provision
for income taxes and the expected tax provision at the weighted average tax rate for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 is provided below:

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax
effect of the temporary differences between the value of assets and liabilities for
financial statement purposes and such values as measured by the U.S. tax laws and
regulations. The principal items making up the net deferred income tax asset are as
follows:

Management believes that it is more
likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets
and, accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded for the periods presented. Tax benefits of $3.5 million and $0.7
million related to compensation expense deductions for stock options exercised in 2003 and
2002, respectively, are reflected in the change in shareholders’ equity in
“additional paid in capital”.

F-25

11. Reinsurance

The Company utilizes reinsurance
agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. These
agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and LAE under
certain circumstances without relieving the insurer of its obligation to the policyholder.
Losses and LAE incurred and premiums earned are after deduction for reinsurance. In the
event reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under reinsurance agreements, the
Company would not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable
balances. The Company may hold partial collateral, including letters of credit and funds
held, under these agreements. See also Note 1C.

The
Company considers purchasing corporate level retrocessional protection covering the
potential accumulation of exposures. Such consideration includes balancing the underlying
exposures against the availability of cost-effective retrocessional protection. For years
ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate
excess of loss retrocession coverage that provided up to $175.0 million of coverage for
each year. These excess of loss policies provided coverage if Everest Re’s
consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment
point for each year of coverage. The attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and
included adjustable premium provisions that effectively caused the Company to offset, on a
pre-tax income basis up to approximately 57% of such ceded losses. The maximum recovery
for each year is $175.0 million before giving effect to the adjustable premium. During
2001 and 2002, the Company ceded $164.0 million and $11.0 million of losses, respectively,
to the 2001 cover, reducing the limit available under the contract to $0.0 million. During
2002 and 2003, the Company ceded $90.0 million and $85.0 million of losses, respectively,
to the 2000 cover, reducing the limit available under the contract to $0.0 million. During
2001 and 2002, the Company ceded $164.0 million and $11.0 million of losses, respectively,
to the 2001 cover, reducing the limit available under the contract to $0.0 million. The
Company has not purchased similar coverage subsequent to December 31, 2001.

In addition, the Company has coverage
under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by Prupac, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Prudential, in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Mt.
McKinley in September 2000. This agreement covers 80% or $160 million of the first $200
million of any adverse loss reserve development on the carried reserves of Mt. McKinley at
the date of acquisition and reimburses the Company as such losses are paid by the Company.
There were $160.0 million of cessions under this reinsurance at December 31, 2003,
reducing the limit available under the contract to $0.0 million.

In connection with the Mt. McKinley
acquisition, Prupac also provided excess of loss reinsurance for 100% of the first $8.5
million of loss with respect to certain of Mt. McKinley’s retrocessions and
potentially uncollectible reinsurance coverage. There were no cessions under this
reinsurance during the periods ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, maintaining the limit
available under the contract at $2.4 million. There was $3.6 million of cessions under
this reinsurance during the period ended December 31, 2001.

F-26

Written and premiums earned are
comprised of the following:

The amounts deducted from losses and
LAE incurred for net reinsurance recoveries were $494.4 million, $287.7 million and $486.3
million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company
carried as an asset $1,284.1 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses
ceded. Of this amount, $494.5 million, or 38.5%, was receivable from subsidiaries of
London Reinsurance Group (“London Life”), $160.0 million, or 12.5%, was
receivable from Prupac, $145.0 million or 11.3%, was receivable from Continental
Insurance Company (“Continental”) and $96.7 million, or 7.5% was receivable from Transatlantic Reinsurance Company. As of December 31, 2002, the Company carried
as an asset $1,116.4 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses ceded. Of
this amount, $440.0 million, or 39.4%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Life,
$145.0 million, or 13.0%, was receivable from Continental and $78.9 million, or 7.1%, was
receivable from Prupac. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the
Company’s receivables.

The Company’s arrangements with
London Life and Continental are managed on a funds held basis, which means that the
Company has not released premium payments to the retrocessionaire but rather retains such
payments to secure obligations of the retrocessionaire, records them as a liability,
credits interest on the balances and reduces the liability account as payments become due.
As of December 31, 2003, such funds had reduced the Company’s net exposure to
London Life to $204.9 million, effectively 100% of which has been secured by letters of
credit, and its exposure to Continental to $53.3 million. As of December 31, 2002,
such funds had reduced the Company’s net exposure to London Life to $190.2 million,
effectively 100% of which has been secured by letters of credit, and its exposure to
Continental to $60.9 million. Prupac’s obligations are guaranteed by The Prudential.

The following table shows the
components of the change in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ending
December 31, 2003 and 2002.

13. Employee Benefit
Plans

A. Defined Benefit
Pension Plans

The Company maintains both qualified
and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its U.S. employees. Generally, the
Company computes the benefits based on average earnings over a period prescribed by the
plans and credited length of service. The Company’s non-qualified defined benefit
pension plan, effected in October 1995, provides compensating pension benefits for
participants whose benefits have been curtailed under the qualified plan due to Internal
Revenue Code limitations.

Although not required to make
contributions under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, the Company contributed $7.7
million and $1.2 million to the qualified and non-qualified plans, respectively, in 2003
and $3.2 million and $2.0 million to the qualified and non-qualified plans, respectively,
in 2002. The change in the accumulated pension benefit obligation reflects the net effect
of amendments made to the plans during 2002. Pension expense for the Company’s plans
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $3.7 million, $3.6 million and
$1.6 million, respectively.

F-29

The following table summarizes the
status of these plans:

Plan assets are comprised of shares
in investment trusts with approximately 71% and 29% of the underlying assets consisting of
equity securities and fixed maturities, respectively.

Net periodic pension cost included
the following components:

The weighted average discount rates
used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for
2003, 2002 and 2001 were 6.0%, 6.75% and 7.0%, respectively. The rate of compensation
increase used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation
for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 4.50%. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 9.0%.

F-30

Amounts recognized in the statement
of financial position consist of:

The Company also maintains both
qualified and non-qualified defined contribution plans (“Savings Plan” and
“Non-Qualified Savings Plan”, respectively) covering U.S. employees. Under the
plans, the Company contributes up to a maximum 3% of the participants’ compensation
based on the contribution percentage of the employee. The Non-Qualified Savings Plan
provides compensating savings plan benefits for participants whose benefits have been
curtailed under the Savings Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations. The
Company’s incurred expenses related to these plans were $0.8 million, $0.7 million
and $0.6 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In addition, the Company maintains
several defined contribution pension plans covering non-U.S. employees. Each non-U.S.
office (Canada, London, Belgium, Hong Kong, Singapore and Bermuda) maintains a separate
plan for the non-U.S. employees working in that location. The Company contributes various
amounts based on salary, age, and/or years of service. The contributions as a percentage
of salary for the branch offices range from 2% to 12%. The contributions are generally
used to purchase pension benefits from local insurance providers. The Company’s
incurred expenses related to these plans were $0.4 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001.

The following table summarizes the
Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) for years ended December 31, 2003, and 2002,
respectively.

The Company engages a third party
investment administrator to manage the qualified and non-qualified plan for its U.S.
employees. The assets in both plans consist of debt and equity mutual funds. Due to the
long term nature of the plans, the target asset allocation for each plan consists of 70%
equities and 30% bonds.

The Company expects to contribute
between $1.0 million and $2.0 million to the qualified plan in 2004.

B. Post-retirement Plan

Beginning January 1, 2002, the
Company established the Retiree Health Plan. This plan provides health care benefits for
eligible retired employees (and their eligible dependants), who have elected coverage. The
Company currently anticipates that most covered employees will become eligible for these
benefits if they retire while working for the Company. The cost of these benefits is
shared with the retiree. The Company accrues the postretirement benefit expense during the
period of the employee’s service.

A health care inflation rate for
pre-medicare claims of 12% in 2003, was assumed to change to 11% in 2004; and then
decrease one percentage point annually to 5% in 2010, and then remain at that level.

A health care inflation rate for
post-medicare claims of 8% in 2003, was assumed to change to 7% in 2004; and then decrease
one percentage point annually to 5% in 2006, and then remain at that level.

Changes in the assumed health care
cost trend can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
plans. A one percent change in the rate would have the following effects on:

14. Dividend
Restrictions and Statutory Financial Information

A. Dividend Restrictions

Under Bermuda law, Group is
prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would reduce the realizable
value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its
issued share capital and share premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts. Group’s
ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is dependent upon dividends from its
subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends by insurer subsidiaries is limited under
Bermuda law and the laws of the various U.S. states in which Group’s insurance and
reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled. The limitations are generally
based upon net income and compliance with applicable policyholders’ surplus or
minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio requirements as determined in accordance with
the relevant statutory accounting practices.

Under Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is
prohibited from declaring or making payment of a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum
solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is also
unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless, after
payment of the dividend, the value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as
certified by its approved actuary, exceeds its liabilities for long-term business by at
least the $250,000 minimum solvency margin. Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary
Authority is required if Bermuda Re’s dividend payments would reduce its prior
year-end total statutory capital by 15.0% or more.

Delaware law provides that an
insurance company which is either an insurance holding company or a member of an insurance
holding system and is domiciled in the state shall not pay dividends without giving prior
notice to the Insurance Commissioner of Delaware and may not pay dividends without the
approval of the Insurance Commissioner if the value of the proposed dividend, together
with all other dividends and distributions made in the preceding twelve months, exceeds
the greater of (1) 10% of statutory surplus or (2) net income, not including realized
capital gains, each as reported in the prior year’s statutory annual statement. In
addition, no dividend may be paid in excess of unassigned earned surplus. At December 31,
2003, Everest Re had $171.6 million available for payment of dividends in 2004 without
prior regulatory approval.

B. Statutory Financial
Information

Everest Re prepares its statutory
financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) and the Delaware
Insurance Department. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in the NAIC
Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. The capital and statutory surplus of Everest
Re was $1,715.5 million (unaudited) and $1,494.0 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The statutory net income of Everest Re was $164.6 million (unaudited), $77.6
million and $78.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Bermuda Re prepares its statutory
financial statements in conformity with the accounting principles set forth in Bermuda in
The Insurance Act 1978, amendments thereto and Related Regulations. The statutory capital
and surplus of Bermuda Re was $1,220.6 million (unaudited) and $895.4 million at December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The statutory net income of Bermuda Re was $127.1 million
(unaudited), $67.5 million and $46.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002,
and 2001 respectively.

F-34

C. Codification

The Company’s U.S. insurance
subsidiaries file statutory-basis financial statements with the state departments of
insurance in the states in which the subsidiary is licensed. On January 1, 2001,
significant changes to the statutory-basis of accounting became effective. The cumulative
effect of these changes has been recorded as a direct adjustment to statutory surplus. The
cumulative effect of these changes in 2001 increased Everest Re’s statutory surplus
by $57.1 million.

15. Contingencies

The Company does not believe that
there are any material pending legal proceedings to which it or any of its subsidiaries is
a party or of which any of their properties are subject.

In the ordinary course of business,
the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute
resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the Company’s rights and
obligations under insurance and reinsurance agreements and other more general contracts.
In some disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect
funds owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others to
collect funds or enforce alleged rights. Such disputes are resolved through formal and
informal means, including litigation and arbitration.

In all such matters, the Company
believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. The Company also
regularly evaluates those positions, and where appropriate, establishes or adjusts
insurance reserves to reflect its evaluation. The Company’s aggregate reserves take
into account the possibility that the Company may not ultimately prevail in each and every
disputed matter. The Company believes its aggregate reserves reduce the potential that an
adverse resolution of one or more of these matters, at any point in time, would have a
material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
However, there can be no assurances that adverse resolutions of such matters in any one
period or in the aggregate will not result in a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations.

The Prudential sells annuities, which
are purchased by property and casualty insurance companies to settle certain types of
claim liabilities. In 1993 and prior years, the Company, for a fee, accepted the claim
payment obligation of these property and casualty insurers, and, concurrently, became the
owner of the annuity or assignee of the annuity proceeds. In these circumstances, the
Company would be liable if The Prudential were unable to make the annuity payments. The

F-35

estimated cost to replace all such
annuities for which the Company was contingently liable at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was
$153.8 million and $150.5 million, respectively.

The Company has purchased annuities
from an unaffiliated life insurance company with an A+ (Superior) rating from A.M. Best to
settle certain claim liabilities of the Company. Should the life insurance company become
unable to make the annuity payments, the Company would be liable for those claim
liabilities. The estimated cost to replace such annuities at December 31, 2003 and 2002
was $16.0 million and $14.8 million respectively.

16. Stock Based
Compensation Plans

The Company has a 2002 Stock
Incentive Plan (“2002 Employee Plan”), a 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (“1995
Employee Plan”), a 2003 Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Plan (“2003
Director Plan”), a 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (“1995
Director Plan”) and Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999 which award options to
non-employee directors. The Company implemented FAS No. 123 in 2002, and related
interpretations in accounting for these plans and Board actions. Accordingly, option
compensation expense of $2.0 million and $0.6 million have been recognized in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, for stock options granted under the 2002 Employee Plan, the 1995 Employee
Plan, the 2003 Director Plan and the 1995 Director Plan.

A summary of the status of the
Company’s shareholder approved and non-approved plans as of December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001 and changes during the years then ended is presented in the following table:

Compensation Plans
Approved by Shareholders:

F-36

Under the 2003 Director Plan, 500,000
common shares have been authorized to be granted as stock options or stock awards to
non-employee directors of the Company. At December 31, 2003, there were 487,500 remaining
shares available to be granted. The 2002 Employee Plan replaced the 1995 Employee Plan,
therefore, no further awards will be granted under the 1995 Employee Plan. Under the 2002
Employee Plan 4,000,000 common shares have been authorized to be granted as stock options,
stock awards or restricted stock awards to officers and key employees of the Company. At
December 31, 2003, there were 3,210,250 remaining shares available to be granted under the
2002 Employee Plan. Under the 1995 Director Plan, a total of 50,000 common shares have
been authorized to be granted as stock options to non-employee directors of the Company.
At December 31, 2003, there were 37,439 remaining shares available to be granted.

Compensation Plans Not
Approved by Shareholders:

Compensation plans not approved by
shareholders refer to Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999, which awarded options to
non-employee directors. The Board actions were designed to award non-employee directors
with the options to purchase common stock to increase the ownership interest in the
Company of non-employee directors whose services are considered essential to the
Company’s continued progress, to align such interests with those of the shareholders
of the Company and to provide them with a further incentive to serve as directors to the
Company. Under Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999 a total of 40,000, 30,000 and 26,000
common shares have been granted as stock options to non-employee directors of the Company.

Options granted under the 2002
Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at 20% per year over five years, options
granted under the 1995 Director Plan vest at 50% per year over two years and options
granted under the 2003 Director Plan and the 2001, 2000 and 1999 Board actions vest at 33%
per year over three years. All options are exercisable at fair market value of the stock
at the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. Restricted shares
granted under the 2002 Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at 20% per year over
five years.

F-37

The following table summarizes
information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2003:

In addition to the 2002 Employee
Plan, the 1995 Employee Plan, the 2003 Director Plan and the 1995 Director Plan, Group
issued 1,312 common shares in 2003, 2,248 common shares in 2002 and 2,604 common shares in
2001. These issuances had aggregate values of $100,000, $145,000 and $179,500 to the
Company’s non-employee directors as compensation for their service as directors in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Since its 1995 initial public
offering, the Company has issued to certain key employees of the Company 138,100
restricted shares of stock. Upon issuance of restricted shares, unearned compensation is
charged to shareholders’ equity for the cost of the restricted stock and is amortized
over the vesting period. The amount of earned compensation recognized as expense with
respect to restricted stock awards was $382,835, $41,708 and $54,924 for 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The Company acquired 563 and 488 common shares at a cost of $42,449
and $26,882 in 2003 and 2002, respectively from employees who chose to pay required
withholding taxes with shares exercised under the stock option grants or restricted
shares, which became unrestricted. The Company acquired 604 common shares at a cost of
$49,999 in 2003 from a non-employee director who chose to pay the option exercise price
with shares. Also in 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded contributions of paid in
capital in the amount of $3.5 million, $0.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively,
representing the tax benefits attributable to the difference between the amount of
compensation expense deductible for tax purposes with respect to the stock awards and the
amount of such compensation expense reflected in the Company’s financial statements.

17. Related-Party
Transactions

During the normal course of business,
the Company, through its affiliates, engages in reinsurance and brokerage and commission
business transactions, which management believes to be at arm’s-length, with
companies controlled by or affiliated with its outside directors. Such transactions,

F-38

individually and in the aggregate,
are not material to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

18. Segment Reporting

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property
and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance
brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance
operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent
relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S.  The Specialty Underwriting
operation writes accident and health (“A&H”), marine, aviation and surety
business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies.
The International operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest
Re’s branches in London, Canada, and Singapore, in addition to foreign business
written through Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation
provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and
reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, including with
respect to capital, investments and support operations. As a result, management monitors
and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their
underwriting gain or loss (“underwriting results”). The Company utilizes
inter-affiliate reinsurance and such reinsurance does not impact segment results, as
business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first
produced. Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred,
commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses. The accounting policies
of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1L, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies.

The Company does not maintain
separate balance sheet data for its operating segments. Accordingly, the Company does not
review and evaluate the financial results of its operating segments based upon balance
sheet data.

The Company has recently announced
that one of its subsidiaries, Everest Re, has reached agreement, subject to regulatory
approval, to sell its United Kingdom branch to another of the Company’s subsidiaries,
Bermuda Re. Business for this branch is currently reported through the International
segment; however, upon completion of the transaction, the business of this branch will be
included in the Bermuda segment. Appropriate disclosures will be made in future filings to
address the segment financial fluctuations raised by the transfer.

The following tables present the
relevant underwriting results for the operating segments for the three years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.
