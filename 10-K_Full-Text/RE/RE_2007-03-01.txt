PART I

Unless otherwise indicated, all
financial data in this document have been prepared using accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). As used in this document,
“Group” means Everest Re Group, Ltd. (formerly Everest Reinsurance Group, Ltd.);
“Holdings” means Everest Reinsurance Holdings, Inc.; “Everest Re”
means Everest Reinsurance Company and its subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise
requires); and the “Company” means Everest Re Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries,
except when referring to periods prior to February 24, 2000, when it means Holdings and
its subsidiaries.

ITEM 1. Business

The Company

Group, a Bermuda company, was
established in 1999 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. On February 24, 2000, a
corporate restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding company of
Holdings, Holdings continues to be the holding company for the Company’s U.S. based
operations. Holders of shares of common stock of Holdings automatically became holders of
the same number of common shares of Group. Prior to the restructuring, Group had no
significant assets or capitalization and had not engaged in any business or prior
activities other than in connection with the restructuring.

In connection with the restructuring,
Group established a Bermuda-based reinsurance subsidiary, Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda),
Ltd. (“Bermuda Re”), which commenced business in the second half of 2000. Group
also formed Everest Global Services, Inc., a Delaware subsidiary, to perform
administrative and back-office functions for Group and its U.S. based and non-U.S. based
subsidiaries.

Holdings, a Delaware corporation, was
established in 1993 to serve as the parent holding company of Everest Re, a Delaware
property and casualty reinsurer formed in 1973. Until October 6, 1995, Holdings was an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“The
Prudential”). On October 6, 1995, The Prudential sold its entire interest in the
shares of common stock of Holdings in an initial public offering (the “IPO”).

The Company’s principal
business, conducted through its operating subsidiaries, is the underwriting of reinsurance
and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and international markets. The Company had gross
written premiums in 2006 of $4.0 billion with approximately 78% representing reinsurance
and 22% representing insurance, and shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2006 of $5.1
billion. The Company underwrites reinsurance both through brokers and directly with ceding
companies, giving it the flexibility to pursue business based on the ceding company’s
preferred reinsurance purchasing method. The Company underwrites insurance principally
through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers. Group’s active
operating subsidiaries, excluding Mt. McKinley Insurance Company (“Mt.
McKinley”), which is in run-off, are each rated A+ (“Superior”) by A.M.
Best Company (“A.M. Best”), a leading provider of insurer ratings that assigns
financial strength ratings to insurance companies based on their ability to meet their
obligations to policyholders.

Following is a summary of the
Company’s principal operating subsidiaries:

•

Bermuda Re, a Bermuda insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Group, is registered in
Bermuda as a Class 4 insurer and long-term insurer and is authorized to write property and
casualty business and life and annuity business. Bermuda Re commenced business in the
second half of 2000. On January 1, 2004 Bermuda Re purchased the UK branch of Everest Re.
Bermuda Re’s UK branch provides property and casualty reinsurance to the United
Kingdom and European markets. Bermuda Re had shareholders’ equity at December 31,
2006 of $2.1 billion.


•

Everest
International Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Everest International”), a Bermuda insurance
company and a direct subsidiary of Group, is registered in Bermuda as a Class 4 insurer
and is authorized to write property and casualty business. Through 2006, all of Everest
International’s business has been inter-affiliate quota share reinsurance assumed
from Everest Re and the UK branch of Bermuda Re. Everest International had
shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2006 of $377.6 million.

•

Everest Re, a Delaware insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Holdings, is a

Wyoming), the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and is authorized to conduct
reinsurance business in Canada and Singapore. Everest Re underwrites property and casualty
reinsurance for insurance and reinsurance companies in the U.S. and international markets.
Everest Re had statutory surplus at December 31, 2006 of $2.7 billion.

•

Everest National Insurance Company (“Everest National”), a Delaware insurance
company and a direct subsidiary of Everest Re, is licensed in 47 states and the District
of Columbia and is authorized to write property and casualty insurance on an admitted
basis in the jurisdictions in which it is licensed. The majority of Everest
National’s business is reinsured by its parent, Everest Re.

•

Everest Indemnity Insurance Company (“Everest Indemnity”), a Delaware insurance
company and a direct subsidiary of Everest Re, writes excess and surplus lines insurance
business in the U.S. on a non-admitted basis. Excess and surplus lines insurance is
specialty property and liability coverage that an insurer not licensed to write insurance
in a particular jurisdiction is permitted to provide to insureds when the specific
specialty coverage is unavailable from admitted insurers. Everest Indemnity is licensed in
Delaware and is eligible to write business on a non-admitted basis in 49 states, the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The majority of Everest Indemnity’s business is
reinsured by its parent, Everest Re.

•

Everest Security Insurance Company (“Everest Security”), formerly Southeastern
Security Insurance Company, a Georgia insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Everest
Re, was acquired in January 2000 and writes property and casualty insurance on an admitted
basis in Georgia and Alabama. The majority of Everest Security’s business is
reinsured by its parent, Everest Re.

•

Mt. McKinley, a Delaware insurance company and a direct subsidiary of Holdings, was
acquired by Holdings in September 2000 from The Prudential. Mt. McKinley was formed by
Everest Re in 1978 to write excess and surplus lines insurance business in the U.S. In
1985, Mt. McKinley ceased writing new and renewal insurance and commenced a run-off
operation to service claims arising from its previously written business. In 1991, Mt.
McKinley was distributed to its ultimate parent, The Prudential. Effective September 19,
2000, Mt. McKinley and Bermuda Re entered into a loss portfolio transfer reinsurance
agreement, whereby Mt. McKinley transferred, for arm’s-length consideration, all of
its net insurance exposures and reserves to Bermuda Re.

Reinsurance Industry
Overview

Reinsurance is an arrangement in
which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance company,
the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the
ceding company under one or more insurance contracts. Reinsurance can provide a ceding
company with several benefits, including a reduction in net liability on individual risks
or classes of risks, catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses and assistance
in maintaining acceptable financial ratios. Reinsurance also provides a ceding company
with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write
more business than would be possible without a concomitant increase in capital and
surplus. Reinsurance, however, does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to
policyholders.


There are two basic types of
reinsurance arrangements: treaty and facultative reinsurance. In treaty reinsurance, the
ceding company is obligated to cede and the reinsurer is obligated to assume a specified
portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company. Treaty reinsurers do
not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties and,
consequently, after a review of the ceding company’s underwriting practices, are
largely dependent on the original risk underwriting decisions made by the ceding company.
In facultative reinsurance, the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer assumes all or part
of the risk under a single insurance contract. Facultative reinsurance is negotiated
separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance normally
is purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered by their reinsurance
treaties either for amounts in excess of the dollar limits of their reinsurance treaties
or for unusual risks.

Both treaty and facultative
reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis. Under
pro rata reinsurance, the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as
the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion. Under excess of loss reinsurance, the
reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and
expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount, known as the ceding company’s
retention or reinsurer’s attachment point, generally subject to a negotiated
reinsurance contract limit.

In pro rata reinsurance, the
reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission. The ceding commission
generally is based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the business being
reinsured (commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative
expense). Premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss
reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives
because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk. There is usually no ceding
commission on excess of loss reinsurance.

Reinsurers may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure. Reinsurance of a
reinsurer’s business is called a retrocession. Reinsurance companies cede risks under
retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers, known as retrocessionaires, for reasons similar to those that cause insurers
to purchase reinsurance: to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks,
protect against catastrophic losses, stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional
underwriting capacity.

Reinsurance can be written through
intermediaries, generally professional reinsurance brokers, or directly with ceding
companies. From a ceding company’s perspective, both the broker and the direct
distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages. A ceding company’s decision
to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of
such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed.

Business Strategy

The Company’s business strategy
is to sustain its leadership position within its target reinsurance and insurance markets,
provide effective management throughout the property and casualty underwriting cycle and
achieve an attractive return for its shareholders. The Company’s underwriting
strategies seek to capitalize on its i) financial strength and capacity; ii) global
franchise; iii) stable and experienced management team; iv) diversified product and
distribution offering; v) underwriting expertise and disciplined approach; vi) efficient
and low-cost operating structure and vii) prudent risk management approach to catastrophe
exposures and retrocessional costs.

The Company offers treaty and
facultative reinsurance and admitted and non-admitted insurance. The Company’s
products include the full range of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance
coverages, including marine, aviation, surety, errors and omissions liability
(“E&O”), directors’ and officers’ liability (“D&O”),
medical malpractice, other specialty lines, accident and health (“A&H”) and
workers’ compensation.


The Company distributes its products through direct and broker
reinsurance channels in U.S., Bermuda and international markets.

The Company’s underwriting
strategy emphasizes underwriting profitability over premium volume. Key elements of this
strategy include careful risk selection, appropriate pricing through strict underwriting
discipline and adjustment of the Company’s business mix to respond to changing market
conditions. The Company focuses on reinsuring companies that effectively manage the
underwriting cycle through proper analysis and pricing of underlying risks and whose
underwriting guidelines and performance are compatible with its objectives.

The Company’s underwriting
strategy emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions, such as
increased demand or favorable pricing trends. The Company believes that its existing
strengths, including its broad underwriting expertise, U.S., Bermuda and international
presence, strong financial ratings and substantial capital, facilitate adjustments to its
mix of business geographically, by line of business and by type of coverage, allowing it
to capitalize on those market opportunities that provide the greatest potential for
underwriting profitability. The Company’s insurance operations complement these
strategies by providing access to business that is not available on a reinsurance basis.
The Company carefully monitors its mix of business across all operations to avoid
unacceptable geographic or other risk concentrations.

Marketing

The Company writes business on a
worldwide basis for many different customers and for many lines of business, thereby
obtaining a broad spread of risk. The Company is not substantially dependent on any single
customer, small group of customers, line of business or geographic area. For the 2006
calendar year, no single customer (ceding company or insured) generated more than 6.7% of
the Company’s gross written premiums. The Company does not believe that a reduction
of business from any one customer would have a material adverse effect on its future
financial condition or results of operations.

Approximately 66.3%, 11.0% and 22.7%
of the Company’s 2006 gross written premiums were written in the broker reinsurance,
direct reinsurance and insurance markets, respectively. The Company’s ability to
write reinsurance both through brokers and directly with ceding companies gives it the
flexibility to write business based on the ceding company’s preferred reinsurance
purchasing method.

The broker reinsurance market
consists of several substantial national and international brokers and a number of smaller
specialized brokers. Brokers do not have the authority to bind the Company with respect to
reinsurance agreements, nor does the Company commit in advance to accept any portion of a
broker’s submitted business. Reinsurance business from any ceding company, whether
new or renewal, is subject to acceptance by the Company. Brokerage fees are generally paid
by reinsurers. The Company’s ten largest brokers accounted for an aggregate of
approximately 58.7% of gross written premiums in 2006, with the two largest brokers
accounting for approximately 17.2% (Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.) and 14.2%
(Willis Group, Ltd.) of gross written premiums. The Company does not believe that a
reduction of business assumed from any one broker would have a materially adverse effect
on the Company.

The direct reinsurance market remains
an important distribution channel for reinsurance business written by the Company. Direct
placement of reinsurance enables the Company to access clients who prefer to place their
reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon the reinsurer’s in-depth
understanding of the ceding company’s needs.

The Company’s insurance business
is written principally through general agents and surplus lines brokers. In 2006, no
single general agent generated more than 5% of the Company’s gross written premiums.
In June 2004, the Company received notification of termination with respect to its
contract with American All-Risk Insurance Services, LLC, which accounted for approximately
7.8% of the Company’s 2004 gross written premiums.


Under the terms of the contract,
the agency continued to produce business exclusively for the Company through October 15,
2004. The business produced under this relationship continued in force through the policy
expiration dates or cancellation.

The Company continually evaluates
each business relationship, including the underwriting expertise and experience brought to
bear through the involved distribution channel, performs analyses to evaluate financial
security, monitors performance and adjusts underwriting decisions accordingly.

Segment Information

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property
and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance
brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance
operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agents and
surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H,
marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and
directly with ceding companies. The International operation writes property and casualty
reinsurance through Everest Re’s branches in Canada and Singapore, in addition to
foreign business written through Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices. The
Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty
markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding
companies from its Bermuda office and property and casualty reinsurance to the United
Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control with respect to
pricing, risk management, control of aggregate exposures to catastrophe events, capital,
investments and support operations. Management generally monitors and evaluates the
financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results.
Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and loss adjustment expenses
(“LAE”) incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting
expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and
other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses,
commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by earned premium. The Company
utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance, but such reinsurance generally does not impact
segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in which the
business was first produced. For selected financial information regarding these segments,
see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Underwriting Operations

The following five year table
presents the distribution of the Company’s gross written premiums segmented by its
U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda
operations. The premiums for each operation are further split between property and
casualty business and, for reinsurance business, between pro rata or excess of loss
business:


(1)  For purposes of the presentation above, pro rata includes reinsurance attaching
               to the first dollar of loss incurred by the ceding company and insurance.

(2)  Certain totals and subtotals may not reconcile due to rounding.

(3)  Includes immaterial amounts of life and annuity premium.

(4)  International and Bermuda operations for 2003 and 2002 have been restated in
               accordance with FAS 131 due to the sale of the UK branch.


U.S. Reinsurance Operation.

The Company’s U.S. Reinsurance
          operation writes property and casualty reinsurance, both treaty and facultative,
          through reinsurance brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the
          U.S. The Company targets certain brokers and, through the broker market,
          specialty companies and small to medium sized standard lines companies. The
          Company also targets companies that place their business predominantly in the
          direct market, including small to medium sized regional ceding companies, and
          seeks to develop long-term relationships with those companies. In addition, the
          U.S. Reinsurance operation writes portions of reinsurance programs for large,
          national insurance companies.

In 2006, $587.4 million of gross
written premiums were attributable to U.S. treaty property business, of which 35.4% was
written on an excess of loss basis and 64.6% was written on a pro rata basis. The
Company’s property underwriters utilize sophisticated underwriting methods to analyze
and price property business. The Company manages its exposures to catastrophe and other
large losses by limiting exposures on individual contracts and limiting aggregate
exposures to catastrophes in any particular zone and across contiguous zones.

U.S.
          treaty casualty business accounted for $533.5 million of gross written premiums
          in 2006, of which 22.1% was written on an excess of loss basis and 77.9% was
          written on a pro rata basis. The treaty casualty business consists of
          professional liability, D&O liability, workers’ compensation, excess
          and surplus lines and other liability coverages. As a result of the complex
          technical nature of most of these risks, the Company’s casualty
          underwriters tend to specialize by line of business and work closely with the
          Company’s pricing actuaries.

The Company’s facultative unit
conducts business both through brokers and directly with ceding companies, and consists of
four underwriting units representing property, casualty, specialty and national brokerage
lines of business. Business is written from a facultative headquarters office in New York
and satellite offices in Chicago and Oakland. In 2006, $70.6 million, $107.1 million,
$13.2 million and $24.9 million of gross written premiums were attributable to the
property, casualty, specialty and national brokerage business, respectively.

In 2006, 87.8%, 9.1% and 3.1% of the
U.S. Reinsurance operation’s gross written premiums were written in the broker
reinsurance, direct reinsurance and insurance markets, respectively.

U.S.
          Insurance Operation.

In 2006, the Company’s U.S. Insurance
          operation wrote $866.3 million of gross written premiums, of which 95.3% was
          casualty, predominantly workers’ compensation insurance and 4.7% was
          property. Of the total business written, Everest National wrote $587.5 million
          and Everest Re wrote $13.9 million, principally targeting commercial property
          and casualty business written through general agents with program
          administrators. Workers’ compensation business accounted for $302.6
          million, or 34.9% of the total business written, including $170.0 million, or
          56.2%, of California workers’ compensation business. Non-workers’
          compensation business represented $563.7 million, or 65.1% of the total business
          written. Everest Indemnity wrote $239.0 million, principally excess and surplus
          lines insurance business written through surplus lines brokers. Everest Security
          wrote $25.9 million, principally non-standard auto insurance written through
          retail agents. With respect to insurance written through general agents and
          surplus lines brokers, the Company supplements the initial underwriting process
          with periodic claims, underwriting and operational reviews and ongoing
          monitoring.

Specialty Underwriting
Operation.

The Company’s Specialty Underwriting operation writes
A&H, marine, aviation and surety reinsurance. The A&H unit primarily focuses on
health reinsurance of traditional indemnity plans, self-insured health plans, accident
coverages and specialty medical plans. The marine and aviation unit focuses on ceding
companies with a particular expertise in marine and aviation business. The marine and
aviation business is written primarily through brokers and contains a significant
international component written primarily in the London market. Surety business
underwritten by the Company consists mainly of reinsurance of contract surety bonds.


Gross written premiums of the A&H
unit in 2006 totaled $83.3 million, mostly written through brokers.

Gross written premiums of the marine
and aviation unit in 2006 totaled $97.4 million, substantially all of which was written on
a treaty basis and sourced through reinsurance brokers. Marine treaties represented 64.6%
of marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2006 and consisted mainly of hull and
energy coverage. Approximately 43.4% of the marine unit premiums in 2006 were written on a
pro rata basis and 56.6% as excess of loss. Aviation premiums accounted for 35.4% of
marine and aviation gross written premiums in 2006 and included reinsurance for airlines
and general aviation. Approximately 82.9% of the aviation unit’s premiums in 2006 was
written on a pro rata basis and 17.1% as excess of loss.

In 2006, gross written premiums of
the surety unit totaled $70.5 million, 99.8% of which were written on a pro rata basis.
Most of the portfolio is reinsurance of contract surety bonds written directly with ceding
companies, with the remainder being credit reinsurance, mostly in international markets.

International
Operation.

The Company’s International operation focuses on
opportunities in the international reinsurance markets. The Company targets several
international markets, including: Canada, with a branch in Toronto; Asia, with a branch in
Singapore; and Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, which business is serviced from
Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices. The Company also writes from New Jersey
“home-foreign” business, which provides reinsurance on the international
portfolios of U.S. insurers. Approximately 83.5% of the Company’s 2006 international
gross written premiums represented property business, while 16.5% represented casualty
business. As with its U.S. operations, the Company’s International operation focuses
on financially sound companies that have strong management and underwriting discipline and
expertise. Approximately 71.9% of the Company’s international business was written
through brokers, with 28.1% written directly with ceding companies.

Gross written premiums of the
Company’s Canadian branch totaled $152.1 million in 2006 and consisted of pro rata
property (29.0%), excess property (24.4%), pro rata casualty (15.4%) and excess casualty
(31.2%). Approximately 74.5% of the Canadian premiums consisted of treaty reinsurance,
while 25.5% was facultative reinsurance.

The Company’s Singapore branch
covers the Asian markets and accounted for $143.0 million of gross written premiums in
2006. This business consisted of pro rata property (53.6%), excess property (40.8%), pro
rata casualty (3.6%) and excess casualty (2.0%).

International business written out of
Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices accounted for $435.7 million of gross
written premiums in 2006 and consisted of pro rata treaty property (67.6%), pro rata
treaty casualty (5.8%), excess treaty property (15.6%), excess treaty casualty (3.5%) and
facultative property and casualty (7.5%). Of this international business, 59.8% was
sourced from Latin America, 21.7% was sourced from the Middle East, 8.5% was sourced from
Africa, 8.3% was “home-foreign” business, 1.5% was sourced from Asia and 0.2%
was sourced from Europe.

Bermuda Operation.

The Company’s Bermuda operation writes property and casualty insurance and
reinsurance through Bermuda Re and property and casualty reinsurance through its UK
branch. In 2006, the Bermuda operation had gross property and casualty written premiums of
$267.5 million accounting for virtually all of its business, of which $47.6 million or
17.8% was facultative reinsurance or individual risk insurance and $218.6 million or 81.7%
was treaty reinsurance.

In 2006, the UK branch of Bermuda Re
wrote $547.5 million of gross treaty reinsurance premium consisting of pro rata property
(44.1%), excess property (18.8%), pro rata casualty (23.6%) and excess casualty (13.5%).

The Company’s ability to write
both property and casualty risks allows it to underwrite entire contracts or major
portions thereof that might otherwise need to be syndicated among several reinsurers. The
Company’s strategy is to “lead” in as many of the reinsurance treaties it
underwrites as possible. The lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the
largest percentage shares of the treaty and is in the strongest position to negotiate
price, terms and conditions. Management believes this strategy enables it to obtain more
favorable terms and conditions on the treaties on which it participates. When the Company
does not lead the treaty, it may still suggest changes to any aspect of the treaty. The
Company may decline to participate on a treaty based upon its assessment of all relevant
factors.

The Company’s treaty
underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among the Company’s underwriters,
actuaries and claim staff. Treaties are reviewed for compliance with the Company’s
general underwriting standards and certain larger treaties are evaluated, in part, based
upon actuarial analyses by the Company. The actuarial models used in such analyses are
tailored in each case to the subject exposures and loss experience. The Company does not
separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under its treaties. The Company
does, however, evaluate the underwriting guidelines of its ceding companies to determine
their adequacy prior to entering into a treaty. The Company, when appropriate, also
conducts underwriting, operational and claim audits at the offices of ceding companies to
monitor adherence to underwriting guidelines. Underwriting audits focus on the quality of
the underwriting staff, pricing and risk selection and rate monitoring over time. Claim
audits, when appropriate, are performed in order to evaluate the client’s claims
handling abilities and practices.

The Company’s facultative
underwriters operate within guidelines specifying acceptable types of risks, limits and
maximum risk exposures. Specified classes of large premium U.S. risks are referred to
Everest Re’s New York facultative headquarters for specific review before premium
quotations are given to clients. In addition, the Company’s guidelines require
certain types of risks to be submitted for review because of their aggregate limits,
complexity or volatility, regardless of premium amount on the underlying contract.
Non-U.S. risks exhibiting similar characteristics are reviewed by senior managers within
the involved operations.

The Company’s insurance
operations principally write casualty coverages for homogeneous risks through select
program managers. These programs are evaluated based upon actuarial analysis and the
program manager’s capabilities. The Company’s rates, forms and underwriting
guidelines are tailored to specific risk types. The Company’s underwriting,
actuarial, claim and financial functions work closely with its program managers to
establish appropriate underwriting and processing guidelines as well as appropriate
performance monitoring mechanisms.

Risk Management of
Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements

Underwriting Risk and
Accumulation Controls.

Each segment and business unit manages its
underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines. These guidelines place dollar
limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors,
including ceding company profile, line of business, geographic location and risk hazards.
In each case, the guidelines permit limited exceptions, which must be authorized by the
Company’s senior management. Management regularly reviews and revises these
guidelines in response to


changes in business unit market conditions, risk versus reward
analyses and the Company’s underwriting risk management processes.

The operating results and financial
condition of the Company can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses.
The Company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by:

•

selective underwriting practices;

•

diversifying its risk portfolio
by geographic area and by types and classes of business;

•

limiting its aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone and contiguous zones;

•

purchasing  retrocessional  protection to the extent that such  coverage can be secured  cost-effectively.  See  "Retrocession
Arrangements".

Like other insurance and reinsurance
companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single
occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other
catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. A large catastrophic event can be
expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties, facultative
certificates and across lines of business.

The Company focuses on potential
portfolio losses that could result from any single event or series of events as part of
its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events.
Accordingly, the Company employs various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it
could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These
techniques range from non-modeled deterministic approaches—such as tracking aggregate
limits exposed in catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic damage factors—to
modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated Monte
Carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a
probabilistic basis.

No single universal model is
currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global
geographic regions in which the Company conducts business. In addition, the form, quality
and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not
uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the Company’s licensed models,
which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the
results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to
estimate potential losses by and across business units. The combination of techniques
potentially adds to the imprecision of the Company’s estimates. Also, while most
models have been updated in 2006 to better incorporate factors that contributed to
unprecedented industry storm losses in 2004 and 2005, such as flood, storm surge and
demand surge, catastrophe model projections are inherently imprecise. In addition,
uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already
significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long-term frequency
and severity data.

Nevertheless, when combined with
traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models
are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing
management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk
exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events.

Projected catastrophe losses are
generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss (“PML”). The Company
defines PML as its anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused
by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused
by a hurricane or earthquake. The PML will vary depending upon the severity of modeled
simulated losses and the make-up of the in force book of business. The projected severity
levels are described in terms of “return periods”, such as “100-year
events” and


“250-year events”. For example, a 100-year PML corresponds to
the estimated loss from a single event which has a 1% probability of being exceeded in a
twelve month period. Conversely, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss from a
single event will fall below the indicated PML. It is important to note that PMLs are
estimates. Modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model. As a
result, there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled
event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary
materially from the modeled event PML.

From a risk management perspective,
the Company endeavors to manage its catastrophe risk profile such that the projected economic loss
from its largest 100-year event does not exceed approximately $500 million. Economic loss
is viewed as the gross PML loss reduced by estimated reinstatement
premiums to renew coverage and income taxes. The impact of income taxes on the PML depends on the
distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate
reinsurance. Management also monitors its largest PMLs at multiple points along the loss
distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 year
return periods. This process enables management to identify exposure accumulations to
integrate into enterprise risk, underwriting and capital management processes.

The Company’s catastrophe loss
projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a
formal risk management review process. The table below reflects the Company’s pre-tax
PMLs at various return times for its top three zones/perils (as ranked by the largest 1 in
100 year events) based on loss projection data as of January 1, 2007:

The above PML table is both gross and
net of retrocessional coverage. While the Company considers purchasing corporate level
retrocessional protection by evaluating the underlying exposures in comparison to the
availability of cost-effective protection, there was no retrocessional coverage in place
at January 1, 2007. The Company continues to evaluate the availability and cost of various
retrocessional products and less mitigation approaches in the marketplace.

The projected economic losses for the
three highest 1 in 100 PML losses in the above table are as follows: for the Southeast
U.S. wind storm, $471 million; for the European windstorm, $462 million and for California
earthquake, $350 million. The projection for the Southeast windstorm does not consider any
impacts from the recently enacted Florida insurance reform that increases insurers’
access to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, thus potentially reducing the amount of
reinsurance purchased from the private reinsurance markets. The Company is unable to
predict if this will reduce future reinsurance coverage in Florida and correspondingly
reduce the PML for a Southeast windstorm.

The Company believes that its methods
of monitoring, analyzing and managing catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk
management framework, which can be integrated with its underwriting business and capital
management activities. However, there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the
models, risk management framework and underlying exposures. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the Company will not experience losses from individual events that exceed
the PML or other return period projections, perhaps by a material amount. Nor can there be
assurance that the Company will not experience events


impacting multiple zones, or
multiple severe events that could, in the aggregate, exceed the Company’s PML
expectations by a significant amount.

Terrorism Risk.

The Company does not have significant exposure to losses from terrorism
risk. While the Company writes some reinsurance contracts covering
terrorists’ events, the Company’s risk management philosophy is to limit the
amount of coverage provided and specifically not provide terrorism coverage for properties
or in areas that may be considered a target for terrorists. Although providing terrorism
coverage on reinsurance contracts is negotiable, most insurance policies mandate inclusion
of terrorism coverage. As a result, the Company is exposed to losses from terrorism on its
U.S. insurance book of business, particularly its workers’ compensation policies;
however, the Company generally does not insure the large corporations or corporate
locations that would result in a large concentration of risk.

As a result of its limited exposure,
the Company does not believe the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 that was signed
into law November 2002 and amended in December 2005 has had or will have a significant
impact on its operations.

Retrocession
Arrangements.

The Company considers retrocessional agreements to reduce its
exposure on specific business written and potential accumulations of exposures across some
or all of the Company’s operations. Where reinsurance is purchased, the agreements
provide for recovery of a portion of losses and loss adjustment expenses from
retrocessionaires. The level of retrocessional coverage varies over time, reflecting the
underwriter’s and/or Company’s view of the changing dynamics of both the
underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets. All retrocessional purchasing decisions
consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing,
terms, conditions and availability of such coverage, with the aim of securing
cost-effective protection. No assurance can be given that the Company will seek or be able
to obtain retrocessional coverage in the future similar to that in place currently or in
the past.

The Company does not typically
purchase significant retrocessional coverage for specific reinsurance business written,
but it will do so when management deems it to be prudent and/or cost-effective to reinsure
a portion of the specific risks being assumed. The Company also participates in
“common account” retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties
whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its
reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties. Common account retrocessional
arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating
companies, including the ceding company, with respect to the involved treaties.

The Company typically considers the
purchase of reinsurance to cover insurance program exposures written by the U.S. Insurance
operation. The type of reinsurance coverage considered is dependent upon individual risk
exposures, individual program exposures, aggregate exposures by line of business, overall
segment exposures and the cost effectiveness of available reinsurance. Facultative
reinsurance will typically be considered for individual accounts with large exposure and
quota share reinsurance will generally be considered for individual programs of business.
In evaluating the purchase of reinsurance for a line of business, the Company generally
seeks to limit exposure to individual claim severity as opposed to frequency.

The Company also considers purchasing
corporate level retrocessional protection covering the potential accumulation of
exposures. Such consideration includes balancing the underlying exposures against the
availability of cost-effective retrocessional protection. For years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss
retrocession coverage that provided up to $175 million of coverage for each year. These
excess of loss policies provided coverage if Everest Re’s consolidated statutory
basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a specified attachment point for each year of
coverage. The attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included adjustable
premium provisions that effectively caused the Company to offset, on a pre-tax income
basis, up to approximately 57% of such ceded losses. The maximum recovery for each year
was $175 million before giving effect to the adjustable premium. As of


December 31, 2005,
the Company had ceded the maximum limits under all three contracts. The Company has not
purchased similar corporate level coverage subsequent to December 31, 2001.

All of the Company’s
retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore, are
accounted for as reinsurance under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113,
“Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short Duration and Long Duration
Contracts”.

In connection with the Company’s
acquisition of Mt. McKinley in September 2000, the Company had coverage under an aggregate
excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by Prudential Property and Casualty
Insurance Company of Indiana (“Prupac”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Prudential. On October 31, 2003, LM Property & Casualty Insurance Company
(“LM”) completed its purchase of Prupac and its obligations from The Prudential.
The Prudential continues to guarantee LM’s obligation under this agreement. This
agreement covers 80%, or $160 million, of the first $200 million of any adverse loss
reserve development on the carried reserves of Mt. McKinley at the date of acquisition and
reimburses the Company as such losses are paid by the Company. Cessions under this
reinsurance agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at December 31,
2003.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company
carried as an asset $772.8 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses
ceded. Of this amount, $169.4 million, or 21.9%, was receivable from Transatlantic
Reinsurance Company (“Transatlantic”), $100.9 million, or 13.1%, was receivable
from LM, $100.2 million, or 13.0%, was receivable from Founders Insurance Company Limited
(“Founders”), which is partially collateralized by a trust, $100.0 million, or
12.9%, was receivable from Continental Insurance Company (“Continental”), $52.5
million, or 6.8%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Reinsurance Group
(“London Life”), which is fully collateralized by letters of credit, and $42.7
million, or 5.5%, was receivable from Munich Reinsurance Company (“Munich Re”).
No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s receivables.
Although management carefully selects its reinsurers, the Company is subject to credit
risk with respect to its reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not
relieve the Company of its liability to insureds or ceding companies. See ITEM 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Financial Condition”.

The Company’s arrangements with
London Life and Continental are managed on a funds held basis, which means that the
Company has retained the premiums earned by the retrocessionaire to secure obligations of
the retrocessionaire, recorded them as a liability, credited interest on the balances at a
stated contractual rate and reduced the liability account as payments become due. As of
December 31, 2006, such funds had reduced the Company’s net exposure to Continental
to $33.2 million. As of December 31, 2005, such funds had reduced the Company’s net
exposure to London Life to $115.4 million, effectively 100% of which has been secured by
letters of credit, and its exposure to Continental to $38.7 million.

Claims

Reinsurance claims are managed by the
Company’s professional claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial
loss reports and coverage issues, monitoring claims handling activities of ceding
companies, establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of
claims. In addition to claims assessment, processing and payment, the claims staff
selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim
procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies. Insurance claims, except those
relating to Mt. McKinley’s business, are generally handled by third party claims
service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the
Company’s professional claims staff.

The Company intensively manages its
asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) exposures through dedicated, centrally
managed claim staffs for Mt. McKinley and Everest Re. Both are staffed with experienced
claim and legal professionals who specialize in the handling of such exposures. These
units actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account, responding to claim
developments with evaluations of the involved


exposures and adjustment of reserves as
appropriate. Specific or general claim developments that may have material implications
for the Company are regularly communicated to senior management, actuarial, legal and
financial areas. Senior management and claim management personnel meet at least quarterly
to review the Company’s overall reserve positions and make changes, if appropriate.
The Company continually reviews its internal processing, communications and analytics,
seeking to enhance the management of its A&E exposures, in particular in regard to
changes in asbestos claims and litigation.

Reserves for Unpaid
Property and Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Significant periods of time may
elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the insurer
and the reinsurer and the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to
the insurer by the reinsurer. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and LAE, insurers
and reinsurers establish reserves, which are balance sheet liabilities representing
estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related
expenses for losses that have already occurred. Actual losses and LAE paid may deviate,
perhaps substantially, from such reserves. To the extent reserves prove to be insufficient
to cover actual losses and LAE after taking into account available reinsurance coverage,
the Company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to
earnings, which could be material in the period such recognition takes place. See ITEM 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Loss and LAE Reserves”.

As part of the reserving process,
insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the
impact of various factors such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect
future claim amounts, changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss
exposures and inflationary and general economic trends. While the reserving process is
difficult and subjective for insurance companies, the inherent uncertainties of estimating
such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer, due primarily to the longer time between
the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer, the
diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or
facultative contracts, the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information
regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies. In
addition, trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not
necessarily occur or affect liability development to the same degree in the future. As a
result, actual losses and LAE may deviate, perhaps substantially, from estimates of
reserves reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Like many other property and casualty
insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company has experienced adverse loss development
for prior accident years, which has led to adjustments in losses and LAE reserves. The
increase in net reserves for prior accident years reduced net income in the periods in
which the adjustments were made. There can be no assurance that adverse development from
prior years will not continue in the future or that such adverse development will not have
a material adverse effect on net income.

Changes in Historical
Reserves

The following table shows changes in
historical loss reserves for the Company for 1996 and subsequent years. The table is
presented on a GAAP basis except that the Company’s loss reserves for its Canadian
branch operations are presented in Canadian dollars, the impact of which is not material.
The top line of the table shows the estimated initial reserves for unpaid losses and LAE
recorded at each year end date. The upper (paid) portion of the table presents the
cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year on those claims for which reserves
were carried as of each specific year end. The lower (liability re-estimated) portion
shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as
of the end of each succeeding year. The reserve estimates are revised as more information
becomes known about the actual claims for which the initial reserves were carried. The
cumulative redundancy/(deficiency) line represents the cumulative change in estimates
since the initial reserve was established. It is equal to the initial reserve less the
latest estimate of the ultimate liability.


Since the Company has international
operations, some of its loss reserves are established in foreign currencies and converted
to U.S. dollars for financial reporting. Changes in conversion rates from period-to-period
impact the U.S. dollar value of carried reserves and correspondingly, the cumulative
redundancy/(deficiency) line of the table. However, unlike other reserve development that
affects net income, the impact of currency translation is a component of other
comprehensive income. To differentiate these two reserve development components, the
translation impacts for each calendar year are reflected in the table of Effects on
Pre-tax Income Resulting from Reserve Re-estimates.

Each amount other than the original
reserves in the top half of the table below includes the effects of all changes in amounts
for prior periods. For example, if a loss settled in 1999 for $100,000, was first reserved
in 1996 at $60,000 and remained unchanged until settlement, the $40,000 deficiency (actual
loss minus original estimate) would be included in the cumulative redundancy/(deficiency)
in each of the years in the period 1996 through 1998 shown below. Conditions and trends
that have affected development of the ultimate liability in the past are not indicative of
future developments. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies
or deficiencies based on this table.


(1) Includes $480.9 million relating to Mt. McKinley at December 31, 2000,
               principally reflecting $491.1 million of Mt. McKinley reserves at the
               acquisition date.

(2) The cumulative redundancy/(deficiency) includes the impact of foreign currency
               translation adjustments, except for the Canadian branch reserves, which are
               reflected in Canadian dollars.

(3) Some totals may not reconcile due to rounding.

Six of the most recent seven years in
the above table reflect cumulative deficiencies, also referred to as adverse development,
with the largest indicated cumulative deficiency in 2001. Three active classes of business
were the principal contributors to those deficiencies in the years 1999 through 2003:
professional liability reinsurance, general casualty reinsurance and workers’
compensation insurance. In 2005, the cumulative deficiency was


principally due to adverse
development of property catastrophes. In addition to these active business classes, there
has continued to be adverse experience on A&E reserves.

In the professional liability
reinsurance class, the late 1990s and early 2000s saw a proliferation of claims relating
to bankruptcies and other corporate, financial and/or management improprieties. This
resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of claims under the professional
liability policies reinsured by the Company. In the general casualty area, the Company has
experienced claim frequency and severity greater than expected in the Company’s
pricing and reserving assumptions, particularly for accident years 1999 and 2000. This
experience reflects unfavorable trends in litigation and economic variability. With
respect to both of these classes, another factor was the increasingly competitive
conditions in insurance and reinsurance markets during this period. While the Company
seeks to manage the impact of competitive condition changes on its results, it is
generally unable to insulate itself entirely from the underlying industry cycles of its
principal businesses. See ITEM 1, “Business – Competition”.

In the workers’ compensation
insurance class, the majority of which was written in California, the Company has
experienced adverse development primarily for accident years 2001 and 2002 due to higher
than expected claim frequency and severity. As a result of significant growth in this book
of business in a challenging business environment, the Company’s writings in this
class were subject to more relative variability than are some of its established and/or
stable lines of business. Although cumulative results through 2006 continue to be quite
profitable for this book of business, there has been some deterioration in claim frequency
and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002.

Management believes that adequate
provision has been made for the Company’s loss and LAE reserves. While there can be
no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future, management
believes that the Company’s existing reserves, reserving methodologies and
retrocessional arrangements reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows. These statements regarding the Company’s loss reserves are forward
looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws and are intended
to be covered by the safe harbor provisions contained therein. See ITEM 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Safe Harbor Disclosure”.


The following table is derived from
the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table above and summarizes the effect of reserve
re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations by accident year for the
same ten year period ended December 31, 2006. Each column represents the amount of net
reserve re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to
which the re-estimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on
the far right represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates for the indicated accident
years.

Since the Company has operations in
many countries, part of the Company’s loss and LAE reserves are in foreign currencies
and translated to U.S. dollars for each reporting period. Fluctuations in the exchange
rates for the currencies, period over period, affect the U.S. dollar amount of outstanding
reserves. The translation adjustment line at the bottom of the table eliminates the impact
of the exchange fluctuations from the reserve re-estimates.

The reserve development by accident
year reflected in the above table was generally the result of the same factors described
above that caused the deficiencies shown in the Ten Year GAAP Loss Development Table. The
unfavorable development experienced in the 1998 through 2001 accident years relates
principally to casualty reinsurance, including professional liability classes and
workers’ compensation insurance where, in retrospect, the Company’s initial
estimates of losses were underestimated principally as the result of unanticipated
variability in the underlying exposures. The favorable development for accident years 2002
through 2004 relates primarily to favorable experience with respect to property
reinsurance business. The unfavorable development experienced in the 2005 accident year
relates primarily to property catastrophes from the unprecedented hurricanes of 2005.


The Company’s loss reserving
methodologies continuously monitor the emergence of loss and loss development trends,
seeking, on a timely basis, to both adjust reserves for the impact of trend shifts and to
factor the impact of such shifts into its underwriting and pricing on a prospective basis.

The following table presents a
reconciliation of beginning and ending reserve balances for the years indicated on a GAAP
basis:

Development of prior year incurred
losses was $135.6 million unfavorable in 2006, $26.4 million favorable in 2005 and $249.4
million unfavorable in 2004. Such losses were the result of the reserve development noted
above, as well as inherent uncertainty in establishing loss and LAE reserves.

Reserves for Asbestos and
Environmental Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

As of year end 2006, 7.4% of reserves
reflect an estimate for the Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims for which
ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. The
Company’s A&E liabilities stem from Mt. McKinley’s direct insurance business
and Everest Re’s assumed reinsurance business. There are significant uncertainties in
estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E claims. See ITEM
7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Asbestos and Environmental Exposures” and Note 3 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mt. 
          McKinley’s book of direct A&E exposed insurance is relatively small and
          homogenous. It also arises from a limited period, effective 1978 to 1984. The
          book is based principally on excess liability policies, thereby limiting
          exposure analysis to a limited number of policies and forms. As a result of this
          focused structure, the Company believes that it is able to comprehensively
          analyze its exposures, allowing it to identify, analyze and actively monitor
          those claims which have unusual exposure, including policies in which it may be
          exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non-products asbestos
          claims.

The Company endeavors to be actively
engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to Mt.
McKinley. Such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement, negotiation,
litigation, or the monitoring of claim activity under Settlement in Place
(“SIP”) agreements. SIP agreements generally condition an insurer’s payment
upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other
measures to control the insurer’s payments. The Company’s Mt. McKinley operation
is currently managing eight SIP agreements, three of which were executed prior to the
acquisition of Mt. McKinley in 2000. The Company’s preference with respect to
coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments,
because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty.


The Company has significantly
enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time, as well as
its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active. Those
insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous, but
still active management, with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics, which may
indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity. The Company continually focuses on
further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential
exposure of policyholders, including those that may not have reported significant A&E
losses.

Everest Re’s book of assumed
reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of A&E exposed
relationships. It also arises from a limited period, effectively 1977 to 1984. Because the
book of business is relatively concentrated and the Company has been managing the A&E
exposures for many years, its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have
generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to
generate future liabilities. The Company’s claim staff has developed familiarity both
with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling
and reserving practices of those companies. This level of familiarity enhances the quality
of the Company’s analysis of its exposure through those companies. As a result, the
Company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure, such
as non-products asbestos claims, for concentrated attention. However, in setting reserves
for its reinsurance liabilities, the Company relies on claims data supplied, both formally
and informally by its ceding companies and brokers. This furnished information is not
always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of the Company’s
ultimate loss projections.

The following table summarizes the
composition of the Company’s total reserves for A&E losses, gross and net of
reinsurance, for the years ended December 31:

(1) Additional reserves are case specific reserves determined by the Company to be
               needed over and above those reported by the ceding company.

Additional losses, including those
relating to latent injuries and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type
or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the Company or the industry, may emerge
in the future. Such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the
Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Future Policy Benefit
Reserves

Future policy benefit liabilities for
annuities are reported at the accumulated fund balance of these contracts. Reserves for
those liabilities include both mortality and morbidity provisions with respect to life and
annuity claims, both reported and unreported. Actual experience in a particular period may
be worse than assumed experience and, consequently, may adversely affect the
Company’s operating results for that period. See Note 1F of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


Activity in the reserve for future
policy benefits is summarized as follows:

Investments

The board of directors of each of the
Company’s operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy
and guidelines and, together with senior management, for overseeing their execution.

The Company’s principal
investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and
reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a
high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, the Company
views its investment portfolio as having two components; 1) the investments needed to
satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by the Company’s
shareholders’ equity.

For outstanding liabilities, the
Company invests in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average
credit quality of Aa, as rated by the independent investment rating service of
Moody’s. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is
adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company’s current and projected operating
results, market conditions and the Company’s tax position. This fixed maturity
portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using
portfolio guidelines approved by the Company.

Over the past few years, the Company
has reallocated its shareholders’ equity investment portfolio to include 1) publicly
traded equity securities, primarily exchange traded funds, and 2) private equity limited
partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the
risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of
the portfolio to higher return asset classes. The Company has limited its allocation to
these asset classes because 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the
impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. At
December 31, 2006, the market value of investments in equity and limited partnership
securities approximated 40% of shareholders’ equity.

The Company’s fixed income
investment guidelines include a general duration guideline of five to six years. The
duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the
payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments. This investment duration
guideline is established and periodically revised by management, which considers economic
and business factors, as well as the Company’s average duration of potential
liabilities, which, at December 31, 2006, is estimated at approximately 3.8 years based on
the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations.

The duration of the fixed income
portfolio at December 31, 2006 was 4.1 years, down from 4.3 years at the prior year end.
This shortened duration mainly reflects the Company’s elevated short-term investment
holdings in response to relatively low interest rates combined with a flat to negative
yield curve. In addition, at various times during the past three years the Company
shortened duration in response to market interest rate movements by purchasing interest
only strips of mortgage-backed securities (“interest only strips”). The interest
only strips give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate
on an underlying pool of mortgages.


The interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are
guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash flow from these investments
is primarily dependent upon the average life of the underlying mortgage pool. Generally,
as mortgage rates decline, mortgagors are more likely to prepay their mortgage loans,
which decreases the average life of a mortgage pool and decreases expected cash flows.
Conversely, as mortgage rates rise, repayments are more likely to slow and ultimate cash
flows will tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to
increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These
movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the
Company’s other fixed income investments. The Company held no interest only strip
investments at December 31, 2006.

For each currency in which the
Company has established substantial reserves, the Company seeks to maintain invested
assets denominated in such currency in an amount approximately comparable to the estimated
liabilities. Approximately 10.5% of the Company’s consolidated reserves for losses
and LAE and unearned premiums represent estimated amounts payable in foreign currencies.

The Company’s overall financial
strength and results of operations are, in part, dependent on the quality and performance
of its investment portfolio. Net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses)
on the Company’s invested assets constituted 14.7%, 13.4%, and 11.7% of the
Company’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The Company’s cash and invested assets totaled $14.0 billion at
December 31, 2006, which consisted of 85.1% fixed maturities and cash of which 97.6% were
investment grade, 11.6% equity securities and 3.3% other invested assets. The average
maturity of fixed maturities was 7.4 years at December 31, 2006, and their overall
duration was 4.1 years. As of December 31, 2006, the Company did not have any investments
in commercial real estate or direct commercial mortgages or any material holdings of
derivative investments, other than equity index puts discussed in Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash
flow difficulty to an extent that the Company’s management believes could threaten
the issuer’s ability to meet debt service payments, except where other than temporary
impairments have been recognized.

As of December 31, 2006, the
Company’s common stock portfolio, which is comprised primarily of publicly traded
equity index funds, had a market value of $1,613.7 million, comprising 11.6% of total
investments and cash.

Financial Strength Ratings

The following table shows the current
financial strength ratings of the Company’s operating subsidiaries as reported by
A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“Standard &
Poor’s”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”).
These ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders and should not be
considered an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in a direct or indirect
equity investment in an insurance or reinsurance company.

All of the below-mentioned ratings
are continually monitored and revised, if necessary, by each of the rating agencies.

The Company believes that its
ratings, in general, have become increasingly important to its operations because they
provide the Company’s customers and investors with an independent assessment of the
Company’s underlying financial strength using a scale that provides for relative
comparisons. Strong financial ratings are particularly important for reinsurance
companies. Ceding companies must rely on their reinsurers to pay covered losses well into
the future. As a result, a highly rated reinsurer is generally preferred.

          Best states that the “A+” (“Superior”) rating is assigned to
          those companies which, in its opinion, have a superior ability to meet their
          ongoing obligations to policyholders based on A.M. Best’s comprehensive
          quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company’s balance sheet
          strength, operating performance and business profile. Standard & Poor’s
          states that the “AA-” rating is assigned to those insurance companies
          which, in its opinion, have very strong financial security characteristics with
          respect to their ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in
          accordance with their terms. Moody’s states that insurance companies rated
          “Aa” offer excellent financial security. Together with the Aaa rated
          companies, Aa rated companies constitute what are generally known as high-grade
          companies, with Aa rated companies generally having somewhat larger long-term
          risks.


Subsidiaries other than Everest Re
and Bermuda Re may not be rated by some or any rating agencies because such ratings are
not considered essential by the individual subsidiary’s customers or because of the
limited nature of the subsidiary’s operations. In particular, Mt. McKinley is not
rated because it is in run-off status.

Debt Ratings

The following table shows the debt
ratings by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s of the Holdings’
senior notes due March 15, 2010 and October 15, 2014 and Everest Re Capital Trust
(“Capital Trust”) and Everest Re Capital Trust II’s (“Capital Trust
II”) trust preferred securities due November 15, 2032 and March 29, 2034,
respectively, all of which are considered investment grade. Debt ratings are a current
assessment of the credit worthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific obligation.

A debt rating of “a” or
“a-” is assigned by A.M. Best where the issuer, in A.M. Best’s opinion, has
a strong ability to meet the terms of the obligation. A debt rating of “A-” is
assigned by Standard & Poor’s where the obligor has a strong capacity to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation, although it is somewhat more susceptible to the
adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in
higher rated categories. Standard & Poor’s assigns a debt rating of
“BBB” to issues that exhibit adequate protection parameters although adverse
economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened
capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. According to
Moody’s, a debt rating of “A3” is assigned to issues that are considered
upper-medium-grade obligations and subject to low credit risk. Obligations rated
“Baa1” are subject to moderate credit risk and are considered medium-grade and
as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.

Competition

The worldwide reinsurance and
insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market.
Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the Company
underwrites is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength
of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or
Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), underwriting expertise, the
jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity
and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and
insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and
experience in lines written. These factors operate at the individual market participant
level to varying degrees, as applicable to the specific participant’s circumstances.
They also operate in aggregate across the reinsurance industry more generally,
contributing, in combination with economic conditions and variations in the reinsurance
buying practices of insurance companies (by participant and in the aggregate), to cyclical
movements in reinsurance rates, terms and conditions and ultimately reinsurance industry
aggregate financial results.

The Company competes in the U.S.,
Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global
competitors. The Company’s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance
companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies,
reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international
underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s. Some of these
competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and have established
long-term and continuing business relationships, which can be a significant competitive
advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business
and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital
markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and
competition.


In 2006, the Company observed strong
price increases, and more restricted limits, in those property lines and regions that were
most affected by the catastrophe events of 2005, principally Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma. Reinsurance capacity in these areas was constrained, particularly for catastrophe
reinsurance, which includes southeastern U.S. exposures and in the retrocession and energy
lines. The record catastrophe losses of 2005 have also generally led to modest
strengthening for U.S. property lines that have little or no substantive catastrophe
exposure and price stabilization in most casualty insurance and reinsurance markets.
However, certain of the Company’s U.S. casualty lines continue to exhibit weaker
market conditions led by the medical stop loss and D&O reinsurance classes, as well as
the California workers’ compensation insurance line. The Company believes that U.S.
casualty reinsurance generally remains adequately priced; however, increased price
competition at the insurance company level and cedants’ increased appetite for
retaining more profitable business net following several years of hard-market conditions,
may result in modestly softer reinsurance pricing. The Company’s U.S. insurance
operation is less affected by these standard casualty insurance market conditions given
its specialty insurance program orientation. Finally, the Company continues to observe
generally stable property reinsurance market conditions in most countries outside of the
U.S., except for hardening property market conditions in Mexico following Hurricane Wilma,
while casualty rates are softening.

U.S.
          property reinsurance market conditions tightened, particularly within peak
          catastrophe zones, during 2006. This market hardening was particularly
          pronounced in third quarter renewals with incrementally higher rate changes and
          even more restrictive coverage terms than earlier in 2006. As a result, many
          reinsurance buyers were not able to fully place their reinsurance program and
          have been forced to raise retention levels and/or reduce catastrophe limit
          purchases. In turn, insurance companies continue to adjust limits and coverages
          and increase the premium rates they charge their customers. Together, these
          trends have generally resulted in insurance companies retaining more property
          risk exposure and being more prone to potential future earnings volatility than
          in past years. This trend reflects an imbalance between reinsurance supply and
          demand. As a result of this imbalance and higher rates, additional competition
          is entering the market in the form of new companies and alternative risk
          transfer mechanisms. In January 2007, the Florida legislature enacted insurance
          reform that increases insurer’s access to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe
          Fund, thus potentially reducing the amount of reinsurance purchased from the
          private reinsurance market. The Company is unable to predict the impact on
          future market conditions from the increased competition and legislative reform.
          In addition to these market forces, reinsurers continue to reassess their risk
          appetites and rebalance their property portfolios to reflect improved price to
          exposure metrics against the backdrop of: (i) recent revisions to the
          industry’s catastrophe loss projection models, which are indicating
          significantly higher loss potentials and consequently higher pricing
          requirements and (ii) elevated rating agency scrutiny and capital requirements
          for many catastrophe exposed companies.

In light of its 2005 catastrophe
experience, the Company reexamined its risk management practices, concluded that its
control framework operated generally as intended and made appropriate portfolio
adjustments to its property reinsurance operations during the first nine months of 2006.
This portfolio repositioning, particularly within peak catastrophe zones, including
Southeast U.S., Mexico and Gulf of Mexico, has enabled the Company to benefit from these
dislocated markets by carefully shifting the mix of its writings toward the most
profitable classes, lines, customers and territories and enhancing portfolio balance and
diversification.

Overall, the Company believes that
current marketplace conditions offer solid opportunities for the Company given its strong
ratings, distribution system, reputation and expertise. The Company continues to employ
its opportunistic strategy of targeting those segments offering the greatest profit
potential, while maintaining balance and diversification in its overall portfolio.

Employees

As of February 1, 2007, the Company
employed 736 persons. Management believes that employee relations are good. None of the
Company’s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and the Company
is not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.


Regulatory Matters

The Company and its insurance
subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of the various
jurisdictions in which they conduct business, including essentially all states of the
U.S., Canada, Singapore, the United Kingdom and Bermuda. These regulations vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect ceding insurance
companies and policyholders by regulating the Company’s conduct of business,
financial integrity and ability to meet its obligations. Many of these regulations require
reporting of information designed to allow insurance regulators to closely monitor the
Company’s performance.

Insurance Holding Company
Regulation.

Under applicable U.S. laws and regulations, no person,
corporation or other entity may acquire a controlling interest in the Company, unless such
person, corporation or entity has obtained the prior approval for such acquisition from
the Insurance Commissioners of Delaware and the other states in which the Company’s
insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled, currently California and
Georgia. Under these laws, “control” is presumed when any person acquires,
directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company. To
obtain the approval of any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file an
application with the relevant insurance commissioner disclosing, among other things, the
background of the acquirer and that of its directors and officers, the acquirer’s
financial condition and its proposed changes in the management and operations of the
insurance company. U.S. state regulators also require prior notice or regulatory approval
of material inter-affiliate transactions within the holding company structure.

The Insurance Companies Act of Canada
requires prior approval by the Minister of Finance of anyone acquiring a significant
interest in an insurance company authorized to do business in Canada. In addition, the
Company is subject to regulation by the insurance regulators of other states and foreign
jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business. Certain of these states and
foreign jurisdictions impose regulations regulating the ability of any person to acquire
control of an insurance company authorized to do business in that jurisdiction without
appropriate regulatory approval similar to those described above.

Dividends.

Under Bermuda law, Group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend
          if such payment would reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount
          less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its issued share capital
          and share premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts. Group’s ability to
          pay dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends
          from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries is
          limited under Bermuda law as well as the laws of the various U.S. states in
          which Group’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or
          deemed domiciled. The limitations are generally based upon net income and
          compliance with applicable policyholders’ surplus or minimum solvency and
          liquidity requirements as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory
          accounting practices. As Holdings has outstanding debt obligations, it is
          dependent upon dividends and other permissible payments from its operating
          subsidiaries to enable it to meet its debt and operating expense obligations and
          to pay dividends to Group.

Under Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is
unable to declare or make payment of a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum solvency
margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is also unable to
declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless, after payment of the
dividend, the value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as certified by its
approved actuary, exceeds its liabilities for long-term business by at least the $250,000
minimum solvency margin. Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority is required if
Bermuda Re’s dividend payments would reduce its prior year end total statutory
capital by 15.0% or more. At December 31, 2006, Bermuda Re and Everest International
exceeded their solvency and liquidity requirements by a significant margin.

The payment of dividends to Holdings
by Everest Re is subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law. Generally, Everest Re may
only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus, which was $2,704.1 million at
December 31, 2006, and only after it has given 10 days prior notice to the Delaware
Insurance Commissioner.


During this 10-day period, the Commissioner may, by order, limit
or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the Commissioner finds the insurer to be
presently or potentially in financial distress. Further, the maximum amount of dividends
that may be paid without the prior approval of the Delaware Insurance Commissioner in any
twelve month period is the greater of (1) 10% of an insurer’s statutory surplus as of
the end of the prior calendar year or (2) the insurer’s statutory net income, not
including realized capital gains, for the prior calendar year. Accordingly, the maximum
amount that will be available for the payment of dividends by Everest Re in 2007 without
triggering the requirement for prior approval of regulatory authorities in connection with
a dividend is $270.4 million.

Insurance
Regulation.

Neither Bermuda Re nor Everest International is admitted
to do business in any jurisdiction in the U.S. Both conduct their insurance business from
their offices in Bermuda, and in the case of Bermuda Re, its branch in the UK. In Bermuda,
Bermuda Re and Everest International are regulated by the Insurance Act 1978 (as amended)
and related regulations (the “Act”). The Act establishes solvency and liquidity
standards and auditing and reporting requirements and subjects Bermuda Re and Everest
International to the supervision, investigation and intervention powers of the Bermuda
Monetary Authority. Under the Act, Bermuda Re and Everest International, as Class 4
insurers, are each required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda, to maintain a
minimum of $100 million in statutory capital and surplus, to have an independent auditor
approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority conduct an annual audit and report on their
respective statutory financial statements and filings and to have an appointed loss
reserve specialist (also approved by the Bermuda Monetary Authority) review and report on
their respective loss reserves annually.

Bermuda Re is also registered under
the Act as a long-term insurer and is thereby authorized to write life and annuity
business. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is required to maintain $250,000 in statutory
capital separate from its Class 4 minimum statutory capital and surplus, to maintain a
long-term business fund, to separately account for this business and to have an approved
actuary prepare a certificate concerning its long-term business assets and liabilities to
be filed annually.

U.S.
          domestic property and casualty insurers, including reinsurers, are subject to
          regulation by their state of domicile and by those states in which they are
          licensed. The regulation of reinsurers is typically focused on financial
          condition, investments, management and operation. The rates and policy terms of
          reinsurance agreements are generally not subject to direct regulation by any
          governmental authority.

The operations of Everest Re’s
foreign branch offices in Canada and Singapore are subject to regulation by the insurance
regulatory officials of those jurisdictions. Management believes that the Company is in
compliance with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to its business and operations.
Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re.
Business for this branch was previously included in the International segment and is now
included in the Bermuda segment. As a result of this transaction, Bermuda Re’s
operations in the United Kingdom and worldwide are subject to regulation by the Financial
Services Authority (the “FSA”). The FSA imposes solvency, capital adequacy,
audit, financial reporting and other regulatory requirements on insurers transacting
business in the United Kingdom. Bermuda Re presently meets or exceeds all of the
FSA’s solvency and capital requirements.

Everest Indemnity, Everest National,
Everest Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to regulations similar to the U.S.
regulations applicable to Everest Re. In addition, Everest National and Everest Security
must comply with substantial regulatory requirements in each state where they conduct
business. These additional requirements include, but are not limited to, rate and policy
form requirements, requirements with regard to licensing, agent appointments,
participation in residual markets and claim handling procedures. These regulations are
primarily designed for the protection of policyholders.

Licenses.

Everest Re is a licensed property and casualty insurer and/or reinsurer in
          all states (except Nevada and Wyoming), the District of Columbia and Puerto
          Rico. In New Hampshire and Puerto Rico, Everest Re is


licensed for reinsurance
          only. Such licensing enables U.S. domestic ceding company clients to take credit
          for uncollateralized reinsurance receivables from Everest Re in their statutory
          financial statements.

Everest Re is licensed as a property
and casualty reinsurer in Canada. It is also authorized to conduct reinsurance business in
Singapore. Everest Re can also write reinsurance in other foreign countries. Because some
jurisdictions require a reinsurer to register in order to be an acceptable market for
local insurers, Everest Re is registered as a foreign insurer and/or reinsurer in the
following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and the Philippines. Everest National is licensed in 47
states and the District of Columbia. Everest Indemnity is licensed in Delaware and is
eligible to write insurance on a surplus lines basis in 49 states, the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico. Everest Security is licensed in Georgia and Alabama. Mt.
McKinley is licensed in Delaware and California. Bermuda Re and Everest International are
registered as Class 4 insurers in Bermuda. Bermuda Re is also registered as a long-term
insurer in Bermuda and an authorized reinsurer in the U.K.

Periodic
Examinations.

Everest Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity, Everest
Security and Mt. McKinley are subject to periodic financial examination (usually every 3
years) of their affairs by the insurance departments of the states in which they are
licensed, authorized or accredited. Everest Re’s, Everest Security’s, Everest
Indemnity’s and Mt. McKinley’s last examination reports were as of December 31,
2003, while Everest National’s last examination was as of December 31, 2001. None of
these reports contained any material findings or recommendations. In addition, U.S.
insurance companies are subject to examinations by the various state insurance departments
where they are licensed concerning compliance with applicable conduct of business
regulations.

NAIC Risk-Based Capital
Requirements.

The U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(“NAIC”) employs a formula to measure the amount of capital appropriate for a
property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in
light of its size and risk profile. The major categories of a company’s risk profile
are its asset risk, credit risk, and underwriting risk. The standards are an effort by the
NAIC to prevent insolvencies, to ward off other financial difficulties of insurance
companies and to establish uniform regulatory standards among state insurance departments.

Under the approved formula, a
company’s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital (“RBC”).
If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no action is necessary. Below this threshold
are four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees
of authority over a domestic insurer as the ratio of surplus to RBC decreases. The mildest
intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions. The
most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated.

Based on their financial positions at
December 31, 2006, Everest Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity and Everest Security
significantly exceed the minimum thresholds. Since Mt. McKinley ceased writing new and
renewal insurance in 1985, its domiciliary regulator, Delaware, has exempted Mt. McKinley
from complying with RBC requirements.

Various proposals to change the RBC
formula arise from time to time. The Company is unable to predict whether any such
proposal will be adopted, the form in which any such proposals would be adopted or the
effect, if any, the adoption of any such proposal or change in the RBC calculations would
have on the Company.

Tax Matters.

The
following summary of the taxation of the Company is based on current law. There can be no
assurance that legislative, judicial, or administrative changes will not be enacted that
materially affects this summary.

Bermuda.

Under Bermuda law, no income, withholding or capital gains taxes
          are imposed upon Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries. Group and its Bermuda
          subsidiaries have received an undertaking from the Minister of


Finance in
          Bermuda that, in the event of any taxes being imposed, Group and its Bermuda
          subsidiaries will be exempt from taxation in Bermuda until March 2016.
          Non-Bermuda branches of Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the
          jurisdictions in which they operate.

United States.

Group’s U.S. subsidiaries conduct business in and are subject to taxation in the
U.S. Non-U.S. branches of U.S. subsidiaries are subject to local taxation in the
jurisdictions in which they operate. Should the U.S. subsidiaries distribute current or
accumulated earnings and profits in the form of dividends or otherwise to Group, the
Company would be subject to withholding taxes. Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries believe
that they have operated and will continue to operate their businesses in a manner that
will not cause them to generate income treated as effectively connected with the conduct
of a trade or business within the U.S. On this basis, Group does not expect that it and
its Bermuda subsidiaries will be required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes other than
withholding taxes on certain investment income and premium excise taxes. If Group or its
Bermuda subsidiaries were to become subject to U.S. income tax; there could be a material
adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

United Kingdom.

Bermuda Re’s UK branch conducts business in the UK and is subject to taxation in the
UK. Bermuda Re believes that it has operated and will continue to operate its Bermuda
operation in a manner which will not cause them to be subject to UK taxation. If Bermuda
Re’s Bermuda operations were to become subject to UK income tax there could be a
material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
and cash flow.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information
provided in this report, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating
an investment in our securities. If the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk
factors materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common shares could decline
significantly.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR
BUSINESS

Our results could be
adversely affected by catastrophic events.

We are exposed to unpredictable
catastrophic events, including weather-related and other natural catastrophes, as well as
acts of terrorism. Any material reduction in our operating results caused by the
occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to
meet our interest and principal payment obligations. We define a catastrophe as an event
that causes a pre-tax loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least $5.0
million, before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. Effective for the third quarter
2005, industrial risk losses have been excluded from catastrophe losses, with prior
periods adjusted for comparison purposes. By way of illustration, during the past five
calendar years, pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of contract specific reinsurance but
before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs, were as follows:


Calendar year

Pre-tax catastrophe losses


$

287.9

million


$

1,485.7

million


$

390.0

million


$

35.0

million


$

30.0

million

Our losses from future
catastrophic events could exceed our projections.

We use projections of possible losses
from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic
underwriting tool. We use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe
losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the purchase of retrocessional coverage
or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area. These
loss projections are approximations reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative
processes and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount.

We focus on potential losses that can
be generated by any single event as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate
exposure to catastrophic events. Accordingly, we employ various techniques to estimate the
amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographical
areas. These techniques range from non-modeled deterministic approaches – such as
tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic damage
factors – to modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using
sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation techniques that provide insights into the frequency
and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis.

If our loss reserves are
inadequate to meet our actual losses, net income would be reduced or we could incur a
loss.

We are required to maintain reserves
to cover our estimated ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses for both
reported and unreported claims incurred. These reserves are only estimates of what we
believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and
circumstances known to us. In setting reserves for our reinsurance liabilities, we rely on
claim data supplied by our ceding companies and brokers and we employ actuarial and
statistical projections. The information received from our ceding companies is not always
timely or accurate, which can contribute to inaccuracies in our loss projections. Because
of the uncertainties that surround our estimates of loss and LAE reserves, we cannot be
certain that ultimate loss and LAE payments will not exceed our estimates. If our reserves
are deficient, we would be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which such
deficiencies are identified which would cause a charge to our earnings and a reduction of
capital. By way of illustration, during the past five calendar years, the reserve
re-estimation process resulted in a decrease to our pre-tax net income in four of the
years:

Calendar year

26.4

$

249.4

$

103.1

million decrease

See ITEM 1, “Business —
Changes in Historical Reserves,” which provides a more detailed chart showing the
effect of reserve re-estimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years.

The difficulty in estimating our
reserves is significantly more challenging as it relates to reserving for potential
A&E liabilities. At year-end 2006, roughly 7% of our gross reserves were comprised of
A&E reserves. A&E


liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons,
including the long delays between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property
damage, difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental
contamination, long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for
the asbestos or environmental damage. Legal tactics and judicial and legislative
developments affecting the scope of insurers’ liability, which can be difficult to
predict, also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for A&E liabilities.

The failure to accurately assess
underwriting risk and establish adequate premium rates could reduce our net income or
result in a net loss.

Our success depends on our ability to
accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained.
If we fail to accurately assess the risks we retain, we may fail to establish adequate
premium rates to cover our losses and LAE. This could reduce our net income and even
result in a net loss.

In addition, losses may arise from
events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced. An example of an
unanticipated event is the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Neither the magnitude
of loss on a single line of business nor the combined impact on several lines of business
from an act of terrorism on such a large scale was contemplated when we priced our
coverages. In addition to unanticipated events, we also face the unanticipated expansion
of our exposures, particularly in long-tail liability lines. An example of this is the
expansion over time of the scope of insurers’ legal liability within the mass tort
arena, particularly for A&E exposures discussed above.

Decreases in pricing for property
and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce our net income.

The worldwide reinsurance and
insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market.
These cycles, as well as other factors that influence aggregate supply and demand for
property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products, are outside of our control. The
supply of (re)insurance is driven by prevailing prices and levels of capacity that may
fluctuate in response to a number of factors including large catastrophic losses and
investment returns being realized in the insurance industry. Demand for (re)insurance is
influenced by underwriting results of insurers and insureds, including catastrophe losses,
and prevailing general economic conditions. If any of these factors were to result in a
decline in the demand for (re)insurance or an overall increase in (re)insurance capacity,
our net income could decrease.

If rating agencies downgrade the
ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, future prospects for growth and profitability could
be significantly and adversely affected.

Our active insurance company
subsidiaries currently hold financial strength ratings assigned by third-party rating
agencies which assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial strength of
insurers and reinsurers. Our active subsidiaries carry an “A+
(“Superior”)” rating from A.M. Best. Everest Re, Bermuda Re and Everest
National hold an “AA– (“Very Strong”)” rating from Standard &
Poor’s. Everest Re and Bermuda Re hold an “Aa3 (“Excellent”)”
rating from Moody’s. Financial strength ratings are used by client companies and
agents and brokers that place the business as an important means of assessing the
financial strength and quality of reinsurers. A downgrade or withdrawal of any of these
ratings might adversely affect our ability to market our insurance products and could have
a material and adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability.

During the last five years, no active
subsidiary of ours has experienced a financial strength rating downgrade. However, we
cannot assure that a downgrade will not occur in the future if we do not continue to meet
the evolving criteria expected of our current rating. In that regard, several of the
rating agencies are in the process of modifying their approaches to evaluating
catastrophic risk relative to their capital and risk management requirements. Therefore,
we cannot predict the outcome of this reassessment or its potential impact upon our
ratings.


Consistent with market practice, much
of our treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or
seek collateralization of our obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a
certain threshold. The termination provision would generally be triggered only if a rating
fell below A.M. Best’s A- rating level, which is three levels below Everest Re’s
current rating of A+. To a lesser extent, Everest Re also has modest exposure to
reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding
liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade. That provision would also generally
be triggered only if Everest Re’s rating fell below A.M. Best’s A- rating level.

The failure of our insureds,
intermediaries and reinsurers to satisfy their obligations to us could reduce our net
income.

In accordance with industry practice,
we have uncollateralized receivables from insureds, agents and brokers and/or rely on
agents and brokers to process our payments. We may not be able to collect amounts due from
insureds, agents and brokers, resulting in a reduction to net income.

We are also subject to the credit
risk of reinsurers in connection with retrocessional arrangements because the transfer of
risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to the insured. In addition,
reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us even though they are able to do so. The failure of
one or more of our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would
impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and could cause us to incur a significant
loss.

If we are unable or choose not to
purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers, our net income could be reduced or
we could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss experience.

We are generally less reliant on the
purchase of reinsurance than many of our competitors, in part because of our strategic
emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in our business.
We try to separate our risk taking process from our risk mitigation process in order to
avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance. Thus, we generally evaluate,
underwrite, select and price our products prior to consideration of reinsurance. However,
our underwriters generally consider purchasing reinsurance with respect to specific
insurance contracts or programs, and our senior management generally considers purchasing
reinsurance with respect to potential accumulations of exposures across some or all of our
operations, where reinsurance is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or is
expected to have a positive cost/benefit relationship. Because we generally purchase
reinsurance only when we expect a net benefit, the percentage of business that we
reinsure, as indicated below, varies considerably from year to year, depending on our view
of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract period.

Changes in the availability and cost
of reinsurance, which are subject to market conditions that are outside of our control,
have thus reduced to some extent our ability to use reinsurance to tailor the risks we
assume on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance exposures across our
reinsurance operations. Because we have reduced our level of reinsurance purchases in
recent years, our net income could be reduced following a large unreinsured event or
adverse overall claims experience.

Our industry is highly competitive
and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future.

Our industry is highly competitive
and subject to pricing cycles that can be pronounced. We compete globally in the U.S.,
Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous competitors. Our
competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or
affiliates of established


worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of
certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations,
including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s.

According to Standard &
Poor’s, we rank among the top ten global reinsurance groups, in which 80% of the
market share is concentrated. The top twenty groups in our industry represent 95% of the
market’s revenues. The leaders in this market are Munich Re, Swiss Re (including
Employers Re), Berkshire Hathaway, Hannover Re, and syndicates at Lloyd’s. Some of
these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established
long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be a
significant competitive advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into
the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance
risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and
insurance capacity and competition. We may not be able to compete successfully in the
future should there be a significant change to the competitive landscape of our market.

We are dependent on our
key personnel.

Our success has been, and will
continue to be, dependent on the ability to retain the services of existing key executive
officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss
of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain other
highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct
business. Generally, we consider key executive officers to be those individuals who have
the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling operations: Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, Joseph V. Taranto (age 57), President and Chief Operating
Officer, Thomas J. Gallagher (age 58), and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, Craig Eisenacher (age 59). Of those three officers, we have employment contracts
with Mr. Taranto and Mr. Eisenacher. Mr. Taranto’s contract has been previously filed
with the SEC and was most recently amended on August 31, 2005 to extend Mr. Taranto’s
term of employment from March 31, 2006 until March 31, 2008. Mr. Eisenacher’s
contract has been previously filed with the SEC on December 5, 2006 for a term of
employment from December 18, 2006 until December 19, 2008. We are not aware that any of
the above three officers are planning to leave Group or retire in the near future. We do
not maintain any key employee insurance on any of our employees.

Special considerations apply to our
Bermuda operations. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians, other than spouses of Bermudians
and individuals holding permanent resident certificates, are not permitted to engage in
any gainful occupation in Bermuda without a work permit issued by the Bermuda government.
A work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that, after a proper
public advertisement, no Bermudian, spouse of a Bermudian or individual holding a
permanent resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards for the
position. The Bermuda government places a six-year term limit on individuals with work
permits, subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees of
businesses with a significant physical presence in Bermuda. Currently, all seven of our
Bermuda-based professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by
the Bermuda government that expire at various times between March 2006 and December 2008.
This includes Mark de Saram, the chief executive officer of our Bermuda reinsurance
operation. In the event his work permit were not renewed, we could lose his services,
thereby adversely affecting our ability to conduct our business in Bermuda until we were
able to replace him with an individual in Bermuda who did not require a work permit or who
was granted the permit. The Company has an employment contract with Mr. de Saram, which
was previously filed with the SEC and was most recently amended on October 31, 2006 to
extend Mr. de Saram’s term of employment from November 1, 2006 until November 1,
2008.

Our investment values and
investment income could decline because they are exposed to interest rate, credit, and
market risks.

A significant portion of our
investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and smaller portions consist of
equity securities and other investments. Both the fair market value of our invested assets
and associated


investment income fluctuate depending on general economic and market
conditions. For example, the fair market value of our predominant fixed income portfolio
generally increases or decreases inversely to fluctuations in interest rates. The fair
market value of our fixed income securities could also decrease as a result of downturn in
the business cycle that causes the credit quality of such securities to deteriorate. The
net investment income that we realize from future investments in fixed income securities
will generally increase or decrease with interest rates.

Interest rate fluctuations also can
cause net investment income from fixed income investments that carry prepayment risk, such
as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, to differ from the income
anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase. In addition, if issuers of
individual investments are unable to meet their obligations, investment income will be
reduced and realized capital losses may arise.

Because all of our fixed income
securities are classified as available for sale, temporary changes in the market value of
these investments as well as equities are reflected as changes to our shareholders’
equity. As a result, a decline in the value of the securities in our portfolio reduces our
capital or could cause us to incur a loss.

We have invested a growing portion of
our investment portfolio in common stock or equity-related securities. The value of these
assets fluctuate with equity markets. In times of economic weakness, the market value and
liquidity of these assets may decline, and may negatively impact net income and capital.
We also invest in non-traditional investments which have different risk characteristics
than traditional fixed income and equity securities. These alternative investments are
comprised primarily of private equity limited partnerships. The changes in value and
investment income/(loss) for these partnerships are more volatile than over-the-counter
securities.

The following table quantifies the
portion of our investment portfolio that consists of fixed income securities, equity
securities and investments that carry prepayment risk.

We may experience foreign currency
exchange losses that reduce our net income and capital levels.

Through our Bermuda and international operations,
we conduct business in a variety of foreign (non-U.S.) currencies, principally the Euro,
the British pound, the Canadian dollar, and the Singapore dollar. Assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency
exchange rates. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and exchange rate fluctuations
relative to the U.S. dollar may materially impact our results and financial position. In
2006, we wrote approximately 28.6% of our reinsurance coverages in non-U.S. currencies; as
of December 31, 2006, we maintained approximately 13.3% of our investment portfolio in
investments denominated in non-U.S. currencies. During 2006, 2005, 2004, the impact on our
quarterly pre-tax net income from exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of $6.5
million to a gain of $5.9 million.


RISKS RELATING TO
REGULATION

Insurance laws and regulations
restrict our ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We are subject to extensive and
increasing regulation under U.S., state and foreign insurance laws. These laws limit the
amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our operating subsidiaries, impose
restrictions on the amount and type of investments that we can hold, prescribe solvency,
accounting and internal control standards that must be met and maintained and require us
to maintain reserves. These laws also require disclosure of material inter-affiliate
transactions and require prior approval of “extraordinary” transactions. Such
“extraordinary” transactions include declaring dividends from operating
subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds. These laws also generally require approval
of changes of control of insurance companies. The application of these laws could affect
our liquidity and ability to pay dividends, interest and other payments on securities, as
applicable, and could restrict our ability to expand business operations through
acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries. We may not have or maintain all required
licenses and approvals or fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and
regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations.
If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable
regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or
temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or monetarily
penalize us. These types of actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
To date, no material fine, penalty or restriction has been imposed on us for failure to
comply with any insurance law or regulation.

Current legal and regulatory
activities related to the insurance industry, including investigations into contingent
commission arrangements and certain finite risk or non-traditional products could affect
our business and the industry.

The insurance industry has
experienced uncertainty and negative publicity as a result of current litigation,
investigations, and regulatory activity by various insurance, governmental, and
enforcement authorities, including the SEC, with regard to certain practices within the
insurance industry. These practices include the payment of contingent commissions by
insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents, the solicitation and provision of
fictitious or inflated quotes, and the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or
other non-traditional, loss mitigation insurance and reinsurance products.

At this time, it appears the effects
of these investigations will have more of an impact on specific companies being
investigated rather than the industry as a whole, with greater transparency and financial
reporting disclosures being required for the entire industry in these areas; however, the
future impact, if any, on our operation, net income or financial condition can not be
determined at this time.

RISKS RELATING TO
GROUP’S SECURITIES

Because of our holding company
structure, our ability to pay dividends, interest and principal is dependent on our
receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from our subsidiaries.

Group and Holdings are holding
companies, each of whose most significant assets consists of the stock of their operating
subsidiaries. As a result, each of Group’s and Holdings’ ability to pay
dividends, interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the
earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries
to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it. This ability is subject to general
economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Payment
of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating subsidiaries are
regulated by U.S., state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions, including
minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. Accordingly,
the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to
us and


Holdings in the future, which could prevent us from paying dividends, interest or
other payments on our securities.

Provisions in Group’s
bye-laws could have an anti-takeover effect, which could diminish the value of its common
shares.

Group’s bye-laws contain
provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to
replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In addition,
these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might
consider favorable. The effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from
receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered
by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change
in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing
market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in
the future.

For example, Group’s bye-laws
contain the following provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect:

•

election of directors is
staggered, meaning that the members of only one of three classes of directors are selected
each year;

•

shareholders have limited ability to remove directors;

•

the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 9.9% of the common shares will
be reduced to 9.9% of the total voting power of the common shares;

•

the board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has
reason to believe that the transfer would result in:

i)  any person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more than 5.0%
                    of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of Group,

ii)  any person holding controlled shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the
                    issued and outstanding share capital of Group, or

iii)  any adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to Group, any of its
                    subsidiaries or any of its shareholders;

•

Group also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholder’s common
shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or advisable to
avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if:

i)  any person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than 5.0%
                    of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of Group,

ii)  any person holds controlled shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the issued
                    and outstanding share capital of Group, or

iii)  share ownership by any person may result in adverse tax, regulatory or legal
                    consequences to Group, any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder.

The Board of Directors has indicated
that it will apply these bye-law provisions in such manner that “passive institutional investors” will be treated similarly to investment companies. For this
purpose, “passive


institutional investors” include all persons who are eligible,
pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b)(1) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to file a
short-form statement on Schedule 13G, other than an insurance company or any parent
holding company or control person of an insurance company.

Applicable insurance laws
may also have an anti-takeover effect.

Before a person can acquire control
of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance
commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled. Prior to granting
approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company, a state
insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the
applicant, the integrity and competence of the applicant’s board of directors and
executive officers, the acquiror’s plans for changes to the insurance company’s
board of directors and executive officers, the acquiror’s plans for the future
operations of the insurance company and any anti-competitive results that may arise from
the consummation of the acquisition of control. Because any person who acquired control of
Group would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries in the
U.S., the insurance change of control laws of Delaware, California and Georgia would apply
to such a transaction. This could have the effect of delaying or even preventing such a
change of control.

Investors in Group may have more
difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a U.S. corporation.

The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda
(the “Companies Act”), differs in material respects from the laws applicable to
U.S. corporations and their shareholders. The following is a summary of material
differences between the Companies Act, as modified in some instances by provisions of
Group’s bye-laws, and Delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for
investors in Group to protect their interests than investors in a U.S. corporation.
Because the following statements are summaries, they do not address all aspects of Bermuda
law that may be relevant to Group and its shareholders.

Alternate
Directors.

Group’s bye-laws provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that
each director may appoint an alternate director, who shall have the power to attend and
vote at any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not
personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director. Delaware law
does not provide for alternate directors.

Committees of the Board of
Directors.

Group’s bye-laws provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that
the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board
appoints, and those committees may consist partly or entirely of non-directors. Delaware
law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to
committees, but those committees may consist only of directors.

Interested
Directors.

Bermuda law and Group’s bye-laws provide that if a director
has a personal interest in a transaction to which the company is also a party and if the
director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity, either
at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors, then the company will not be
able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest
and the director will not be liable to the company for any profit realized from the
transaction. In addition, after a director has made the declaration of interest referred
to above, he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum
is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest, unless
disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting. Under Delaware
law, an interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director
derived an improper personal benefit. Additionally, under Delaware law, a corporation may
be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the
following conditions is fulfilled:

•

the material facts as to the interested director’s relationship or interests are
disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes
the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors,


•

material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the
transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a
majority of the voting shares; or

•

the transaction is fair to the
corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified.

Transactions with Significant
Shareholders.

As a Bermuda company, Group may enter into business
transactions with its significant shareholders, including asset sales, in which a
significant shareholder receives, or could receive, a financial benefit that is greater
than that received, or to be received, by other shareholders with prior approval from
Group’s board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the
shareholders. In the case of an amalgamation, in which two or more companies join together
and continue as a single company, a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of
at least 75% of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of
directors, except in the case of an amalgamation with and between wholly-owned
subsidiaries. If
Group was a Delaware corporation, any business combination with an interested shareholder
(which, for this purpose, would include mergers and asset sales of greater than 10% of
Group’s assets that would otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course
of business) within a period of three years from the time the person became an interested
shareholder would require prior approval from shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of
Group’s outstanding common shares not owned by the interested shareholder, unless the
transaction qualified for one of the exemptions in the relevant Delaware statute or Group
opted out of the statute. For purposes of the Delaware statute, an “interested
shareholder” is generally defined as a person who together with that person’s
affiliates and associates owns, or within the previous three years did own, 15% or more of
a corporation’s outstanding voting shares.

Takeovers.

Under Bermuda law, if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and,
          within four months of the offer, the holders of not less than 90% of the shares
          that are the subject of the offer tender their shares, the acquiror may give the
          nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the
          terms of the offer. Within one month of receiving the notice, dissenting
          shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer. The burden is on
          the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its
          discretion to enjoin the transfer. The court will be unlikely to do this unless
          there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and
          the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders.
          Under another provision of Bermuda law, the holders of 95% of the shares of a
          company (the “acquiring shareholders”) may give notice to the
          remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms
          described in the notice. Within one month of receiving the notice, dissenting
          shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their shares. Within one
          month of the court’s appraisal, the acquiring shareholders are entitled
          either to acquire all shares involved at the price fixed by the court or cancel
          the notice given to the remaining shareholders. If shares were acquired under
          the notice at a price below the court’s appraisal price, the acquiring
          shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and
          return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder, who must then refund the
          purchase price. There are no comparable provisions under Delaware law.

Inspection of Corporate
Records.

Members of the general public have the right to inspect the public
documents of Group available at the office of the Registrar of Companies and Group’s
registered office, both in Bermuda. These documents include the memorandum of association,
which describes Group’s permitted purposes and powers, any amendments to the
memorandum of association and documents relating to any increase or reduction in
Group’s authorized share capital. Shareholders of Group have the additional right to
inspect Group’s bye-laws, minutes of general meetings of shareholders and audited
financial statements that must be presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders.
The register of shareholders of Group also is open to inspection by shareholders without
charge, and to members of the public for a fee. Group is required to maintain its share
register at its registered office in Bermuda. Group also maintains a branch register in
the offices of its transfer agent in the U.S., which is open for public inspection as
required under the Companies Act. Group is required to keep at its registered office a
register of its directors and officers that is open for inspection by members of the
public without charge. However, Bermuda law does not provide a general right for
shareholders to inspect


or obtain copies of any other corporate records. Under Delaware
law, any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporation’s shareholder list
and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that person’s
interest as a shareholder.

Shareholder’s
Suits.

The rights of shareholders under Bermuda law are not as extensive as
the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many U.S.
jurisdictions. Class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to
shareholders under the laws of Bermuda. However, the Bermuda courts ordinarily would be
expected to follow English case law precedent, which would permit a shareholder to bring
an action in the name of Group to remedy a wrong done to Group where the act complained of
is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of Group or illegal or would result in the
violation of Group’s memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, the court
would give consideration to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the
minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of
Group’s shareholders than actually approved it. The winning party in an action of
this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys’ fees incurred in
connection with the action. Under Delaware law, class actions and derivative actions
generally are available to stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and
actions not taken in accordance with applicable law. In these types of actions, the court
has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys’ fees.

Limitation of Liability of
Directors and Officers.

Group’s bye-laws provide that Group and its
shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have, individually or in
the right of the Company, against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in
the performance of that director’s or officer’s duties. However, this waiver
does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud or dishonesty. This
waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws.
Under Delaware law, a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation
provisions limiting the personal liability of its directors to the corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty. However,
these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or
omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, the authorization of unlawful dividends, stock repurchases or stock redemptions,
or any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit. Moreover,
Delaware provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under U.S. federal
securities laws.

Indemnification of Directors
and Officers.

Group’s bye-laws provide that Group shall indemnify its
directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions, costs,
charges, liabilities, loss, damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of
any act done, concurred in or omitted in the conduct of Group’s business or in the
discharge of their duties. Under Bermuda law, this indemnification may not extend to any
matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in
relation to the company, as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to
appeal. Under Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes
a party to an action, suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer
if (1) the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and (2) if the action or
proceeding involves a criminal offense, the director or officer had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

Enforcement of Civil
Liabilities.

Group is organized under the laws of Bermuda. Some of our
directors and officers may reside outside the U.S. A substantial portion of our assets are
or may be located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. A person may not be able to effect
service of process within the U.S. on directors and officers of Group and those experts
who reside outside the U.S. A person also may not be able to recover against them or Group
on judgments of U.S. courts or to obtain original judgments against them or Group in
Bermuda courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S.
federal securities laws.

Dividends.

Bermuda law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend, or make a
          distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for
          believing that a company, after the payment is made,


would be unable to pay its
          liabilities as they become due, or that the realizable value of a company’s
          assets would be less, as a result of the payment, than the aggregate of its
          liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. The share
          capital account represents the aggregate par value of a company’s issued
          shares, and the share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for
          issued shares over and above their par value. Under Delaware law, subject to any
          restrictions contained in a company’s certificate of incorporation, a
          company may pay dividends out of the surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of
          net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the
          preceding fiscal year. Surplus is the amount by which the net assets of a
          corporation exceed its stated capital. Delaware law also provides that dividends
          may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than
          the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a
          preference upon the distribution of assets.

RISKS RELATING TO TAXATION

If U.S. tax law changes,
our net income may be reduced.

In the last few years, some members
of Congress have expressed concern about U.S. corporations that move their place of
incorporation to low-tax jurisdictions. Also, some members of Congress have expressed
concern over a competitive advantage that foreign-controlled insurers and reinsurers may
have over U.S. controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by
U.S. insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions, including Bermuda.
Although the existing legislation that increases the U.S. tax burden on so-called
“inverting” companies does not apply to us, we do not know whether any similar
legislation disadvantageous to our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries will ever be enacted
into law. If it were enacted, the U.S. tax burden on our Bermuda operations, or on some
business ceded from our licensed U.S. insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers,
could be increased. This would reduce our net income.

Group and/or Bermuda Re may be
subject to U.S. corporate income tax, which would reduce our net income.

Bermuda Re.

The income
of Bermuda Re is a significant portion of our worldwide income from operations. We have
established guidelines for the conduct of our operations that are designed to ensure that
Bermuda Re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. Based on its
compliance with those guidelines, we believe that Bermuda Re should not be required to pay
U.S. corporate income tax, other than withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income.
However, if the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) were to successfully contend
that Bermuda Re was engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., Bermuda Re would be
required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on any income that is subject to the taxing
jurisdiction of the U.S., and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax. Even if the IRS were
to successfully contend that Bermuda Re was engaged in a U.S. trade or business, we
believe that the U.S.-Bermuda tax treaty would preclude the IRS from taxing Bermuda
Re’s income except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by that subsidiary. We do not believe that Bermuda Re has a
permanent establishment in the U.S. If the IRS were to successfully contend that Bermuda
Re did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the U.S., Bermuda Re would
be subject to U.S. tax on that income.

Group.

We conduct our operations in a manner designed to minimize our U.S. tax
          exposure. Based on our compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that we
          generate only immaterial amounts, if any, of income that is subject to the
          taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., we believe that we should be required to pay
          only immaterial amounts, if any, of U.S. corporate income tax, other than
          withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income. However, if the IRS successfully
          contended that we had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing
          jurisdiction of the U.S., we would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax
          on that income, and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax. Prior to January 1,
          2005, our principal executive offices were located in Barbados and, as a result,
          even if the IRS had successfully contended that we had material amounts of
          income that was subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., we believe that
          the U.S.-Barbados tax treaty would have precluded the IRS from taxing our
          income, except to the extent that our income was attributable to a permanent
          establishment


maintained by us in the U.S. Since we moved our principal
          executive offices out of Barbados as of December 31, 2004 and since the United
          States and Barbados recently made effective a protocol to the U.S.-Barbados tax
          treaty that strengthens the limitation of benefits provisions of that treaty,
          the U.S.-Barbados tax treaty will no longer provide any protection to us.
          Nevertheless, we do not believe that we have material amounts of income subject
          to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S. If the IRS successfully contended,
          however, that we did have income subject to tax in the U.S., the imposition of
          tax on that income would reduce our net income.

If Bermuda Re became subject to U.S.
income tax on its income or if we became subject to U.S. income tax, our income could also
be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax. In that event, Group and Bermuda Re would be
subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as
U.S. corporations. The combined effect of the 35% U.S. corporate income tax rate and the
30% branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 54.5%. The imposition of these taxes
would reduce our net income.

Group and/or Bermuda Re may become
subject to Bermuda tax, which would reduce our net income.

Group and Bermuda Re are not subject
to income or capital gains taxes in Bermuda. Both companies have received an assurance
from the Bermuda Minister of Finance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act
1966 of Bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that imposes
any tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or
appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then that tax
will not apply to us or to any of our operations or our shares, debentures or other
obligations until March 28, 2016. This assurance does not prevent the application of any
of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda and does not prevent the
imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land Tax Act 1967
of Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to Group or Bermuda Re.
There are currently no procedures for extending these assurances. As a result, Group and
Bermuda Re could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which would reduce
our net income.

Our net income will be reduced if
U.S. excise and withholding taxes are increased.

Bermuda Re is subject to an excise
tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums it collects with respect to risks located in the
U.S. In addition, Bermuda Re may be subject to withholding tax on dividend income from
U.S. sources. These taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on
Bermuda Re’s business, which would reduce our net income.

Properties

Everest Re’s corporate offices
are located in approximately 129,700 square feet of leased office space in Liberty Corner,
New Jersey. Bermuda Re’s corporate offices are located in approximately 3,600 total
square feet of leased office space in Hamilton, Bermuda. The Company’s other thirteen
locations occupy a total of approximately 75,000 square feet, all of which are leased.
Management believes that the above-described office space is adequate for its current and
anticipated needs.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business,
the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute
resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the Company’s rights and


obligations under insurance, reinsurance and other contractual agreements. In some
disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds
owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others to collect
funds or enforce alleged rights. These disputes arise from time to time and as they arise
are addressed, and ultimately resolved, through both informal and formal means, including
negotiated resolution, arbitration and litigation. In all such matters, the Company
believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. While the final
outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe
that any of these matters, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position or liquidity. However, an adverse resolution of one
or more of these items in any one quarter or fiscal year could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s results of operations in that period.

In May 2005, Holdings received and
responded to a subpoena from the SEC seeking information regarding certain loss mitigation
insurance products. The Company has stated that Holdings will fully cooperate with this
and any future inquiries and Holdings provided the requested information. Holdings does
not believe that it has engaged in any improper business practices with respect to loss
mitigation insurance products.

The Company’s insurance
subsidiaries have also received and have responded to broadly distributed information
requests by state regulators including among others, from Delaware and Georgia.

Dividend History and
Restrictions

In 1995, the Board of Directors of
the Company established a policy of declaring regular quarterly cash dividends and has
paid a regular quarterly dividend in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 1995. The
Company declared and paid its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share for the
first three quarters of 2006, $0.24 per share for the fourth quarter of 2006 and $0.11 per
share for each quarter of 2005. A committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
declared a dividend of $0.48 per share, payable on or before March 23, 2007 to
shareholders of record on March 5, 2007.

The declaration and payment of future
dividends, if any, by the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and
will depend upon many factors, including the Company’s earnings, financial condition,
business needs and growth objectives, capital and surplus requirements of its operating
subsidiaries, regulatory restrictions, rating agency considerations and other factors. As
an insurance holding company, the Company is partially dependent on dividends and other
permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. The
payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to
Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re is
subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. See “Regulatory Matters –
Dividends” and Note 14A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Selected
Financial Data

The following selected consolidated
GAAP financial data of the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,
2004, 2003 and 2002 were derived from the consolidated financial statements of the
Company, which were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The following financial data
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes.


(1)
               Catastrophe losses are presented net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums.
               A catastrophe is defined, for purposes of the Selected Consolidated Financial
               Data, as an event that caused a pre-tax loss on property exposures before
               reinsurance of at least $5.0 million before corporate level reinsurance and
               taxes. Effective in 2005, industrial risk losses have been excluded from
               catastrophe losses with prior periods adjusted for comparison purposes.
               Catastrophe reinsurance provides coverage for one event. When limits are
               exhausted, some contractual arrangements provide for the availability of
               additional coverage upon the payment of additional premium. This additional
               premium is referred to as reinstatement premium.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

The following is a discussion of the
results of operations and financial condition of the Company. This discussion and analysis
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data”.

INDUSTRY CONDITIONS

The worldwide reinsurance and
insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market.
Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the Company
underwrites is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength
of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or
S&P, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is
licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other
terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered,
speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written. These factors
operate at the individual market participant level to varying degrees, as applicable to
the specific participant’s circumstances. They also operate in aggregate across the
reinsurance industry more generally, contributing, in combination with economic conditions
and variations in the reinsurance buying practices of insurance companies (by participant
and in the aggregate), to cyclical movements in reinsurance rates, terms and conditions
and ultimately reinsurance industry aggregate financial results.

The Company competes in the U.S.,
Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global
competitors. The Company’s competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance
companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies,
reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international
underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s. Some of these
competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and have established
long-term and continuing business relationships, which can be a significant competitive
advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business
and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital
markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and
competition.

In 2006, the Company observed strong
price increases, and more restricted limits, in those property lines and regions that were
most affected by the catastrophe events of 2005, principally Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma. Reinsurance capacity in these areas was constrained, particularly for catastrophe
reinsurance, which includes southeastern U.S. exposures and in the retrocession and energy
lines. The record catastrophe losses of 2005 have also generally led to modest
strengthening for U.S. property lines that have little or no substantive catastrophe
exposure and price stabilization in most casualty insurance and reinsurance markets.
However, certain of the Company’s U.S. casualty lines continue to exhibit weaker
market conditions led by the medical stop loss and D&O reinsurance classes, as well as
the California workers’ compensation insurance line. The Company believes that U.S.
casualty reinsurance generally remains adequately priced; however, increased price
competition at the insurance company level and cedants’ increased appetite for
retaining more profitable business net following several years of hard-market conditions,
may result in modestly softer reinsurance pricing. The Company’s U.S. insurance
operation is less affected by these standard casualty insurance market conditions given
its specialty insurance program orientation. Finally, the Company continues to observe
generally stable property reinsurance market conditions in most countries outside of the
U.S., except for hardening property market conditions in Mexico following Hurricane Wilma,
while casualty rates are softening.

U.S.
          property reinsurance market conditions tightened, particularly within peak
          catastrophe zones, during 2006. This market hardening was particularly
          pronounced in third quarter renewals with incrementally higher rate changes and
          even more restrictive coverage terms than earlier in 2006. As a result, many
          reinsurance buyers were not able to fully place their reinsurance program and
          have been forced to raise retention levels and/or


reduce catastrophe limit
          purchases. In turn, insurance companies continue to adjust limits and coverages
          and increase the premium rates they charge their customers. Together, these
          trends have generally resulted in insurance companies retaining more property
          risk exposure and being more prone to potential future earnings volatility than
          in past years. This trend reflects an imbalance between reinsurance supply and
          demand. As a result of this imbalance and higher rates, additional competition
          is entering the market in the form of new companies and alternative risk
          transfer mechanisms. In January 2007, the Florida legislature enacted insurance
          reform that increases insurer’s access to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe
          Fund, thus potentially reducing the amount of reinsurance purchased from the
          private reinsurance market. The Company is unable to predict the impact on
          future market conditions from the increased competition and legislative reform.
          In addition to these market forces, reinsurers continue to reassess their risk
          appetites and rebalance their property portfolios to reflect improved price to
          exposure metrics against the backdrop of: (i) recent revisions to the
          industry’s catastrophe loss projection models, which are indicating
          significantly higher loss potentials and consequently higher pricing
          requirements and (ii) elevated rating agency scrutiny and capital requirements
          for many catastrophe exposed companies.

In light of its 2005 catastrophe
experience, the Company reexamined its risk management practices, concluded that its
control framework operated generally as intended and made appropriate portfolio
adjustments to its property reinsurance operations during the first nine months of 2006.
This portfolio repositioning, particularly within peak catastrophe zones, including
Southeast U.S., Mexico and Gulf of Mexico, has enabled the Company to benefit from these
dislocated markets by carefully shifting the mix of its writings toward the most
profitable classes, lines, customers and territories and enhancing portfolio balance and
diversification.

Overall, the Company believes that
current marketplace conditions offer solid opportunities for the Company given its strong
ratings, distribution system, reputation and expertise. The Company continues to employ
its opportunistic strategy of targeting those segments offering the greatest profit
potential, while maintaining balance and diversification in its overall portfolio.


FINANCIAL SUMMARY

The Company’s management
monitors and evaluates overall Company performance based upon financial results. The
following table displays a summary of the consolidated net income (loss), ratios and
shareholders’ equity for the years indicated:

The Company’s 2006 results were
very strong with net income of $840.8 million compared to a net loss of $218.7 million for
2005. This significant earnings improvement reflects the favorable effect of a benign U.S.
hurricane season relative to unprecedented Company and industry hurricane losses
experienced in 2005, as well as favorable underlying underwriting fundamentals.


Gross written premiums declined for
2006 compared to 2005 as the Company continued its disciplined underwriting and risk
management practices. In particular, the Company repositioned its U.S. property
reinsurance portfolio resulting in improved pricing, but lower premium volume. The premium
volume decline also reflects much lower premiums due to the run-off insurance credit
program business and a cut back in treaty casualty writings in response to market
softening in many U.S. casualty reinsurance classes.

Investment income increased from the
growth of the invested asset base and greater income from limited partnership investments.

The Company’s shareholders’
equity increased by $1.0 billion to $5.1 billion in 2006, principally attributable to the
record net income generated during the year. This compares to an increase of $0.4 billion
to $4.1 billion in 2005.

Revenues.

Gross and net written premiums declined 2.6% and 2.4%, respectively, for 2006
          compared to 2005, while net premiums earned declined 2.8% in 2006 compared to
          2005. The decrease in full year net premiums earned was primarily due to a
          decline in the U.S. insurance segment of 7.5%, reflective of: i) a reduction in
          credit business from an auto loan insurance program which is in run-off; and ii)
          continued reductions in the California workers’ compensation writings due
          to competitive market conditions. In addition, net premiums earned for the
          worldwide reinsurance segments in the aggregate decreased by 1.5% for 2006,
          reflecting multiple segment level factors, including a significant return
          premium for a Florida property quota share contract cancelled in 2006, the
          absence of sizable reinstatement premiums triggered in 2005 from severe
          catastrophic events, as well as the exercise of continued underwriting
          disciplines which emphasizes potential profitability over volume.

Net investment income increased 20.4%
for 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting continued year-over-year growth in invested assets
from positive cash flow from operations and a $43.2 million increase in income from
limited partnership investments. The average investment portfolio yields for 2006 were
4.6% pre-tax and 4.0% after-tax, slightly higher compared to the prior year.

Net realized capital gains were
modest in relation to the Company’s invested asset base, mainly reflecting normal
portfolio management activities in response to changes in interest rates and credit
spreads.

Expenses.

The Company’s incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses
          (“LAE”) decreased 34.6% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the
          relative absence of current year catastrophe losses.

The Company’s loss ratio
improvement of 31 points for 2006 compared to 2005 included a 30 point improvement due to
the relative absence of current year catastrophes.

Commission, brokerage, and tax
expenses decreased by 3.5% in 2006 from 2005. The 2.8% decline in earned premiums in 2006
compared to 2005 was the principal driver of the decrease in this directly variable
expense. Other underwriting expenses for 2006 increased by 6.3% compared to 2005, all due
to growth in corporate non-allocated expenses.

The Company’s effective income
tax rate for 2006 was 15.2% compared with the effective tax rate for 2005 of 22.2%, which
was impacted by the large catastrophe losses.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property
and casualty, treaty and facultative reinsurance, through reinsurance brokers, as well as
directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance operation writes
property and casualty insurance primarily through general agents and


surplus lines brokers
within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and
surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding
companies. The International operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through
Everest Re’s branches in Canada and Singapore, in addition to foreign business
written through Everest Re’s Miami and New Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation
provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and
reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies from its
Bermuda office and reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK
branch.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, with respect to
pricing, risk management, control of aggregate exposures to catastrophic events, capital,
investments and support operations. Management monitors and evaluates the financial
performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results.
Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and
brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in
particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which,
respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting
expenses by earned premium. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance but such
reinsurance generally does not impact segment results, as business is generally reported
within the segment in which the business was produced. For selected financial information
regarding these segments, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following tables present the

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006
COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005

Premiums Written.

Gross
written premiums decreased 2.6% to $4,000.9 million in 2006 from $4,108.6 million in 2005.
The Specialty Underwriting operation decreased 20.2% ($63.4 million), driven by a $53.2
million reduction in A&H premiums, as pricing for this business continues to be
difficult and a $23.6 million decrease in marine and aviation premiums, partially offset
by a $13.4 million increase in surety premiums. The U.S. Insurance operation decreased
7.1% ($66.2 million), mainly reflecting continued reductions in the California
workers’ compensation business and run-off of the credit business. The U.S.
Reinsurance operation decreased 3.6% ($49.4 million), principally reflecting a $72.7
million decrease in treaty casualty business, partially offset by a $16.4 million increase
in treaty property business and by an $11.6 million increase in facultative business.
Partially offsetting these declines was a 6.0% ($46.2 million) increase in the Bermuda
operation, reflecting increases in treaty business in the UK, Europe and Bermuda,
partially offset by decreased facultative business in Bermuda. The International operation
increased 3.6% ($25.2 million), primarily due to a $47.1 million increase in international
business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices, representing primarily Latin
American business and by a $22.8 million increase in Canadian business, partially offset
by a $44.1 million decrease in Asian business. The Company endeavors to write only
business that meets its profit criteria; generally, increases and decreases in a line of
business or region are the result of changing perceptions of the profit opportunities in
the various markets.

Ceded premiums decreased to $125.2
million in 2006 from $136.5 million in 2005. Ceded premiums generally relate to specific
reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and fluctuate based upon the level
of premiums written in the individual reinsured programs.

Net written premiums decreased by
2.4% to $3,875.7 million in 2006 from $3,972.0 million in 2005, reflecting the $107.7
million decrease in gross written premiums and the $11.4 million decrease in ceded
premiums.

Premium
Revenues.

Net premiums earned decreased by 2.8% to $3,853.2 million in 2006
from $3,963.1 million in 2005. Contributing to this decrease was an 18.9% ($57.0 million)
decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation, an 8.2% ($115.1 million) decrease in the
U.S. Reinsurance operation, a 7.5% ($61.3 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance
operation, partially offset by an 11.5% ($87.4 million) increase in the Bermuda operation
and a 5.3% ($36.0 million) increase in the International operation. Additional premiums,
related to catastrophe business, included in net earned premiums contributed $4.9 million
and $81.8 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The changes reflect period to period
changes in net written premiums and business mix, together with normal variability in
earning patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis
between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets, but also as
individual


contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in coverage,
structure, prices and/or terms and as new contracts are accepted. As premium reporting,
earnings, loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of individual
contracts, the continuous turnover of individual contracts, arising from both strategic
shifts and daily underwriting decisions, can and does introduce appreciable variability in
various underwriting line items. Changes in estimates of the reporting patterns of ceding
companies also affect premiums earned.

Expenses

Incurred Losses and
LAE.

The Company’s loss and LAE reserves reflect estimates of ultimate
claim liability. Such estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis, including
re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information
and, in particular, recently reported loss and claim experience related to prior periods.
The effect of such re-evaluations is recorded in incurred losses for the current period.

The following table shows the
components of the Company’s incurred losses and LAE for 2006 and 2005:

The Company’s incurred losses
and LAE decreased 34.6% to $2,434.4 million in 2006 from $3,724.3 million in 2005, due to
significantly reduced current year catastrophe losses and a reduction in current and prior
years attritional losses, partially offset by increased prior years reserve development on
catastrophe and A&E losses. Incurred losses and LAE in 2006 reflected ceded losses and
LAE of $109.5 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2005 of $95.2 million.

The Company’s loss ratio, which
is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by current year net premiums earned,
improved by 30.8 points to 63.2% over the comparable 2005 period, principally due to a
34.1 point improvement of current year catastrophe losses, partially offset by 4.2 points
related to an increase in prior years reserve strengthening.

The U.S. Reinsurance segment’s
incurred losses and LAE decreased 42.5%, or $628.4 million, for 2006 compared to 2005,
primarily due to significantly reduced current year catastrophe losses, principally within
the treaty property unit and decreased earned premiums. The segment’s loss ratio
improved by 39.6 points from 2005 due to a decrease in catastrophe losses, coupled with an
improvement in the overall attritional loss ratio. The segment’s attritional loss
ratio improvement generally results from more favorable current year pricing, principally
on the property business.

The U.S. Insurance segment’s
incurred losses and LAE decreased 2.0%, or $10.9 million, for 2006 as compared to 2005,
primarily due to reduced earned premiums, which related to the continued reduction in the
California workers’ compensation business and run-off of a credit program. The
segment’s loss ratio increased 3.8 points from 2005, primarily due to higher losses
on the credit program.

compared to 2005, primarily due to decreased catastrophe losses and a reduction in earned
premiums across all classes of business. Correspondingly, the segment’s loss ratio
improved by 38.5 points from 2005.

reflecting lower catastrophe losses. The segment’s loss ratio improved by 30.9 points
from 2005, primarily due to reduced current year catastrophe losses incurred in Canada,
Asia and international.

The Bermuda segment’s incurred
losses and LAE decreased 37.1%, or $304.8 million, for 2006 as compared to 2005. The
segment’s loss ratio improved by 47.2 points from 2005, due to a reduction in
catastrophe losses in the current year and an increase in favorable development on prior
period attritional reserves, partially offset by A&E reserve strengthening. The net
prior year improvement was more than offset by an increase in the current year attritional
losses reflecting increased earned premiums and a mix of business shift toward more
casualty business.

Underwriting Expenses.

The
Company’s expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net
premiums earned, was 26.5% for 2006 compared to 26.3% for 2005.

Segment underwriting expenses
decreased by 3.1% to $994.7 million for 2006 from $1,026.3 million in 2005. Commission,
brokerage, taxes and fees decreased by $31.6 million, principally due to decreases in
premium volume and changes in the mix and of business. Segment other underwriting expenses
were $0.1 million for both 2006 and 2005. Contributing to the segment underwriting expense
decreases were a 15.5% ($59.0 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, a 14.0%
($12.1 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation and a 6.8% ($12.5
million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance operation, partially offset by an 19.3% ($37.3
million) increase in the Bermuda operation and an 8.2% ($14.8 million) increase in the
International operation. The changes for each operation’s expenses principally
resulted from changes in commission expenses due to changes in premium volume and business
mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of specific reinsurance.

The Company’s combined ratio,
which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, decreased by 30.6 points to 89.7% in 2006
compared to 120.3% in 2005, as a result of lower catastrophe and attritional losses.


The following table shows the
combined ratios for each of the Company’s operating segments in 2006 and 2005. The
combined ratios for all operations were impacted by the loss and expense ratio variations
noted above.

Investment
Results.

Net investment income increased 20.4% to $629.4 million in 2006
from $522.8 million in 2005, primarily reflecting the growth in invested assets to $14.0
billion in 2006 from $13.0 billion in 2005 and a $43.2 million increase in investment
income from limited partnership investments. Investment income from equity investments in
limited partnerships fluctuates from year to year depending on the performance of the
individual investments made by the partnerships as well as the movement in the equity
markets. Period to period changes in investment income are also impacted by changes in the
level and mix of invested assets, prevailing interest rates and price movements in the
equity markets.

The Company, because of its historical
income orientation, had generally managed its investments to maximize reportable income.
Starting in 2004, the Company began investing a portion of its assets in equity
securities, principally in response to perceived changes in the relative attractiveness of
the debt and equity markets. In 2006, the Company added $330.5 million of equity
securities into the overall investment portfolio. The Company also added $180.4 million of
other invested assets, principally limited partnerships. The following table provides a

Net realized capital gains of $35.1
million in 2006 emanated from realized capital gains on the Company’s investments of
$49.0 million, resulting principally from gains on equity securities of $34.1 million and
fixed maturities of $14.9 million, partially offset by $13.9 million of realized capital
losses, resulting principally from losses on equity securities of $11.9 million and fixed
maturities of $2.0 million including $14.0 thousand from other than temporary market
declines. Net realized capital gains of $90.3 million in 2005, reflected realized capital
gains on the Company’s investments of $106.2 million, including $41.3 million on the
sale of interest only strips investments, partially offset by $15.9 million of realized
capital losses, which included $7.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of
interest only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance
with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and
Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial
Assets” (“EITF 99-20”).

The Company had issued seven equity
put options in prior years, which were outstanding at December 31, 2006. These products
meet the definition of derivatives under FAS 133. The Company recognized net derivative
expense of $0.4 million and $2.6 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, reflecting
changes in the fair value of the equity put options.

Corporate, Non-allocated
Expenses.

Corporate underwriting expenses not allocated to segments were
$26.5 million in 2006, compared to $18.4 million in 2005, primarily due to increase in
share-based compensation expense.

Interest, fees and bond issue cost
amortization expense in 2006 and 2005 were $69.9 million and $74.4 million, respectively.
Interest, fees and bond issue cost amortization expense in 2006 included $31.1 million
related to the senior notes, $37.5 million related to the junior subordinated debt
securities, $0.9 million related to the bond issue cost amortization and $0.4 million
related to the credit line under the Company’s revolving credit facilities. Interest,
fees and bond issue cost amortization expense in 2005 included $35.5 million related to
the senior notes, $37.5 million related to the junior subordinated debt securities, $1.0
million to the bond issue cost amortization and $0.4 million related to the credit line
under the Company’s revolving credit facilities. Interest expense on senior notes
decreased due to the retirement on March 15, 2005 of the 8.5% senior notes issued on March
14, 2000.

Other income in 2006 was $0.1 million
and other expense in 2005 was $11.1 million. The change was primarily due to the
fluctuation in foreign currency exchange.


Income Taxes.

The Company’s income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates
and corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with
the impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations in the effective tax rate
generally result from changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income among jurisdictions
with different tax rates. The Company recorded income tax expense of $150.9 million in
2006 compared to an income tax benefit of $62.3 million in 2005. The increase was
primarily due to the significant change in pre-tax income in 2006 compared to the pre-tax
loss in 2005.

Net Income
(Loss).

Net income was $840.8 million in 2006 compared to a net loss of
$218.7 million in 2005, primarily caused by much larger catastrophe losses in 2005 than in
2006.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2005 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

Premiums Written.

Gross
written premiums decreased 12.7% to $4,108.6 million in 2005 from $4,704.1 million in 2004
reflecting a disciplined underwriting response to modest reinsurance market softening that
affected all segments, resulting in an overall premium decline. Premiums declined 35.4%
($172.4 million) in the Specialty Underwriting operation, primarily due to a $145.4
million decrease in A&H business and a $47.9 million decrease in surety business,
partially offset by a $20.9 million increase in marine and aviation business. The U.S.
Insurance operation decreased 20.2% ($235.3 million), principally as a result of a $242.6
million decrease in workers’ compensation, resulting primarily from changes in the
California workers’ compensation market. The Bermuda operation decreased 13.0%
($114.7 million), reflecting declines in individual risk underwritten insurance and
reinsurance in Bermuda and in motor business reinsurance in the U.K. The U.S. Reinsurance
operation decreased 6.2% ($92.0 million), principally relating to a $173.1 million
decrease in treaty casualty business and a $29.3 million decrease in facultative business,
partially offset by a $118.9 million increase in treaty property business. The
International operation increased 2.8% ($18.9 million), resulting primarily from a $75.0
million increase in Asian business, partially offset by a $43.6 million decrease in
international business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices, representing
primarily Latin American business and an $11.3 million decrease in Canadian business.

Ceded premiums decreased to $136.5
million in 2005 from $172.6 million in 2004, principally resulting from the decrease in
gross premiums in the U.S. Insurance operations. Ceded premiums generally relate to
specific reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and fluctuate based upon
the level of premiums written in the individual reinsured programs.

Net written premiums decreased by
12.3% to $3,972.0 million in 2005 from $4,531.5 million in 2004, reflecting the $595.6
million decrease in gross written premiums and the $36.1 million decrease in ceded
premiums.

Premium
Revenues.

Net premiums earned decreased by 10.4% to $3,963.1 million in
2005 from $4,425.1 million in 2004. Contributing to this decrease was a 34.4% ($157.8
million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation, a 15.6% ($139.9 million)
decrease in the Bermuda operation, a 12.2% ($114.6 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance
operation and a 5.3% ($77.4 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, partially
offset by a 4.2% ($27.7 million) increase in the International operation. Partially
tempering the decline in net premiums earned in 2005 were $81.8 million of reinstatement
premiums of which $64.4 million were due to Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Generally,
catastrophe reinsurance provides coverage for one event; however, when limits are
exhausted, some contractual arrangements provide for the availability of additional
coverage upon the payment of additional premium. This additional premium is referred to as
reinstatement premium. There were no such reinstatement premiums for 2004. All of these
changes reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix,
together with normal variability in earnings patterns. Business mix changes occur not only
as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels
and markets, but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with
changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted
with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring
contracts. As premium reporting, earnings, loss and commission characteristics derive from
the provisions of individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual


contracts,
arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting, can and does introduce
appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items. Changes in
estimates related to the reporting patterns of ceding companies also affect premiums
earned.

Expenses

Incurred Losses and
LAE.

The Company’s loss and LAE reserves reflect estimates of ultimate
claim liability. Such estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis, including
re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information
and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience. The effect of such
re-evaluations impacts incurred losses for the current period.

The following table shows the
components of the Company’s incurred losses and LAE for 2005 and 2004:

(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)

The Company’s incurred losses
and LAE increased by 13.2% to $3,724.3 million in 2005 from $3,291.1 million in 2004. The
increase in incurred losses and LAE was principally attributable to the increase in
estimated losses due to property catastrophes, partially offset by favorable attritional
prior period reserve development and a lower level of earned premiums. Incurred losses and
LAE in 2005 reflected ceded losses and LAE of $95.2 million compared to ceded losses and
LAE in 2004 of $141.0 million.

The Company’s loss ratio, which
is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net premiums earned, increased by
19.6 percentage points to 94.0% in 2005 from 74.4% in 2004. This 19.6 point year over year
loss ratio increase was primarily the result of a 28.7 point increase due to catastrophe
losses, partially offset by a 10.2 point improvement in attritional and A&E prior year
reserve development.

Incurred losses and LAE include
catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable
and unfavorable development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance. Individual
catastrophe losses are reported net of specific reinsurance, but before recoveries under
corporate level reinsurance and potential incurred but not reported (“IBNR”)
loss reserve offsets. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $1,485.7
million in 2005, related principally to aggregate estimated losses driven by Hurricanes
Katrina, Rita and Wilma with catastrophe losses of $765.9 million, $151.0 million and
$381.6 million, respectively, but also reflected catastrophe losses related to hurricanes
Emily ($19.8 million) and Dennis ($7.0 million), floods in India ($13.2 million), Calgary
($9.6 million) and Europe ($6.2 million) and storms in Ontario ($12.9 million). The 2005
results also reflect net unfavorable reserve development on 2004 and prior catastrophes of
$118.5 million. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $390.0 million
in 2004, related principally to aggregate estimated losses of $428.8 million from
Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, Edmonton hailstorms and
the Asian tsunami, which were partially offset by $33.4 million of reserve reductions
related to the 2001 World Trade Center losses.


Net favorable prior period reserve
adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $26.4 million compared to net
unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments of $249.4 million in 2004. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the favorable reserve adjustments included net favorable attritional
reserve adjustments of $226.3 million related primarily to property business classes,
partially offset by net unfavorable prior period catastrophe adjustments of $118.5 million
related primarily to the 2004 hurricanes and net unfavorable A&E adjustments of $81.4
million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the unfavorable prior period reserve
adjustments included net unfavorable A&E adjustments of $159.4 million and net
unfavorable attritional development of approximately $128.7 million relating primarily to
casualty reinsurance. Partially offsetting the 2004 unfavorable development was $38.7
million of favorable catastrophe development principally related to the reduction of
reserves for the World Trade Center events. It is important to note that attritional
reserve development arises from the re-evaluation of accident year results and that such
re-evaluations may also impact premiums and commissions attributed by accident year,
generally mitigating, in part, the impact of loss developments and that such impacts are
recorded as part of the overall reserve evaluation process.

Aggregate reserve development related
to A&E exposures was $81.4 million and $159.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written
by the Company prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley
acquisition in September 2000. The reserve strengthening on business written by the
Company, net of reinsurance, was $11.5 million and the net strengthening on the acquired
Mt. McKinley business was $69.9 million in 2005. Substantially all of the Company’s
A&E exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods
prior to 1986. Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses,
management is unable to establish a meaningful range for these obligations.

The U.S. Reinsurance segment’s
incurred losses and LAE increased 26.6%, or $311.0 million, for 2005 as compared to 2004.
The segment’s loss ratio increased by 26.7 points over 2004 due to current year
catastrophe losses and unfavorable prior period catastrophe reserve adjustments, partially
offset by favorable attritional loss development.

The prior years unfavorable loss
development for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to a
proliferation of claims related to bankruptcies and other financial management
improprieties during the late 1990‘s and early 2000. This increased number of claims,
combined with larger claims, had significantly increased incurred losses on the
professional liability policies. In the general casualty area, the Company continued to
experience losses greater than historical trends for accident years 1998 through 2001.

The U.S. Insurance segment’s

The segment’s loss ratio improved by 5.8 points from 2004 primarily due to favorable
prior period adjustments principally on the California workers’ compensation business
for the 2004 accident year as the results of benefit reform have become clearer and the
2004 unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments related principally to the casualty
classes for accident years 2000 through 2002, where the Company strengthened its reserves
for California workers’ compensation insurance. While management believes the
cumulative results through 2005 remain quite positive, there was some deterioration in
claim frequency and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002.

The Specialty Underwriting
segment’s incurred losses and LAE increased 5.3%, or $15.9 million, for 2005 as
compared to 2004, due to the significant catastrophe losses in 2005 and development of
catastrophes from prior years. The segment’s loss ratio increased by 39.7 points over
2004, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses, however was partially offset by
favorable attritional loss development on the marine, aviation, surety and A&H classes
of business.

The segment’s loss ratio increased by 20.2 points over 2004, primarily reflective of
the significant property catastrophe losses in 2005 and development on prior years’
catastrophes, partially offset by an improvement in attritional prior year reserves on the
Canadian, Asian and international business.

The Bermuda segment’s incurred
losses and LAE increased 10.6%, or $78.7 million, for 2005 as compared to 2004. The
segment’s loss ratio increased by 25.6 points over 2004, reflecting catastrophe
losses in 2005 and prior period catastrophe development, partially offset by favorable
prior period attritional reserves, primarily from the UK branch produced business. The
A&E reserve development for both 2005 and 2004 primarily related to asbestos exposures
that were assumed through the September 19, 2000 loss portfolio transfer from Mt.
McKinley.

Underwriting Expenses.

The
Company’s expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net
premiums earned, was 26.3% for 2005 compared to 24.6% for 2004.

Segment underwriting expenses
decreased by 5.0% to $1,026.3 million in 2005 from $1,080.2 million in 2004. Commission,
brokerage, taxes and fees decreased by $60.3 million, principally reflecting decreases in
premium volume and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses
increased by $6.4 million as the Company continued to expand operations. Contributing to
the segment underwriting expense decreases were a 36.6% ($49.8 million) decrease in the
Specialty Underwriting operation, a 3.8% ($14.9 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance
operation and a 0.7% ($1.3 million) decrease in the Bermuda operation, partially offset by
a 4.2% ($7.2 million) increase in the International operation and a 2.7% ($4.9 million)
increase in the U.S. Insurance operation. The changes for each operation’s expenses
principally resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium
volume and business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of
specific reinsurance, as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business.

The Company’s combined ratio,
which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, increased by 21.3 percentage points to
120.3% in 2005 as compared to 99.0% in 2004, with the increase principally resulting from
elevated catastrophe losses, partially offset by improved prior year development.

Investment
Results.

Net investment income increased 5.4% to $522.8 million in 2005
from $495.9 million in 2004, reflecting growth in invested assets tempered by lower
investment yields and lower returns from limited partnership investments. Investable
assets increased by $1.4 billion to $13.0 billion in 2005, principally reflecting the
effects of investing $1,070.6 million cash flow from operations during the year and $758.2
million net proceeds from issuance of common shares, partially offset by $250.0 million in
debt repayment. The lower investment yield reflects the Company’s elevated short-term
investments following its common share capital raising in the fourth quarter, which also
reduced the investment income portfolio duration. Investment income for the limited
partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $11.5 million and $41.8
million, respectively.

The Company, because of its historical
income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of income yield
and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a measure of
performance than its overall income yield. However, in 2005, with changes the Company
perceived in overall investment market conditions, the Company continued to reweight its
view of total return and added $350.4 million in 2005 of equity securities into the
overall investment portfolio. The Company also added $125.2 million of other invested
assets, principally limited partnerships. The following table provides a comparison of the

The Company’s net realized
capital gains were $90.3 million in 2005, which reflected realized capital gains on the
Company’s investments of $106.2 million, including $41.3 million on the sale of
interest only strips investments, partially offset by $15.9 million of realized capital
losses, which included $7.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest
only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with EITF
99-20. Net realized capital gains were $89.6 million in 2004, which reflected realized
capital gains on the Company’s investments of $164.3 million, including $118.2
million on the sale of interest only strip investments, partially offset by $74.7 million
of realized capital losses, which included $65.0 million related to the write-downs in the
value of interest only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in
accordance with EITF 99-20.

The Company has issued seven equity
put options in its product portfolio at December 31, 2005, which were outstanding. These
products meet the definition of a derivative under Financial Accounting Standards No. 133.
The Company recognized net derivative expense of $2.6 million and $2.7 million in 2005 and
2004,


respectively, reflecting changes in fair value for the equity put options. See also
Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Corporate, Non-allocated
Expenses.

Corporate underwriting expenses not allocated to segments were
$18.4 million for 2005 as compared to $9.8 million for 2004 as the Company expanded its
infrastructure to support operations.

Interest, fees and bond issue cost
amortization expense in 2005 and 2004 were $74.4 million and $76.6 million, respectively.
Interest, fees and bond issue cost amortization expense in 2005 included $35.5 million
related to the senior notes, $37.5 million related to the junior subordinated debt
securities, $1.0 million related to the bond issue cost amortization and $0.4 million
related to the credit line under the Company’s revolving credit facilities. Interest,
fees and bond issue cost amortization expense in 2004 included $41.9 million related to
the senior notes, $32.4 million related to the junior subordinated debt securities, $1.1
million related to the bond issue cost amortization and $1.2 million related to the credit
line under the Company’s revolving credit facilities. The lower interest expense on
the senior notes was due to the retirement of the 8.5% senior notes due March 15, 2005,
partially offset by the issuance of new 5.4% senior notes on October 12, 2004.

Other expense in 2005 was $11.1
million compared to other income of $9.6 million in 2004. The change in net other expense
for 2005 from net other income in 2004 was primarily due to variability in the impact of
foreign exchange.

Income Taxes.

The Company’s income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates
and corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with
the impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations generally reflect changes in
the relative levels of pre-tax income between jurisdictions with different tax rates, and
specifically for 2005, also reflected the significant increase in incurred losses relating
to catastrophes resulting, ultimately, in a pre-tax loss for the year. The Company
recognized income tax benefits of $62.3 million in 2005 compared to income tax expense of
$64.9 million in 2004

.

The 2004 tax expense was impacted by various issues,
including the transfer of the Company’s UK branch to Bermuda Re, giving rise to a net
tax expense.

Net (Loss)
Income.

Net loss was $218.7 million in 2005 compared to net income of
$494.9 million in 2004, with the change primarily reflecting reduced underwriting
profitability due to catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior period
reserve development, related tax benefits and improved investment income.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

The following is a summary of the
critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that (1) require management
to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the
consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions.

LOSS AND LAE RESERVES.

The
Company’s most critical accounting policy is the determination of its loss and LAE
reserves. The Company maintains reserves equal to its estimated ultimate liability for
losses and LAE with respect to reported and unreported claims relating to both its
insurance and reinsurance businesses. Because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate
losses and LAE by underwriting or accident year, management, uses a variety of statistical
and actuarial techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time and evaluates new
information as it becomes known and adjusts reserves whenever an adjustment appears
warranted. Management considers many factors when setting reserves, including: (1) the
Company’s exposure base, generally its projected ultimate premiums earned; (2) its
expected loss ratios by product and class categories as determined through extensive
interaction between its underwriters and actuaries; (3) actuarial methodologies which
analyze the Company’s loss reporting and payment experience, information from ceding
companies and historical trends, such as reserving patterns, loss payments and product
mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and liability; (5) economic conditions;
and (6) the uncertainties discussed below regarding reserve requirements


for asbestos and
environmental (A&E) claims. Based on these considerations, management believes that
adequate provision has been made for the Company’s insurance and reinsurance loss and
LAE reserves. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate, perhaps substantially,
from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change in estimated
ultimate loss projections is recorded. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Company notes that there
generally is more uncertainty in establishing loss reserves for reinsurance liabilities
than for insurance liabilities. At December 31, 2006 the Company had reinsurance reserves
of $6,720.7 million and insurance loss reserves of $2,119.4 million, of which $260.4
million and $320.5 million, respectively, were loss reserves for A&E liabilities. A
detailed discussion of additional considerations related to A&E exposures follows
later in this section.

The detailed data required to
evaluate ultimate losses for insurance business is accumulated from the Company’s
underwriting and claim systems. Reserving for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss
information received from ceding companies. Ceding companies report losses to the Company
in many forms dependent on the type of contract and the negotiated reporting requirements.
Generally, proportional/quota share contracts require the submission of a
monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss settlement activity for the
period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company. This information
is recorded into the Company’s records. For certain proportional contracts, there is
also an individual loss reporting clause, which requires a detailed loss report on claims
that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss. Excess of
loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with
precautionary notices generally sent when losses reach a significant percentage of the
attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury occur.
All individual loss reports and supporting claim information are managed by the
Company’s experienced claims staff. Based on its own evaluation of the claim, the
Company may choose to establish additional case reserves (ACRs) as a supplement above the
case reserves reported by the ceding company. To ensure ceding companies are submitting
required and accurate data, the Underwriting, Claim, Reinsurance Accounting and Internal
Audit departments of the Company perform various reviews of the ceding carriers,
particularly larger ceding companies.

Both reinsurance and insurance
reserves are categorized into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis. The exposure
groupings are selected in such that the underlying exposures have reasonably homogeneous
loss development characteristics but are large enough to make the estimation of ultimate
losses credible. The selection of exposure groupings is reviewed periodically and may
change over time as the Company’s business changes. The Company currently uses over
200 exposure groupings to develop its reserve estimates. One of the key selection
characteristics for the exposure groupings is the length of time it historically takes to
report and settle claims. Claims that are reported and settled relatively quickly are
commonly referred to as short tail lines and principally derive from property coverages.
Casualty claims on the other hand tend to take longer to be reported and settled and are
generally referred to as long tail lines. Shorter tail lines are generally subject to less
volatility in the ultimate loss estimation and re-estimation process than longer tail
lines.

The same accepted actuarial
methodologies, such as Borhuetter-Ferguson, expected loss ratio and chain ladder reserving
methods, supplemented by judgment where appropriate, are used to develop an estimate of
ultimate losses and LAE for each exposure group. Although the same actuarial methodologies
are used for both short tail and long tail lines, the faster reporting of experience for
the short tail lines allows for earlier reliance on the estimates derived from the
reported loss experience based methods than is possible for the long tail lines, for
which, consequently, reliance must be placed on the exposure based estimates. For both
short and long tail lines, these general approaches are supplemented by judgment in
determining the ultimate losses and LAE for each exposure group. Projected losses from
widespread catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, generally cannot be estimated using
traditional actuarial models. The loss estimates for these types of events are
judgmentally established based on available information derived from the Company’s
quantitative and qualitative exposure analyses, reports and communications from ceding
companies and management’s


judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating
such losses, these estimates are subject to variability, the potential for which increases
with the severity and complexity of the underlying event.

There are no explicit provisions for
reserve uncertainty imbedded in the key actuarial assumptions or added to the actuarially
determined reserves. In situations where historical results have been volatile or the
class of business is new and immature, the Company actuaries’ ultimate reserve
selections may implicitly include a provision for uncertainty, but this is not significant
in relation to the entire reserve balance and is not separately captured on a quantitative
basis.

The amount of carried reserves at the
end of each reporting period is the amount of projected ultimate losses and LAE, reduced
by the cumulative amount paid. Similarly, IBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case
reserves and ACRs from total loss reserves. Detailed reserve studies for each exposure
group are completed once a year for reinsurance and quarterly for insurance. The completed
annual reinsurance reserve studies are rolled forward for each accounting period until the
subsequent reserve study is completed. The roll forward analysis includes a comparison of
actual reported losses to actuarially expected losses. Any significant variance between
actual and expected losses is investigated and appropriate adjustments recorded. For the
years presented, there were no significant changes in the key actuarial methodologies and
procedures used to project ultimate losses and therefore, loss reserve changes principally
result from changes in managements’ estimates of ultimate losses from amounts
reported in prior periods.

Given the inherent variability in
loss reserves, the Company has developed an estimated range of possible gross reserve
levels. This table of ranges by segment, accompanied by commentary on potential and
historical variability, is included in Financial Condition under Loss and LAE Reserves.
The ranges are statistically developed using the same exposure groups used in the reserve
setting process and aggregated to the segment level. The starting point for developing the
ranges is the reported reserves, which reflect the Company’s best estimate of
ultimate unpaid losses. For each exposure group, the Company calculates a range for each
year reflecting actuarial judgment for two variables. The first is the historical pattern
of ratios of IBNR to premiums earned at the level of the underlying business’s
maturity relative to its ultimate expected outcome. The second is the uncertainty
associated with the underlying business’s position within its underwriting cycle. The
ranges by year are then aggregated to develop a range for the exposure group taking into
account correlations that exist. The exposure groups are then aggregated to segment, again
accounting for existing correlations. The Company notes that its presentation of this
information is not directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as
there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such
presentations. The Company further notes that its recorded reserves reflect the
Company’s best point estimate of its liabilities and that its actuarial methodologies
focus on such point estimates around which ranges are subsequently developed.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
EXPOSURES.

The Company continues to receive claims under expired contracts, both
insurance and reinsurance, asserting alleged injuries and/or damages relating to or
resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos. The
Company’s environmental claims typically involve potential liability for (a) the
mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property
damages caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water. The
Company’s asbestos claims typically involve potential liability for bodily injury
from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products
containing asbestos.

The Company’s reserves include
an estimate of the Company’s ultimate liability for A&E claims. This estimate is
made based on judgmental assessment of the underlying exposures as the result of: (1) long
and variable reporting delays, both from insureds to insurance companies and from ceding
companies to reinsurers; (2) historical data, which is more limited and variable on
A&E losses than historical information on other types of casualty claims; and (3)
unique aspects of A&E exposures for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using
traditional reserving techniques. There are significant uncertainties in estimating the
amount of the Company’s


potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties
are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily
injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or
environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or
liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and
judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental
claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions
concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g)
uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or
environmental exposure.

With respect to asbestos claims in
particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound
the difficulty in estimating the Company’s liability. These developments include: (a)
the significant growth over a short period of time in the number of claims filed, in part
reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar and including claims against defendants
who may only have a “peripheral” connection to asbestos; (b) a disproportionate
percentage of claims filed by individuals with no functional injury, which should have
little to no financial value but that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts
and settlements; (c) the growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy filings by
companies as a result of asbestos claims (including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in
which companies attempt to resolve their asbestos liabilities in a manner that is
prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers from participating in the negotiation of
asbestos related bankruptcy reorganization plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a
small number of states that favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims that
might impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product
liability portion; (f) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst
procedural abuses; (g) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants,
especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some states to
address asbestos litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or the U.S.
Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
new claims filing rates have decreased, that new filings of asbestos-driven bankruptcies
have decreased and that various procedural and legislative reforms are beginning to
diminish the potential ultimate liability for asbestos losses.

Management believes that these
uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for A&E and particularly
asbestos losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves
for other types of losses. Given these uncertainties, management believes that no
meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established. The Company establishes
reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law
reflect an exposure for the Company or its ceding companies. The Company’s A&E
liabilities stem from Mt. McKinley’s direct insurance business and Everest Re’s
assumed reinsurance business.

In connection with the acquisition of
Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, LM provided reinsurance to
Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the first $200.0 million of any adverse
development of Mt. McKinley’s reserves as of September 19, 2000 and The Prudential
guaranteed LM’s obligations to Mt. McKinley. Cessions under this reinsurance
agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at December 31, 2003.

Due to the uncertainties discussed
above, the ultimate losses attributable to A&E, and particularly asbestos, may be
subject to more variability than are non-A&E reserves and such variation could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
and/or cash flows. See also Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

With respect to Mt. McKinley, where
the Company has a direct relationship with policyholders, the Company’s aggressive
litigation posture and the uncertainties inherent in the asbestos coverage and bankruptcy
litigation have provided an opportunity to actively engage in settlement negotiations with
a number of those policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities.
Those discussions are oriented towards achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that
limit Mt. McKinley’s liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. Because of
uncertainties and risks inherent in litigation, the Company cannot be certain that in
every instance


this approach will lead to negotiated settlements in the range expected by
the Company. Between 2004 and 2006, the Company concluded such settlements or reached
agreement in principle with 14 of its high profile policyholders. The Company currently
has identified 8 policyholders based on their past claim activity and/or potential future
liabilities as “High Profile Policyholders” and its settlement efforts are
generally directed at such policyholders, in part because their exposures have developed
to the point where both the policyholder and the Company have sufficient information to be
motivated to settle. The Company believes that this active approach will ultimately result
in a more cost-effective liquidation of Mt. McKinley’s liabilities than a passive
approach, although it may also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley’s
losses and cash flows as reserves are adjusted to reflect the developments in litigation,
negotiations and, ultimately, potential settlements.

There is less potential for similar
settlements with respect to the Company’s reinsurance asbestos claims. Ceding
companies, with their direct obligation to insureds and overall responsibility for claim
settlements, are not consistently aggressive in developing claim settlement information
and conveying this information to reinsurers, which can introduce significant and perhaps
inappropriate delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers. These
delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but also restrict the
information available to estimate the reinsurers’ ultimate exposure. See the
discussion below under the heading “Financial Condition – Loss and LAE
Reserves”.

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

The
Company purchases reinsurance to reduce its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss
occurrences. These agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses
and loss expenses under certain circumstances without relieving the insurer of its
obligation to the policyholder. In the event reinsurers were unable to meet their
obligations under these agreements or were able to successfully challenge losses ceded by
the Company under the contracts, the Company would not be able to realize the full value
of the reinsurance recoverable balance. In some cases, the Company may hold partial
collateral for the receivable, including letters of credit, trust assets and cash.
Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the U.S. are
generally required to secure their obligations. The Company establishes reserves for
uncollectible balances based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of the
outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the reserve for uncollectible
balances was $87.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively. To minimize exposure from
uncollectible reinsurance receivables, the Company has a reinsurance credit security
committee that generally evaluates the financial strength of a reinsurer prior to entering
into a reinsurance arrangement. Management believes that adequate provision has been made
for the Company’s uncollectible balances. Actual uncollectible amounts may vary,
perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the
change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements and “Financial Condition – Reinsurance Receivables” below.

PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED.

Premiums written by the Company are earned ratably over the coverage periods of the
related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned premium reserves are
established to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period. Such reserves are
established based upon reports received from ceding companies or computed using pro rata
methods based on statistical data. Premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not
yet been reported to the Company, are estimated and accrued. Because of the inherent lag
in the reporting of written and earned premiums by the Company’s ceding companies,
standard accepted actuarial methodologies are used to estimate earned but not reported
premium at each financial reporting date. These earned but not reported premiums are
combined with reported earned premiums to comprise the exposure base for determining the
Company’s incurred losses and loss and LAE reserves. Commission expense and incurred
losses related to the change in earned but not reported premium are included in current
period company and segment financial results. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

INVESTMENT VALUATION.

The
Company’s investment portfolio consists of fixed income investments classified for
accounting purposes as available for sale and equity securities. Accordingly, these
securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis. Most securities are traded on
national exchanges where market values are readily available. The Company holds some
privately placed securities, less than 0.5% of the portfolio, that are either valued by an
investment advisor or by the Company using cash flow projections. At December 31, 2006,
the Company’s investment portfolio included $442.5 million of limited partnership
investments whose value are reported pursuant to the equity method of accounting, which
management believes approximates market value. In 2005, the Company owned interest only
strips that were accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20, which sets forth the rules
for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value due to
impairment. Unrealized gains and losses from market fluctuations are reflected as
comprehensive income, while market value declines that are considered other than temporary
impairments are reflected in the income statement as realized capital losses. As of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had unrealized gains net of tax of $302.9 million
and $214.6 million, respectively. The Company considers many factors when determining
whether a market value decline is other than temporary, including: (1) the length of time
the market value has been below book value, (2) the credit strength of the issuer, (3) the
issuer’s market sector, (4) the length of time to maturity and (5) for asset backed
securities, increases in prepayments. If management assessments change in the future, the
Company may ultimately record a realized loss after management originally concluded that
the decline in value was temporary. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH AND INVESTED ASSETS.

Aggregate invested assets, including cash and short-term investments, were $13,957.1
million at December 31, 2006 and $12,970.8 million at December 31, 2005. This increase in
cash and invested assets resulted primarily from $636.3 million in cash flows from
operations, $176.4 million of foreign currency translation gains, $35.1 million of net
realized capital gains and a $131.7 million increase in net pre-tax unrealized
appreciation of the Company’s investments comprised of a $191.9 million increase in
pre-tax unrealized appreciation on the equity securities portfolio, partially offset by a
$60.2 million decrease in pre-tax unrealized appreciation in fixed maturities portfolio.
Cumulative gross pre-tax unrealized appreciation and depreciation across the
Company’s investment portfolio were $594.5 million and $122.8 million, respectively,
at December 31, 2006 compared to $443.1 million and $103.1 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2005.

The Company’s principal
investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and
reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a
high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, the Company
views its investment portfolio as having two components; 1) the investments needed to
satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by the Company’s
shareholders’ equity.


For outstanding liabilities, the
Company invests in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average
credit quality of Aa, as rated by the independent investment rating service of
Moody’s. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is
adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company’s current and projected operating
results, market conditions and the Company’s tax position. This fixed maturity
portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using
portfolio guidelines approved by the Company.

Over the past few years, the Company
has reallocated its shareholders’ equity investment portfolio to include 1) publicly
traded equity securities, primarily exchange traded funds, and 2) private equity limited
partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the
risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of
the portfolio to higher return asset classes. The Company has limited its allocation to
these asset classes because 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the
impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. At
December 31, 2006, the market value of investments in equity and limited partnership
securities approximated 40% of shareholders’ equity.

During 2005 and 2004, the Company
invested in interest only strips. These investments were intended to mitigate potential
decreases in unrealized appreciation on the Company’s fixed income portfolio during a
period when management believed there was high potential for increased general interest
rates. These securities give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated
coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments on the outstanding
mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash flow from
these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the mortgage pool.
Generally, as mortgage rates decline, mortgagors tend to pre-pay their mortgage loans
which decreases the average life of a mortgage pool and reduces expected cash flows.
Conversely, as mortgage rates rise, prepayments are more likely to slow and ultimate cash
flows tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to increase
as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These movements
are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the Company’s other
fixed income investments. Although the Company invested in interest only strips during
2005 and 2004, the Company had liquidated its positions in interest only strips and held
no such securities at or after December 31, 2005.

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

Reinsurance receivables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled $772.8 million at
December 31, 2006, $1,048.7 million at December 31, 2005, and $1,210.8 million at December
31, 2004. At December 31, 2006, $169.4 million, or 21.9%, was receivable from
Transatlantic, $100.9 million, or 13.1%, was receivable from LM, whose obligations are
guaranteed by The Prudential, $100.2 million, or 13.0%, was receivable from Founders,
$100.0 million, or 12.9%, was receivable from Continental, which is partially collaterized
by funds held arrangements, $52.5 million, or 6.8%, was receivable from subsidiaries of
London Life, which is fully collateralized by letters of credit, and $42.7 million, or
5.5%, was receivable from Munich Re. Continental is collateralized by a funds held
arrangements under which the Company has retained the premium payments due the
retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced such liabilities as
payments are due from the retrocessionaire. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more
than 5% of the Company’s receivables.

LOSS AND LAE RESERVES.

Gross
loss and LAE reserves totaled $8,840.1 million at December 31, 2006, $9,126.7 million at
December 31, 2005 and $7,836.3 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease in 2006 was
primarily attributable to the payout in 2006 of catastrophe loss reserves held at December
31, 2005, partially offset by unfavorable net prior period reserve strengthening. The
increases in 2005 and 2004 were primarily attributable to increased catastrophe losses,
partially offset by favorable net prior period reserve adjustments and reduced premiums
earned.

The following tables summarize gross
outstanding loss and LAE reserves by segment, segregated into case reserves and IBNR
reserves, which are managed on a combined basis, for the years indicated:

The changes by segment generally
reflect changes in earned premium, changes in business mix, the impact of reserve
re-estimations and changes in catastrophe loss reserves, together with claim settlement
activity. The fluctuations for A&E reflect the impact of reserve re-evaluations and
claim settlement activity.

The Company’s loss and LAE
reserves are an estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid claims. Such estimates are
re-evaluated on an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking
into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and
claim experience. Such re-evaluations impact incurred losses in the period when the
re-evaluation is made. The Company notes that its analytical methods and processes operate
at multiple levels including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes
and lines of business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the
aggregate. The complexities of the Company’s business and operations require analyses
and adjustments, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. Additionally,
the attribution of reserves, change in reserves and incurred losses between accident year
and underwriting year requires adjustments and allocations, both qualitative and
quantitative, at these various levels. All of these processes, methods and practices
appropriately balance actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a
manner intended to assure the accuracy, precision and consistency of the Company’s
reserving practices, which are fundamental to the Company’s operation. The Company
notes however, that the underlying reserves are estimates, which are subject to variation.

There can be no assurance that
reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future, possibly
by a material amount. However, management believes that the Company’s existing
reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows. In this context, the Company notes that over the past 10 years,
its past calendar year operations have been affected variably by effects from prior period
reserve re-estimates, with such effects ranging from a favorable $62.1 million in 1997,
representing 2.2% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment
was made, to an unfavorable $249.4 million in 2004, representing 3.7% of the net prior
period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made. The


Company has noted that
variability had increased for years 1999 to 2003 and has taken actions to attempt to
reduce year to year variability prospectively.

The Company has included ranges for
loss reserve estimates determined by the Company’s actuaries, which are derived
through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. The Company notes that its
presentation of this information is not directly comparable to similar presentations of
other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards
governing such presentations. The Company further notes that its recorded reserves reflect
the Company’s best point estimate of its liabilities. The Company’s actuarial
methodologies develop point estimates and the ranges are developed subsequently.

The following table below represents
the reserve levels and ranges as of December 31, 2006 for each of the Company’s
business segments.

(1)
               There can be no assurance that reserves will not ultimately exceed the indicated
               ranges, requiring additional income statement expense.

(2)
               Although totals are displayed for both the low range and high range amounts, it
               should be noted that statistically the range of the total is not equal to the
               sum of the ranges of the segments.

(3)
               Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management
               is unable to establish a range for these obligations. As a result, these
               reserves which relate principally to the U.S. Reinsurance and Bermuda segments,
               have been segregated from reserves for which a range has been determined.

(4)
               NA means not applicable

Depending on the specific segment,
the range derived for the loss reserves, excluding reserves for A&E exposures, ranges
from minus 8.8% to minus 14.8% for the low range and from plus 8.8% to plus 14.8% for the
high range. Both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the U.S. Insurance
segment. The Company notes that the width of the range is dependent on the level of
confidence associated with the outcome. Within each range, management’s best estimate
of loss reserves is based on the point estimate

derived by the Company’s
actuaries in detailed reserve studies. Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the
lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development. For the
above presentation, management has assumed what it believes is a reasonable confidence
level but notes that there can be no assurance that the Company’s claim obligations
will not vary within and potentially outside of these ranges, requiring incurred loss
adjustments in the period the variability is recognized. The Company is not able to
establish a meaningful range for A&E reserves.

Additional losses, including those
relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type
or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the Company or the reinsurance and insurance
industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not
covered by existing retrocessional


contracts, could have material adverse effects on the
Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Company has exposure to A&E
losses through its Mt. McKinley operation with respect to insurance policies and through
Everest Re with respect to reinsurance contracts. In each case, the Company’s
management and analyses of its exposures take into account a number of features of its
business that differentiate the Company’s exposures from many other insurers and
reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures.

Mt.
          McKinley began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and
          increased the volume of its writings in 1977. These writings ceased in 1984,
          giving Mt. McKinley an approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure,
          which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with
          significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and
          standardization of policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s
          to have been issued without aggregate limits on the product liability coverage;
          policies issued in earlier decades were generally more likely to lack aggregate
          limits.

The vast majority of Mt.
McKinley’s A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies, with
aggregate coverage limits, which by definition also have protection afforded by underlying
coverage. Mt. McKinley’s attachment points vary but generally are excess of millions,
often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying coverage. The excess nature of most of
Mt. McKinley’s policies also offers insulation against “non-product” claims
(for example, claims arising under general liability coverage). Although under some
circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non-product claims, such claims
generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non-product claims are generally
less likely to aggregate. In addition, environmental claims arise under general liability
coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these claims tend to create exposure for
primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies.

Virtually all of the Mt. McKinley
policies that are still potentially exposed to claims have policy language providing that
expenses are covered only within limits rather than in addition to limits. This is a
substantial difference from primary coverage, which would most often cover expenses in
addition to limits.

Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was
not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under which A&E exposures
generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E exposures through
contract exclusions effected in 1984. Therefore, Everest Re has an approximate 11-year
window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many reinsurance companies that have
significant A&E exposures. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re was not
as heavily involved in casualty business as in property business, which generally is not
exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re generally took smaller lines of exposure per
contract than many other reinsurers operating in the casualty reinsurance market and those
lines were generally also smaller than the excess limits provided by Mt. McKinley
policies. This means that the potential adverse development on Everest Re’s
reinsurance business is likely to be smaller than companies having greater exposures per
risk. Everest Re reinsured both primary and excess policies. However, its claim experience
to date indicates that the majority of its reinsurance was on excess policies. As a
result, most of Everest Re’s exposure derives from excess policies similar to those
written by Mt. McKinley.

With respect to both the Mt. McKinley
and Everest Re operations, the Company was not a member of the Asbestos Claims Facility
(“Wellington”) or the Center for Claims Resolution (“CCR”) claim
settlement facilities. Insurers supporting those facilities made broad commitments
concerning the application of insurance coverage to asbestos claims. With respect to its
direct insurance exposures, the fact that the Company has not made those commitments may
allow it to resolve insurance exposure to Wellington/CCR insureds more economically than
if it had joined these facilities. With respect to its reinsurance exposures, although the
Company was not a signatory to the Wellington or CCR facilities, it issued reinsurance
contracts to ceding companies that were signatories. Because the insurers supporting these
facilities have generally paid their


exposures more quickly than non-signatory insurers,
the Company believes that this has generally meant that it has paid its reinsurance
exposure more quickly than it likely would have if it had not been subject to
Wellington/CCR payments.

The Company believes that its A&E
exposures are unique and differentiated, by the points noted above, from those insurers
and reinsurers with appreciable A&E exposure but there can be no assurance that such
factors will protect the Company from adverse development, perhaps material, or allow it
to secure advantages in the settlement of its claims obligations.

The following table summarizes
incurred losses with respect to A&E on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for
the years indicated:

At December 31, 2006, the gross
reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $135.6 million representing case reserves
reported by ceding companies, $152.1 million representing additional case reserves
established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $213.7 million representing case
reserves established by the Company on direct excess insurance claims, including Mt.
McKinley, and $148.7 million representing IBNR reserves.

The Company incurred adverse
development for A&E exposures of $113.4 million and $77.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These increases are the result of re-evaluations
by management of additional information received from insureds and ceding companies,
ongoing litigation, additional claims received and settlement activity. Management closely
monitors this additional information and adjusts reserves accordingly.

Industry analysts have developed a
measurement, known as the survival ratio, to compare the A&E reserves among companies
with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a
company’s current net reserves by the three year average of paid losses. Hence, the
survival ratio equals the number of


years that it would take to exhaust the current
reserves based on historical payment levels. Using this measurement, the Company’s
net three year A&E survival ratio was 4.1 years at December 31, 2006. Adjusting for
the effect of the reinsurance ceded under the reinsurance agreement with LM, this ratio
rises to the equivalent of 5.0 years at December 31, 2006. The cession of $100.9 million
to the stop loss reinsurance provided by LM in connection with the acquisition of Mt.
McKinley results in unpaid proceeds that are not reflected in past net payments and
effectively extends the funding available for future net payments.

Because the survival ratio was
developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and not of absolute reserve
adequacy, the Company considers, but does not rely on, the survival ratio when evaluating
its reserves. In particular, the Company notes that year to year loss payment variability
can be material. This is due in part, to the Company’s orientation to negotiated
settlements, particularly on its Mt. McKinley exposures, which significantly impairs the
credibility and utility of this measure as an analytical tool. During 2006, the Company
made asbestos net claim payments of $16.6 million to Mt McKinley high profile claimants
where the claim was either closed or a settlement was reached. Such payments, which are
non-repetitive, distort the Company’s three year survival ratio for 2006 and will
continue to do so for 2007 and 2008. Adjusting for such settlements, recognizing total
settlements are generally considered fully reserved to an agreed settlement, the Company
considers that its adjusted A&E survival ratio for net unsettled claims is 7.7 years,
which is closer to prevailing industry norms.

Developments in 2006 and 2005
affecting asbestos exposures in general and the Company’s asbestos exposures in
particular, together with enhancements in the Company’s claim management and
analytical processes, resulted in the reserve strengthening noted earlier. These
developments and actions have increased the emphasis on asbestos exposures as a separate
component of the Company’s A&E exposures. Despite the Company’s approach of
handling A&E exposures on a combined basis, management believes additional disclosure
of the asbestos element of its A&E exposures is appropriate.

The following tables summarize
reserve and claim activity for asbestos claims, gross and net of ceded reinsurance, for
the periods indicated with particular emphasis on the differentiation of insured
categories within the Mt. McKinley operation, which the Company believes reflects the most
volatile element of its asbestos exposures for the years ended December 31:




The Company’s net three year
survival ratio on its asbestos exposures only was 4.0 years for the period ended December
31, 2006. This three year survival ratio, when adjusted for the effect of the reinsurance
ceded under the stop loss cover from LM, was 4.9 years and, when adjusted for settlements
in place and structured settlements, which are either fully funded by reserves or subject
to financial terms that substantially limit the potential variability in the liability,
and the stop loss protection from LM, was 7.7 years.

Company’s shareholders’ equity increased to $5,107.7 million as of December 31,
2006 from $4,139.7 million as of December 31, 2005, principally reflecting $840.8 million
of net income for 2006, a $54.1 million increase due to net currency translation, a $38.6
million increase in net share-based compensation activity and a $88.3 million increase in
net unrealized appreciation on investments, partially offset by $39.0 million of
shareholder dividends and an increase of $15.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive
income due to FAS 158 for pensions. The Company’s shareholders’ equity increased
to $4,139.7 million as of December 31, 2005 from $3,712.5 million as of December 31, 2004,
principally reflecting $758.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares,
partially offset by $218.7 million of net loss for 2005, a $27.0 million decrease in net
currency translation, a $77.8 million decrease in net unrealized appreciation on
investments, $25.4 million shareholder dividends and an increase of $2.9 million in the
minimum pension liability.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

CAPITAL.

The Company’s business operations are in part dependent on the
          Company’s financial strength, and the market’s perception thereof, as
          measured by shareholders’ equity, which was $5,107.7 million and $4,139.7
          million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company possesses
          significant financial flexibility and access to the debt and equity markets as a
          result of its perceived financial strength, as evidenced by the financial
          strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies. The Company
          continuously monitors its capital and financial position, as well as investment
          and security market conditions and responds accordingly.

From time to time, the Company has
used open market share repurchases to effectively adjust its capital position. In
September 2004, the Company’s authorization to purchase its shares was amended to
authorize the repurchase of up to 5 million shares. It made no such purchases in 2006 or
in 2005. The Company notes that, outside of its open market repurchase program, it
repurchased 21,384 shares in 2006 and 10,430 shares in 2005 from employees in connection
with restricted share vestings where individual employees chose to discharge withholding
tax liabilities on vesting shares by the surrender of a portion of such shares. In 2005,
328 shares were surrendered from a non-employee in connection with payment of the option
exercise price. At December 31, 2006, there remained 5 million shares under the repurchase
authorization.

On December 1, 2005, the Company
filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, as a Well Known Seasoned
Issuer under the new registration and offering revisions to the Securities Act of 1933.
Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group is authorized to issue common
shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings is
authorized to issue debt securities and Everest Re Capital Trust III (“Capital Trust
III”) is authorized to issue trust preferred securities.

•

On December 1, 2005, the Company issued 2,298,000 of its common shares at a price of
$102.89 per share, which resulted in $236.4 million of proceeds before expenses and
Holdings sold Group shares it acquired in 2002 at a price of $102.89 per share, which
resulted in $46.5 million of proceeds before expenses. Expenses incurred for this
transaction were approximately $0.3 million.

On June 27, 2003, the Company filed a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance of up to
$975.0 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group
was authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and
hybrid securities, Holdings was authorized to issue debt securities and Capital Trust II
and Capital Trust III were authorized to issue trust preferred securities. This shelf
registration statement became effective on December 22, 2003 and was


exhausted with the
October 6, 2005 transaction described below. The following securities were issued issued
pursuant to that registration statement.

•

On March 29, 2004, Capital Trust II, an unconsolidated affiliate, issued trust preferred
securities resulting in a takedown from the shelf registration statement of $320.0
million. In conjunction with the issuance of Capital Trust II’s trust preferred
securities, Holdings issued $329.9 million of 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities
due March 29, 2034 to Capital Trust II. Part of the proceeds from the issuance of the
junior subordinated debt securities was used for capital contributions to Holdings’
operating subsidiaries.

•

On October 12, 2004, Holdings completed a public offering of $250.0 million principal
amount of 5.40% senior notes due October 15, 2014. The net proceeds were used to retire
existing debt at Holdings, which was due and retired on March 15, 2005.

•

On October 6, 2005, the Company expanded the size of the remaining shelf registration to
$486.0 million by filing under Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
General Instruction IV of Form S-3 promulgated there under. On the same date, the Company
entered into an agreement to issue 5,200,000 of its common shares at a price of $91.50 per
share, which resulted in $475.8 million in proceeds received on October 12, 2005, before
expenses of approximately $0.3 million. This transaction effectively exhausted the
December 22, 2003 shelf registration.

On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed
a public offering of $200.0 million principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15,
2010 and $250.0 million principal amount of 8.50% senior notes due and retired March 15,
2005. During 2000, the net proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were
distributed by Holdings to Group.

LIQUIDITY.

The Company’s principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are
          available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize
          after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified
          investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, the Company views its
          investment portfolio as having two components; 1) the investments needed to
          satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by the Company’s
          shareholders’ equity.

For outstanding liabilities, the
Company invests in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average
credit quality of Aa, as rated by the independent investment rating service of
Moody’s. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is
adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company’s current and projected operating
results, market conditions and the Company’s tax position. This fixed maturity
portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using
portfolio guidelines approved by the Company.

Over the past few years, the Company
has reallocated its shareholders’ equity investment portfolio to include 1) publicly
traded equity securities, primarily exchange traded funds, and 2) private equity limited
partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the
risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of
the portfolio to higher return asset classes. The Company has limited its allocation to
these asset classes because 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the
impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. At
December 31, 2006, the market value of investments in equity and limited partnership
securities approximated 40% of shareholders’ equity.

The Company’s liquidity
requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow
results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for
claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the
collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally
invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and


investment income provides
additional funding for loss payments. The Company’s net cash flows from operating
activities were $636.3 million, $1,070.6 million and $1,490.9 million

for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additionally, these cash flows
reflected net tax payments of $46.6 million, $110.9 million and $100.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively; net catastrophe loss payments
of $896.5 million, $459.7 million and $200.9 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively; and net A&E settlements of $45.5 million, $137.7
million and $187.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The decrease in net cash flows from operations in 2006 compared with 2005
was primarily due to higher claim payments on catastrophes. The decrease in net cash flows
from operations in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to higher claim payments on
catastrophes combined with lower premium volume.

If disbursements for claims and
benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses exceed premium inflows,
cash flow from insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash flow from
operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally,
cash flow from investment maturities and dispositions, both short term investments and
longer term maturities, would further mitigate the impact on total cash flow.

As the timing of payments for claims
and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains portfolios of long
term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that
provide additional liquidity for payment of claims. At December 31, 2006 and December 31,
2005 the Company held cash and short-term investments of $1,556.4 million and $1,551.0
million, respectively. In addition to these cash and short-term investments at December
31, 2006, the Company had $0.6 billion, at fair value, of available for sale fixed
maturity securities maturing within one year or less, $2.5 billion maturing within one to
five years and $7.2 billion maturing after five years. The Company’s $1.6 billion of
equity securities are comprised primarily of publicly traded securities that can be easily
liquidated. These fixed maturity and equity securities, in conjunction with the short-term
investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide adequate sources of liquidity
for the expected payment of losses in the near future. The Company does not anticipate
selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but has the
ability to do so. Sales of securities might result in realized capital gains or losses and
the Company notes that at December 31, 2006 it had $471.7 million of net pre-tax
unrealized appreciation, comprised of $594.5 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation
and $122.8 million of pre-tax unrealized depreciation.

Management expects the trend of
positive cash flow from operations, which in general reflects the strength of overall
pricing, to persist over the near term; however, cashflow from operations will continue to
be negatively impacted by the payout of catastrophe loss reserves. In the intermediate and
long term, the trend will be impacted by the extent to which competitive pressures affect
overall pricing in the Company’s markets and the extent to which the Company
successfully maintains its strategy of emphasizing underwriting profitability.

Effective December 8, 2004, Group,
Bermuda Re, and Everest International entered into a three year, $750.0 million senior
credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Group Credit Facility”).
Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility. The Group Credit
Facility consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $250.0 million of revolving
credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of standby
letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the option of each of the
borrowers, be either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of
the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or
the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the
fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depend on Group’s senior unsecured debt
rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500.0 million for the issuance of
collateralized standby letters of credit.

The Group Credit Facility requires
Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a
minimum net worth. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of (i) $2,898.0 million
(base


amount) plus (ii) (A) 25% of consolidated net income for each of Group’s fiscal
quarters and (B) 50% of any increase in consolidated net worth attributable to the
issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. The base amount is reset at the end of each
fiscal year to be the greater of 70% of Group’s consolidated net worth as of the last
day of the fiscal year and the calculated minimum amount of net worth prior to the last
day of the fiscal year. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with these
covenants.

During the year ended December 31,
2006, there were no outstanding borrowings under tranche one of the Group Credit Facility.
As of December 31, 2006, $185.4 million of the $500.0 million available for tranche two of
standby letters of credit was used. In addition, the Company had $274.6 million in letters
of credit outstanding at December 31, 2006 under a $350.0 million bilateral agreement with
Citibank. All of these letters of credit are collateralized by the Company’s cash and
investments. These letters of credit are generally used to collateralize reinsurance
assumed by Bermuda Re from jurisdictions where collateralization is generally required for
the ceding company to receive financial statement credit for such reinsurance recoverables
from its principal regulator. Bermuda Re and Everest International also used trust
arrangements to provide collateralization to ceding companies, including affiliates. The
Company generally avoids providing collateral except where required for ceding companies
to receive credit from their regulators. Additionally, at December 31, 2006, $135.7
million of assets were deposited in trust accounts, primarily on behalf of Bermuda Re, as
security for assumed losses payable to certain non-affiliated ceding companies.

Effective August 23, 2006, Holdings
entered into a new five year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of lenders, replacing the October 10, 2003 three year senior revolving credit
facility, which expired on October 10, 2006. Both the August 23, 2006 and October 10, 2003
senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the
“Holdings Credit Facility”. Citibank N.A. is the administrative agent for the
Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general
corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to
$150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base
Rate (as defined below) or (2) a periodic fixed rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus an
applicable margin. The Base Rate means a fluctuating interest rate per annum in effect
from time to time to be equal to the higher of (a) the rate of interest publicly announced
by Citibank as its prime rate or 0.5% per annum above the Federal Funds Rate, in each case
plus the applicable margin. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Holdings
Credit Facility depends upon Holdings’ senior unsecured debt rating.

The Holdings Credit Facility requires
Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and Everest Re
to maintain its statutory surplus at $1.5 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income
and 25% of future aggregate capital contributions after December 31, 2005. As of December
31, 2006, Holdings was in compliance with these covenants.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
there were no outstanding Holdings Credit Facility borrowings.

Interest expense and fees incurred in
connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings Credit Facility were $0.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Interest expense and fees incurred
in connection with the Holdings Credit Facility was $1.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES.

Like
other insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured
losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or
an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. A large
catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance
treaties, facultative certificates and across lines of business.

The Company focuses on potential
losses that could result from any single event, or series of events as part of its
evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly,
the Company employs


various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain
from any single catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These techniques range
from non-modeled deterministic approaches—such as tracking aggregate limits exposed
in catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic damage factors—to modeled approaches
that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation
techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic
basis.

No single universal model is currenty
capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions
in which the Company conducts business. In addition, the form, quality and granularity of
underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with
the data requirements for the Company’s licensed models, which adds to the inherent
imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the results from multiple models
and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by
and across business units. The combination of techniques potentially adds to the
imprecision of the Company’s estimates. Also, while most models have been updated in
2006 to better incorporate factors that contributed to unprecedented industry storm losses
in 2004 and 2005, such as flood, storm surge and demand surge, catastrophe model
projections are inherently imprecise. In addition, uncertainties with respect to future
climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss
projections from models using historic long-term frequency and severity data.

Nevertheless, when combined with
traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models
are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing
management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk
exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events.

Projected catastrophe losses are
generally summarized in terms of the PML. The Company defines PML as its anticipated loss,
taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a
broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake. The
PML will vary depending upon the severity of modeled simulated losses and the make-up of
the in force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of
“return periods”, such as “100-year events” and “250-year
events”. For example, a 100-year PML corresponds to the estimated loss from a single
event which has a 1% probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period. Conversely,
it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the
indicated PML. It is important to notes that PMLs are estimates. Modeled events are
hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model. As a result, there can be no assurance
that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from
events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML.

From a risk management perspective,
the Company endeavors to manage its catastrophe risk profile such that the projected economic loss
from its largest 100-year event does not exceed approximately $500 million. Economic loss
is viewed as the gross PML loss reduced by estimated reinstatement
premiums to renew coverage and income taxes. The impact of income taxes on the PML depends on the
distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate
reinsurance. Management also monitors its largest PMLs at multiple points along the loss
distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 year
return periods. This process enables management to identify exposure accumulations to
integrate into enterprise risk, underwriting and capital management processes.

The Company’s catastrophe loss
projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a
formal risk management review process.

The Company believes that its
greatest worldwide 1 in 100 year exposure to a single catastrophic event is to a hurricane
affecting the U.S. southeast coast where the Company estimates it has a gross PML
exposure of $777 million. See also table under “Risk Management and Retrocession
Arrangements”.


If such a single catastrophe loss
were to occur, management estimates that the economic loss to the Company would be
approximately $471 million. The impact represents approximately 9% of the Company’s
beginning of year capital. The estimate involves multiple variables, including which
Everest entity would experience the loss, and as a result there can be no assurance that
this amount would not be exceeded.

The Company may purchase reinsurance
to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of
exposures across some or all of the Company’s operations. Reinsurance purchasing
decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the
pricing, terms, conditions and availability of coverage, with the aim of securing cost
effective protection. The amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time, reflecting
the Company’s view of its exposures and the cost of reinsurance.

For 2004, 2005 and thus far in 2006,
the Company has not purchased corporate retrocessional protection and has generally
de-emphasized the purchase of specific reinsurance by its underwriters, reflecting the
Company’s view that its exposures, in the context of its capital, financial position
and current market pricing, do not warrant reinsurance purchases at current price levels.
For 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss
retrocession coverage, which provided up to $175.0 million of recoveries per accident year
if Everest Re’s consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss
ratio attachment point provided in the contract for the respective accident years. Each
arrangement provided for an adjustment premium, which reduced the net benefit by
approximately 50%, in the event that the coverage was used. The limit has been fully
utilized and there are no remaining limits available under these agreements. See ITEM 1,
“Business — Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements”
for further details.

               Loss and LAE reserves represent the Company’s best estimate of losses from
               claim and related settlement costs. Both the amounts and timing of such payments
               are estimates, and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as
               changes in market conditions make the timing of cash outflows uncertain.
               Therefore, the ultimate amount and timing of loss and LAE payments could differ
               from the Company’s estimates.

The contractual obligations for
senior notes and junior subordinated debt are the responsibility of Holdings. The Company
has sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to satisfy
these obligations, Holdings generally depends for its funding upon dividends from Everest
Re, its operating insurance subsidiary, capital contributions from Group or access to the
capital markets. The Company’s various operating insurance and reinsurance
subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle outstanding
reserves for losses and LAE. Management believes that the Company, and each of its
entities, have sufficient financial resources, or ready access thereto, to meet all
obligations.


DIVIDENDS

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company declared and paid shareholder dividends of $39.0 million, $25.4 million and $22.4
million, respectively. As an insurance holding company, the Company is partially dependent
on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to
its shareholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest
Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by
Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. Management expects
that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest
Re’s ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Holdings’
general corporate needs and that Holdings and Bermuda Re will have the ability to declare
and pay dividends sufficient to support Group’s general corporate needs. For the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Everest Re paid dividends to Holdings of
$100.0 million, $75.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively. For the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Bermuda Re paid dividends to Group of $60.0 million,
$45.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively. See ITEM 1, “Business –
Regulatory Matters – Dividends” and Note 14A of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

APPLICATION OF NEW
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement 123(R) “Share-Based
Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”), which is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company adopted FAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. FAS 123(R)
requires all share-based compensation awards, granted, modified or settled after December
15, 1994 to be accounted for using the fair value method of accounting. Under the modified
prospective application, compensation cost is recognized for the outstanding, non-vested
awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(“FAS 123”). The Company implemented FAS 123 prospectively for grants issued on
or after January 1, 2002. The adoption of FAS 123(R) resulted in $169,037 of additional
compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 for options granted prior to FAS
123.

In November 2005, the FASB issued
FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 115-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“FAS 115-1”), which
is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. FAS 115-1 addresses
the determination of when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is
other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. FAS 115-1 also includes
accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary
impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses not recognized as
other-than-temporary impairments. The Company adopted FAS 115-1 prospectively effective
January 1, 2006. The Company believes it has appropriately recorded realized losses for
all securities owned that have experienced an other-than-temporary impairment, and all
unrealized losses in its investment portfolio are temporary in nature.

In July 2006, the FASB released FASB
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“FAS
109”). FIN 48 prescribes the recognition and measurement criteria for the financial
statements for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Further, FIN
48 expands the required disclosures associated with uncertain tax positions. The Company
will adopt FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The Company does not believe the impact of
implementing FIN 48 will be material on its consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements”
(“FAS 157”), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. FAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value consistently in GAAP and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company will adopt FAS


157 on January 1,
2008. The Company does not believe the impact of implementing FAS 157 will be material on
its consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (“FAS 158”), which
is effective for employers with publicly traded equity securities as of the end of the
fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. FAS 158 requires an employer to (a) recognize
in its financial statements an asset for a plan’s over funded status or a liability
for a plan’s under funded status, (b) measure a plan’s assets and its
obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal
year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement
plan in the year in which the changes occur as other comprehensive income. The Company
adopted FAS 158 for the reporting period ended December 31, 2006. The impact on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006 was a $23.1 million
pre-tax, or $15.0 million after-tax, reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income.

MARKET SENSITIVE
INSTRUMENTS

The SEC’s Financial Reporting
Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial
statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative
commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, “market
sensitive instruments”). The Company does not generally enter into market sensitive
instruments for trading purposes.

The Company’s current investment
strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable
and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of
liquidity. The Company’s mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted
continuously, consistent with its current and projected operating results, market
conditions and the Company’s tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment
portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, the
Company invests in equity securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted
total return of the investment portfolio. The Company has also written a small number of
equity put options.

The overall investment strategy
considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular,
estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability
transactions, together with the Company’s capital structure and other factors, are
used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout
characteristics for which the investments of the Company provide liquidity. This analysis
is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation,
duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure
principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period.

Interest Rate Risk.

The
Company’s $14.0 billion investment portfolio at December 31, 2006 is principally
comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are generally subject to interest rate risk
and 17.1%, are subject to foreign currency rate risk, and equity securities, which are
subject to price fluctuations. The impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment
portfolio is generally mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency
denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact.

Interest rate risk is the potential
change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, from a
change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, it includes
prepayment risk on the $1,594.0 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $10,319.9
million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated
principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the
security.

The tables below display the
potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on the
Company’s fixed maturity portfolio (including $1.3 billion of short-term investments)
as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 based on upward and downward parallel and immediate 100
and 200 basis point shifts in interest


rates. For legal entities with a U.S. dollar
functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually. To
generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment
expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account. For legal
entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the
involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the
various interest rate change scenarios. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented
in millions.

The Company had $8,840.1 million and
$9,126.7 million of reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2006 and December 31,
2005. These amounts are recorded at their nominal value, as opposed to fair value, which
would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money. Since losses are
paid out over a period of time, the fair value of the reserves is less than the nominal
value. As interest rates rise, the fair value of the reserves decreases and, conversely,
as interest rates decline, the fair value increases. These movements are the opposite of
the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments. While the difference between
fair value and nominal value is not reflected in the Company’s financial statements,
the Company’s financial results will include investment income over time from the
investment portfolio until the claims are paid. The Company’s loss and loss reserve
obligations have an expected duration of approximately 3.8 years, which is reasonably
consistent with the Company’s fixed income portfolio. If the Company were to discount
its loss and LAE reserves, net of $0.8 billion of reinsurance receivables on unpaid
losses, the discount would be approximately $1.5 billion resulting in a discounted reserve
balance of approximately $6.5 billion, representing approximately 56% of the market value
of the fixed maturity investment portfolio funds.

Equity Risk.

Equity risk is
the potential change in market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios
arising from changing equity prices. The Company’s equity investments are mainly
exchange traded and mutual funds, which invest principally in high quality common and
preferred stocks that are traded on the major exchanges in the U.S. The primary objective
in managing the equity portfolio is to provide capital growth over time through market
appreciation and income.


The tables below display the impact
on market value and after-tax unrealized appreciation of a 10% and 20% change in equity
prices up and down as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The growth in exposure is primarily
due to the growth in the equity portfolio. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are
presented in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk.

Foreign
currency risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each of the Company’s non-U.S./Bermuda
(“foreign”) operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its
geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Generally, the Company
prefers to maintain the capital of its operations in U.S. dollar assets, although this
varies by regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation
may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in
which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are
the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. The Company mitigates
foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of its assets to
its corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”, the Company translates
the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities
to the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other
comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006 there has been no material change in
exposure to foreign exchange rates as compared to December 31, 2005.

The tables below display the
potential impact of a parallel and immediate 10% and 20% increase and decrease in foreign
exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure as
of December 31, 2006 and 2005. This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation
from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of
translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. All amounts
are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions.

Although not considered material in
the context of the Company’s aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments, the
Company has issued six equity put options based on the S&P 500 index and one equity
put


option based on the FTSE 100 index, that are market sensitive and sufficiently unique
to warrant supplemental disclosure.

The
Company has sold six equity put options based on the S&P 500 index for total
consideration, net of commissions, of $22.5 million. These contracts each have a single
exercise date, with original maturities ranging from 12 to 30 years and strike prices
ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No
amounts will be payable under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is at or above the
strike price on the exercise dates, which currently fall between June 2017 and March 2031.
If the S&P 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date,
the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below
the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31,
2006 index value, the Company estimates the probability for each contract of the S&P
500 index falling below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 4.4%. The
theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise
dates the S&P 500 index value were zero. The present value of these theoretical
maximum payouts using a 6.0% discount factor is $213.2 million.

The Company has sold one equity put
option based on the FTSE 100 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $6.7
million. This contract has an exercise date of July 2020 and a strike price of
£5,989.75. No amount will be payable under this contract if the FTSE 100 index is at
or above the strike price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index is lower than the
strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately
with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical
index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2006 index value, the Company estimates
the probability that FTSE 100 index contract will be below the strike price on the
exercise date to be less than 7.0%. The theoretical maximum payout under the contract
would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was zero. The present value
of the theoretical maximum payout using a 6.0% discount factor is $29.2 million.

Because the equity put options are
derivatives within the framework of FAS 133, the Company reports the fair value of these
instruments in its balance sheet and records any changes to fair value in its statement of
operations. The Company has recorded fair values for its obligations on these equity put
options at December 31, 2006 and 2005 of $37.5 million and $36.3 million, respectively;
however, the Company does not believe that the ultimate settlement of these transactions
is likely to require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received or any
payment at all.

As there is no active market for
these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted
option pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions, including those regarding
volatility and expected rates of return.


The tables below estimate the impact
of potential movements in interest rates and the equity indices, which are the principal
factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair value at
December 31, 2006 and 2005. These are estimates and there can be no assurance regarding
future market performance. The asymmetrical results of the interest rate and S&P 500
and FTSE 100 indices shift reflect that the liability cannot fall below zero whereas it
can increase to its theoretical maximum.

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial
reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


Management has assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

. Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of
December 31, 2006, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.

Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report in Part IV, Item
15, “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm”.

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the
Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, has evaluated our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether
any changes occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter covered by this annual report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change
during the fourth quarter.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Everest Re Group, Ltd.:

We have completed integrated audits
of Everest Re Group, Ltd.‘s consolidated financial statements and of its internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on
our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Everest Re Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 2006 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Internal control over financial
reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A., that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria
established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted
our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

F-2

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

EVEREST RE GROUP, LTD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. Business and Basis of
Presentation

Everest Re Group, Ltd.
(“Group”), a Bermuda company, through its subsidiaries, principally provides
reinsurance and insurance in the U.S., Bermuda and international markets. As used in this
document, the “Company” means Group and its subsidiaries. Prior to December 31,
2004, Group’s principal executive office was located in Barbados. On December 31,
2004 the Company closed its principal executive office in Barbados and established its
principal executive office in Bermuda.

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The statements include all of
the following domestic and foreign direct and indirect subsidiaries of Group: Everest
Reinsurance Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), Everest Reinsurance (Bermuda), Ltd.
(“Bermuda Re”), Everest International Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Everest
International”), Everest International Holdings, Ltd., Mt. McKinley Insurance Company
(“Mt. McKinley”), Everest Global Services, Inc. (“Global Services”),
Everest Advisors (UK), Ltd., Everest Advisors (Ireland) Limited, Everest Re Advisors,
Ltd., Everest Reinsurance Company (“Everest Re”), Everest National Insurance
Company (“Everest National”), Everest Indemnity Insurance Company (“Everest
Indemnity”), Everest Security Insurance Company (“Everest Security”),
Everest Insurance Company of Canada (“Everest Canada”), Mt. McKinley Managers,
L.L.C., Workcare Southeast, Inc. and Workcare Southeast of Georgia, Inc. All
amounts are reported in U.S. dollars.

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities) at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. Ultimate actual results could differ from those
estimates.

B. Investments

Fixed maturity investments are all
classified as available for sale. Unrealized appreciation and depreciation, as a result of
temporary changes in market value during the period, are reflected in shareholders’
equity, net of income taxes in “accumulated other comprehensive income”. Equity
securities are carried at market value with unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as a
result of temporary changes in market value during the period, reflected in
shareholders’ equity, net of income taxes in “accumulated other comprehensive
income”. Unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities, which are
deemed other than temporary, are charged to net income as realized capital losses.
Short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates market value. Realized gains
or losses on sale of investments are determined on the basis of identified cost. For
non-publicly traded securities, market prices are determined through the use of pricing
models that evaluate securities relative to the U.S. Treasury yield curve, taking into
account the issue type, credit quality and cash flow characteristics of each security. For
publicly traded securities, market value is based on quoted market prices. Retrospective
adjustments are employed to recalculate the values of loan-backed and asset-backed
securities. Each acquisition lot is reviewed to recalculate the effective yield. The
recalculated effective yield is used to derive a book value as if the new yield were
applied at the time of acquisition. Outstanding principal factors from the time of
acquisition to the adjustment date are used to calculate the prepayment history for all
applicable securities. Conditional prepayment rates, computed with life to date factor
histories and weighted average maturities, are used to affect the calculation of projected
and prepayments for pass-through security types. Other invested assets

F-8

include limited
partnerships and rabbi trusts. Limited partnerships are valued pursuant to the equity
method of accounting, which management believes approximates market value.

C. Uncollectible
Receivable Balances

The Company provides reserves for
uncollectible reinsurance balances based on management’s assessment of the
collectibility of the outstanding balances. Such reserves were $99.9 million at December
31, 2006, of which $62.0 million is due to the credit program, and $38.6 million at
December 31, 2005.

D. Deferred Acquisition
Costs

Acquisition costs, consisting
principally of commissions and brokerage expenses and certain premium taxes and fees that
vary with and are directly associated with the Company’s reinsurance and insurance
business incurred at the time a contract or policy is issued, are deferred and amortized
over the period in which the related premiums are earned, generally one year. Deferred
acquisition costs are limited to their estimated realizable value by line of business
based on the related unearned premiums, anticipated claims and claim expenses and
anticipated investment income. Deferred acquisition costs amortized to income were $883.3
million, $914.8 million and $975.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The present value of in force annuity
business is included in deferred acquisition costs. This value is amortized over the
expected life of the business at the time of acquisition. The amortization each year is a
function of the gross profits each year in relation to the total gross profits expected
over the life of the business, discounted at an assumed net credit rate.

E. Reserve for Losses and
Loss Adjustment Expenses

The reserve for losses and loss
adjustment expenses (“LAE”) is based on individual case estimates and reports
received from ceding companies. A provision is included for losses and LAE incurred but
not reported (“IBNR”) based on past experience. A provision is also included for
certain potential liabilities relating to asbestos and environmental (“A&E”)
exposures, which liabilities cannot be estimated with traditional reserving techniques.
See also Note 3. The reserves are reviewed periodically and any changes in estimates are
reflected in earnings in the period the adjustment is made. Management believes that
adequate provision has been made for the Company’s losses and LAE. Loss and LAE
reserves are presented gross of reinsurance receivables and incurred losses and LAE are
presented net of ceded reinsurance.

Accruals for commissions are
established for reinsurance contracts that provide for the stated commission percentage to
increase or decrease based on the loss experience of the contract. Changes in estimates
for such arrangements are recorded as commission expense. Accruals are determined through
the review of the contracts that have these adjustable features and are estimated based on
expected loss and LAE.

F. Future Policy Benefit
Reserve

Liabilities for future policy
benefits on annuity policies are carried at their accumulated values. Reserves for policy
benefits include both mortality and morbidity claims in the process of settlement and IBNR
claims. Interest rate assumptions used to estimate liabilities for policy benefits range
from 3.97% to 5.70%. Actual experience in a particular period may vary.

G. Premium Revenues

Written premiums are earned ratably
over the periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned
premium reserves are established to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period.
Such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies or
estimated using pro rata methods based on statistical data. Reinstatement premiums
represent additional premium received on catastrophe reinsurance coverages when limits
have been exhausted under the original reinsurance contract and

F-9

additional coverage is
granted. Written and earned premiums and the related costs, which have not yet been
reported to the Company are estimated and accrued. Premiums are net of ceded reinsurance.

Annuity premiums are recognized as
revenue over the premium-paying period of the policies.

H. Income Taxes

Holdings and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Foreign branches of
subsidiaries file local tax returns as required. Group and subsidiaries not included in
Holdings’ consolidated tax return file separate company U.S. federal income tax
returns as required. The UK branch of Bermuda Re files a UK income tax return. Deferred
income taxes have been recorded to recognize the tax effect of temporary differences
between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.

I. Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities relating to
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date; revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using average
exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial
statements, net of deferred income taxes, are excluded from net income and accumulated in
shareholders’ equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
are recorded through the statement of operations.

J. Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are
calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that would occur if
options granted under various share-based compensation plans were exercised resulting in
the issuance of common shares that would share in the earnings of the entity.

Net income (loss) per common share
has been computed below, based upon weighted average common and dilutive shares
outstanding.

Options to purchase 310,200 common
shares at prices ranging from $95.485 to $99.980 were outstanding at the end of 2006 and
options to purchase 315,000 common shares at prices ranging from $95.050 to $95.485 per
share were outstanding at the end of 2005 but were not included in the computation of
earnings per diluted share for 2006 and 2005, respectively, because the options’
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares. All
outstanding options expire on or between September 26, 2007 and September 27, 2016.

F-10

K. Segmentation

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting,
International and Bermuda. See also Note 18.

L. Derivatives

The Company has issued seven equity
put options in its product portfolio, which are outstanding. These products meet the
definition of a derivative under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS
133”). The Company’s position in these contracts is unhedged and is accounted
for as a derivative in accordance with FAS 133. Accordingly, these contracts are carried
at fair value and are recorded in “Other liabilities” in the consolidated
balance sheets and changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss).

M. Deposit Assets and
Liabilities

In the normal course of its
operations, the Company may enter into contracts that do not meet the risk transfer
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113, “Accounting and
Reporting for Reinsurance of Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts”. Such
contracts are accounted for using the deposit accounting method. For such contracts, the
Company originally records deposit liabilities for an amount equivalent to the assets
received. Actuarial studies are used to estimate the final liabilities under such
contracts with any change reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss).

N. Share-Based Employee
Compensation

Prior to 2002, the Company accounted
for its share-based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement
provisions of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”), and related
interpretations. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS 123”) prospectively to all employee awards
granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2002. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) “Share-Based
Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”). See also Note 16.

Prior to January 1, 2002, the
compensation cost for the Company’s share-based compensation plans were determined
based on APB 25. If the fair value at the grant dates for awards granted under those plans
prior to January 1, 2002 were calculated consistent with the method of FAS 123, the
Company’s net income (loss) and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts indicated below:

The fair value of each option grant
accounted for in accourdance with APB 25 was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: (i) dividend yields
ranging from 0.5% to 0.9%, (ii) expected volatility ranging from 32.9% to 45.8%, (iii)
risk-free interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 7.0% and (iv) expected lives of 7.3 to 7.5
years.

O. Policyholder Dividends

The Company issues certain insurance
policies with dividend payment features. These policyholders share in the operating
results of their respective policies in the form of dividends declared. Dividends to
policyholders are accrued during the period in which the related premiums are earned and
are determined based on the terms of the individual policies.

P. Application of New
Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FAS 123(R), which is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company adopted FAS 123(R) effective
January 1, 2006. FAS 123(R) requires all share-based compensation awards, granted,
modified or settled after December 15, 1994 to be accounted for using the fair value
method of accounting. Under the modified prospective application, compensation cost is
recognized for the outstanding, non-vested awards based on the grant date fair value of
those awards as calculated under FAS 123. The Company implemented FAS 123 prospectively
for grants issued on or after January 1, 2002. The adoption of FAS 123(R) resulted in
$169,037 of additional compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 for
options granted prior to FAS 123.

In November 2005, the FASB issued
FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 115-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“FAS 115-1”), which
is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. FAS 115-1 addresses
the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment
is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. FAS 115-1 also includes
accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary
impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses not recognized as
other-than-temporary impairments. The Company adopted FAS 115-1 prospectively effective
January 1, 2006. The Company believes that all unrealized losses in its investment
portfolio are temporary in nature.

In July 2006, the FASB released FASB
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“FAS
109”). FIN 48 prescribes the recognition and measurement criteria for the financial
statements for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Further, FIN
48 expands the required disclosures associated with uncertain tax positions. The Company
will adopt FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The Company does not believe the impact of
implementing FIN 48 will be material on its consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements”
(“FAS 157”), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. FAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value consistently in GAAP and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company will adopt FAS 157 on January 1,
2008. The Company does not believe the impact of implementing FAS 157 will be material on
its consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (“FAS 158”), which
is effective for employers with publicly traded equity securities as of the end of the
fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. FAS 158 requires an employer to (a) recognize
in its financial statements an asset for a plan’s over funded status or a liability
for a plan’s under funded status, (b) measure a plan’s assets and its
obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal
year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement
plan in the year in which the changes occur as other comprehensive income. The Company
adopted FAS 158 for the reporting period ended December 31, 2006. The impact on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006 was a $23.1 million
pre-tax, or $15.0 million after-tax, reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income.

F-12

Q. Investments –
Interest Only Strips

During 2005 and 2004, the Company
invested in interest only strips of mortgage-backed securities (“interest only
strips”). These securities give the holder the right to receive interest payments at
a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments on the
outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash
flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the mortgage
pool. Generally, as mortgage rates decline, mortgagors are more likely to prepay their
mortgage loans which decreases the average life of a mortgage pool and decreases expected
cash flows. Conversely, as mortgage rates rise, repayments are more likely to slow and
ultimate cash flows will tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments
tends to increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates
fall. These movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on
the Company’s other fixed income investments. The Company held no interest only
strips investments at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

The Company accounted for its
investment in interest only strips in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.
99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained
Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets” (“EITF 99-20”). EITF
99-20 sets forth the rules for recognizing interest income on all credit-sensitive
mortgage and asset-backed securities and certain prepayment-sensitive securities,
including agency interest only strips, whether purchased or retained in securitization, as
well as the rules for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value
because of impairment. EITF 99-20 requires decreases in the valuation of residual
interests in securitizations to be recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the
residual interests through a charge to earnings, rather than an unrealized loss in
shareholders’ equity, when any portion of the decline in fair value is attributable
to, as defined by EITF 99-20, an impairment loss. The Company recorded a pre-tax and
after-tax realized capital loss due to impairments of $7.0 million and $5.6 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $65.1 million and $49.7 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004. As a result of liquidating the
interest only strips portfolios, the Company recognized pre-tax and after-tax realized
capital gains of $41.3 million and $32.5 million, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2005 and pre-tax and after-tax realized capital gains of $118.2 million and
$91.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The Company frequently reviews its
investment portfolio for declines in market value and focuses its attention on securities
whose fair value has fallen below 80% of their amortized value at the time of review. The
Company then assesses whether the decline in value is temporary or “other than
temporary”. In making its assessment, the Company evaluates the current market and
interest rate environment as well as specific issuer information and the Company’s
ability and intent to hold to maturity. Generally, a change in the market or interest rate
environment does not constitute impairment but rather a temporary decline in market value.
Temporary declines in market value are recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other
comprehensive income. If the Company determines that the decline is “other than
temporary”, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value and a
realized loss is recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s assessments are based on the issuer’s
current and expected future financial position, timeliness with respect to interest and/or
principal payments, speed of repayments on asset-backed securities, as well as relevant
information provided by rating agencies, investment advisors and analysts.

The aggregate fair value and gross
unrealized losses related to investments in an unrealized loss position as of December 31,
2006 is $5,635.8 million and $122.8 million, respectively. There are no material
concentrations of unrealized losses by issuer, security type or industry within the fixed
maturity portfolio. The $21.9 million of unrealized losses related to fixed maturity
securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than one year are
generally comprised of highly rated government, municipal and corporate bonds and are
primarily the result of interest rates being higher than when the securities were
purchased. Of these unrealized losses, $20.6 million are related to securities that are
rated investment grade or better by a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization.

The $100.9 million of unrealized
losses related to fixed maturity securities that have been in an unrealized loss position
for more than one year are also primarily comprised of highly rated government, municipal
and corporate bonds and are the result of interest rates being higher than when the
securities were purchased. Of

F-16

these unrealized losses, $94.8 million are related to
securities that are rated investment grade or better by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization.

The Company, given the size of its
investment portfolio and capital position, has the ability to hold these securities until
recovery of market value. In addition, all securities currently in an unrealized loss
position are current with respect to principal and interest payments.

The table below displays the
aggregate fair value and gross unrealized depreciation, by investment category and length
of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as
of December 31, 2005:

The aggregate fair value and gross
unrealized losses related to investments in an unrealized loss position as of December 31,
2005 are $4,596.8 million and $103.1 million, respectively. The $48.9 million of unrealized
losses related to fixed maturity securities that have been in an unrealized loss position
for less than one year are generally comprised of highly rated government, municipal and
corporate bonds and are primarily the result of interest rates being higher than when the
securities were purchased. Of these unrealized losses, $44.3 million are related to
securities that are rated investment grade or better by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization.

The $52.5 million of unrealized
losses related to fixed maturity securities that have been in an unrealized loss position
for more than one year are also primarily comprised of highly rated government, municipal
and corporate bonds and are the result of interest rates being higher than when the
securities were purchased. Of these unrealized losses, $49.1 million are related to
securities that are rated investment grade or better by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization.

Proceeds from sales of fixed maturity
investments during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $182.9 million, $1,420.3 million and $1,451.2
million, respectively. Gross gains of $14.9 million, $89.6 million and $163.8 million and
gross losses of $2.1 million, $5.3 million and $8.3 million were realized on those fixed
maturity sales during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Proceeds from sales of equity
security investments during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $281.1 million, $218.0 million and
$18.0 million, respectively. Gross gains of $34.1 million, $16.6 million and $0.5 million
and gross losses of $11.8 million, $3.6 million and $0.9 million were realized on those
equity sales during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Net realized capital gains include
$0.0 million, $7.0 million and $65.1 million of realized capital losses for 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively, related to the impairment of interest only strips in accordance with
EITF 99-20. In addition, realized capital losses for 2006, 2005 and 2004 included $13.3
thousand, $7.0 million and $522.6 thousand, respectively, related to write-downs in the
value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis.

Securities with a carrying value
amount of $1,352.8 million at December 31, 2006 were on deposit with various state or
governmental insurance departments in compliance with insurance laws.

The Company has sold six equity put
options based on the Standard & Poor’s 500 (“S&P 500”) index for
total consideration, net of commission, of $22.5 million. At December 31, 2006, fair value
for these equity put options was $30.1 million. These contracts each have a single
exercise date, with original maturities ranging from 12 to 30 years and strike prices
ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these contracts if
the S&P 500 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise dates, which
currently fall

F-18

between June 2017 and March 2031. If the S&P 500 index is lower than
the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due would vary
proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. The
theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise
dates the S&P 500 index value were zero. The present value of these theoretical
maximum payouts using a 6% discount factor is $213.2 million. Based on historical index
volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2006 index value, the Company estimates the
probability that each S&P 500 index contract will be below the strike price on the
exercise date to be between 0.2% and 4.4%.

The Company has sold one equity put
option based on the FTSE 100 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $6.7
million. At December 31, 2006, fair value for this equity put option was $7.4 million.
This contract has an exercise date of July 2020 and a strike price of £5,989.75. No
amount will be payable under this contract if the FTSE 100 index is at or above the strike
price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index is lower than the strike price on the
applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by
which the index is below the strike price. The theoretical maximum payout under the
contract would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was zero. The
present value of the theoretical maximum payout using a 6.0% discount factor and current
exchange rate is $29.2 million. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the
December 31, 2006 index value, the Company estimates the probability that this FTSE 100
index contract will be below the strike price on the exercise date to be 7.0%.

These equity put options meet the
definition of a derivative under FAS 133. The Company’s position in these contracts
is unhedged and is accounted for as a derivative in accordance with FAS 133. Accordingly,
these contracts are carried at fair value and are recorded in “Other
liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets and changes in fair value are
recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.

As there is no active market for
these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted
option pricing model, Black-Scholes, which requires estimates and assumptions, including
those regarding volatility and expected rates of return.

3. RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LAE

Activity in the reserve for losses
and LAE is summarized as follows:

Gross loss and LAE reserves are
$8,840.1 million at December 31, 2006, $9,126.7 million at December 31, 2005 and $7,836.3
million at December 31, 2004. The decrease in 2006 was primarily attributable to lower
current year catastrophe losses and a decrease in earned premiums. The increase in 2005
was primarily attributable to elevated catastrophe loss reserves, partially offset by an
increase in claim settlements, a decrease in premiums earned and favorable net prior
period reserve adjustments. The increase in 2004 was primarily attributable to increased
premiums earned, net prior period reserve adjustments in select areas, increase in
catastrophe losses and normal variability in claim settlements.

Reinsurance receivables for both paid
and unpaid losses totaled $772.8 million at December 31, 2006, $1,048.7 million at
December 31, 2005 and $1,210.8 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2006, $169.4
million, or 21.9%, was receivable from Transatlantic Reinsurance Company
(“Transatlantic”), $100.9 million, or 13.1%, was receivable from LM Property and
Casualty Insurance Company (“LM”), which in late 2003 purchased Prudential
Property and Casualty Insurance Company of Indiana (“Prupac”) and whose
obligations continue to be guaranteed by The Prudential Insurance Company of America
(“The Prudential”), $100.2 million, or 13.0%, was receivable from Founders
Insurance Company Limited (“Founders”), which is partially collateralized by a
trust, $100.0 million, or 12.9%, was receivable from Continental Insurance Company
(“Continental”), which is partially collateralized by funds held arrangements,
$52.5 million, or 6.8%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London
Reinsurance Group (“London Life”), which is fully collateralized by letters of credit,
and $42.7 million,
or 5.5%, was receivable from Munich Reinsurance Company (“Munich
Re”). Continental is collateralized by a
funds held arrangement under which the Company has
retained the premium payments due the retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for such
amounts and reduced such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire.
No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s receivables.

The Company continues to receive
claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts, asserting alleged injuries
and/or damages that occurred while the contracts were in force relating to or resulting
from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos (i.e. A&E).
The Company’s asbestos claims typically involve potential liability for bodily injury
from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products
containing asbestos. The Company’s environmental claims typically involve potential
liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b)
bodily injury or property damages caused by the release of hazardous substances into the
land, air or water.

As of December 31, 2006, roughly 7%
of the Company’s gross reserves are an estimate of the Company’s ultimate
liability for A&E claims. The Company’s A&E liabilities stem from Mt.
McKinley’s direct insurance business and Everest Re’s assumed reinsurance
business. This estimate is made based on assessments of the underlying exposures as the
result of (1) long and variable reporting delays, both from insureds to insurance
companies and from ceding companies to reinsurers; (2) historical data, which is more
limited and variable on A&E losses than historical information on other types of
casualty claims; and (3) unique aspects of A&E exposures for which ultimate value
cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. There are significant
uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E
claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potential passing of many years between exposure
and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying
sources of asbestos or environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating
responsibility and/or liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in
underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an
asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy
periods; (f) questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and
reinsurance coverage; and (g) uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds
with potential asbestos or environmental exposure.

With respect to asbestos claims in
particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound
the difficulty in estimating the Company’s liability. These developments include: (a)
the significant growth over a short period of time in the number of claims filed, in part
reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar and including claims against defendants
who may only have a “peripheral” connection to asbestos; (b) a disproportionate
percentage of claims filed by individuals with no physical injury, which should have
little to no financial value but which have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts
and settlements; (c) the growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy filings by
companies as a result of asbestos claims (including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in
which companies attempt to resolve their asbestos liabilities in a manner that is
prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers from participating in the negotiation of
asbestos related bankruptcy reorganization plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a
small number of states that favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims that
might impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product
liability portion; (f) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst
procedural abuses; (g) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants,
especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some states to
address asbestos litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or the U. S.
Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation. Anecdotal evidence suggest that new

F-21

claims filing rates have decreased, that new filings of asbestos-driven bankruptcies have
decreased and legislative reforms are beginning to diminish the potential ultimate
liability for asbestos losses.

Management believes that these
uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for A&E and particularly
asbestos losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves
for other types of losses. Given these uncertainties, management believes that no
meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established, particularly for asbestos.
Further, A&E reserves may be subject to more variability than non-A&E reserves and
such variation could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operation and/or cash flow. The Company establishes reserves to the
extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an
exposure for the Company or its ceding companies.

The following table summarizes
incurred losses with respect to A&E on both a gross and net of retrocessional basis
for the years indicated:

At December 31, 2006, the gross
reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $135.6 million representing case reserves
reported by ceding companies, $152.1 million representing additional case reserves
established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $213.7 million representing case
reserves established by the Company on direct excess insurance claims, including Mt.
McKinley and $148.7 million representing IBNR reserves. Roughly 89%, or $581.0 million, of
gross A&E reserves relate to asbestos of which $320.5 million was for assumed business
and $260.5 million was for direct excess business.

In connection with the acquisition of
Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, LM provided reinsurance to
Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the first $200.0 million of any adverse
development of Mt. McKinley’s reserves as of September 19, 2000 and The Prudential
guaranteed LM’s obligations to Mt. McKinley. Cessions under this reinsurance
agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at December 31, 2003.

4. CREDIT LINES

Effective December 8, 2004, Group,
Bermuda Re and Everest International entered into a three year, $750.0 million senior
credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Group Credit Facility”).
Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility. The Group Credit
Facility consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $250.0 million of revolving
credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of standby
letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the option of each of the
borrowers, be either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of
the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or
the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin

F-22

and the
fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depends on Group’s senior unsecured debt
rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500.0 million for the issuance of standby
letters of credit on a collateralized basis.

The Group Credit Facility requires
Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a
minimum net worth amount. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of (i) $2,898.0
million (base amount) plus (ii) (A) 25% of consolidated net income for each of
Group’s fiscal quarters and (B) 50% of any increase in consolidated net worth
attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. The base amount is reset at
the end of each fiscal year to be the greater of 70% of Group’s consolidated net
worth as of the last day of the fiscal year and the calculated minimum amount of net worth
prior to the last day of the fiscal year. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants.

For the year ended December 31, 2006,
there were no outstanding borrowings under tranche one of the Group Credit Facility.
During the year ended December 31, 2006, there was $185.4 million used of the $500.0
million available for tranche two standby letters of credit. See Note 7.

Effective August 23, 2006, Holdings
entered into a new five year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of lenders, replacing the October 10, 2003 three year senior revolving credit
facility, which expired on October 10, 2006. Both the August 23, 2006 and October 10, 2003
senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the
“Holdings Credit Facility”. Citibank N.A. is the administrative agent for the
Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general
corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to
$150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base
Rate (as defined below) or (2) a periodic fixed rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus an
applicable margin. The Base Rate means a fluctuating interest rate per annum in effect
from time to time to be equal to the higher of (a) the rate of interest publicly announced
by Citibank as its prime rate or 0.5% per annum above the Federal Funds Rate, in each case
plus the applicable margin. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Holdings
Credit Facility depends upon Holdings’ senior unsecured debt rating.

The Holdings Credit Facility requires
Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and Everest Re
to maintain its statutory surplus of no less than $1.5 billion plus 25% of future
aggregate net income and 25% of future aggregate capital contributions after December 31,
2005. As of December 31, 2006, Holdings was in compliance with these covenants.

During the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, there were no payments made and no incremental borrowings under the
Holdings Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2004, there were payments
made of $70.0 million and no incremental borrowings under the Holdings Credit Facility. As
of December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Holdings
Credit Facility.

Interest expense and fees incurred in
connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings Credit Facility were $0.4
million, $0.4 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

5. SENIOR NOTES

On October 12, 2004, Holdings
completed a public offering of $250.0 million principal amount of 5.40% senior notes due
October 15, 2014. On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed public offerings of $200.0 million
principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15, 2010 and $250.0 million principal
amount of 8.50% senior notes due and retired March 15, 2005.

Interest expense incurred in
connection with these senior notes was $31.1 million, $35.5 million and $42.0 million for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Market value, which is
based on quoted market price at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $248.1 million and $250.9
million, respectively, for the 5.40% senior notes and $219.8 million and $226.2 million,
respectively, for the 8.75% senior notes.

6. JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES PAYABLE

On March 29, 2004, Holdings issued
$329.9 million of 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities due March 29, 2034 to Everest
Re Capital Trust II (“Capital Trust II”). Holdings can redeem the junior
subordinated debt securities before their maturity at 100% of their principal amount plus
accrued interest as of the date of redemption, in whole or in part, on one or more
occasions at any time on or after March 30, 2009; or at any time, in whole, but not in
part, within 90 days of the occurrence and continuation of a determination that the Trust
may become subject to tax or the Investment Company Act.

On November 14, 2002, Holdings issued
$216.5 million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities due November 15, 2032 to
Everest Re Capital Trust (“Capital Trust”). Holdings can redeem the junior
subordinated debt securities before their maturity at 100% of their principal amount plus
accrued interest as of the date of redemption, in whole or in part, on one or more
occasions at any time on or after November 14, 2007; or at any time, in whole, but not in
part, within 90 days of the occurrence and continuation of a determination that the Trust
may become subject to tax or the Investment Company Act.

Fair value, which is primarily based
on quoted market price of the related trust preferred securities at December 31, 2006 and
2005, was $316.3 million and $293.5 million, respectively, for the 6.20% junior
subordinated debt securities and $221.2 million and $220.5 million, respectively, for the
7.85% junior subordinated debt securities.

Interest expense incurred in
connection with these junior subordinated notes was $37.4 million, $37.4 million and $32.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Capital Trust and Capital Trust II
are wholly owned finance subsidiaries of Holdings.

Holdings considers that the
mechanisms and obligations relating to the trust preferred securities, taken together,
constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by Holdings of Capital Trust and Capital
Trust II’s payment obligations with respect to their respective trust preferred
securities.

Capital Trust and Capital Trust II
must redeem all of the outstanding trust preferred securities when the junior subordinated
debt securities are paid at maturity on November 15, 2032 and March 29, 2034,
respectively. The Company may elect to redeem the junior subordinated debt securities, in
whole or in part, at any time on or after November 14, 2007 and March 30, 2009,
respectively. If such an early redemption occurs, the outstanding trust preferred
securities would also be proportionately redeemed.

There are certain regulatory and
contractual restrictions on the ability of Holdings’ operating subsidiaries to
transfer funds to Holdings in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The insurance
laws of the State of Delaware, where Holdings’ direct insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled, require regulatory approval before those

F-24

subsidiaries can pay dividends or make
loans or advances to Holdings that exceed certain statutory thresholds. In addition, the
terms of Holdings’ Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4) require Everest Re,
Holdings’ principal insurance subsidiary, to maintain a certain statutory surplus
level as measured at the end of each fiscal year. At December 31, 2006, $2,451.4 million
of the $3,102.6 million in net assets of Holdings’ consolidated subsidiaries were
subject to the foregoing regulatory restrictions.

7. LETTERS OF CREDIT

The Company has arrangements
available for the issuance of letters of credit, which letters are generally
collateralized by the Company’s cash and investments. The Company’s agreement
with Citibank is a bilateral letter of credit agreement only, while the Company’s
other facility, the Wachovia Syndicated Facility, involves a syndicate of lenders (see
Note 4, tranche two of the Group Credit Facility), with Wachovia acting as administrative
agent. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, letters of credit for $460.0 million and $350.6
million, respectively, were issued and outstanding, generally supporting reinsurance
provided by the Company’s non-U.S. operations. The following table summarizes the
Company’s letters of credit as of December 31, 2006.

8. TRUST AGREEMENTS

Certain reinsurance subsidiaries of
Group, principally Bermuda Re, have established trust agreements as security for assumed
losses payable to certain non-affiliated ceding companies, which effectively use their
investments as collateral. At December 31, 2006, the total amount on deposit in trust
accounts was $135.7 million.

F-25

9. OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS

The future minimum rental
commitments, exclusive of cost escalation clauses, at December 31, 2006 for all of the
Company’s operating leases with remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year
are as follows:

was $8.5 million, $7.1 million and $7.6 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

10. INCOME TAXES

Under Bermuda law, no income or
capital gains taxes are imposed on Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries. The Minister of
Finance of Bermuda has also assured Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries that, pursuant to
The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966, they will be exempt until 2016 from
imposition of any such taxes.

All the income of Group’s U.S.
subsidiaries is subject to the applicable federal, foreign, state and local taxes on
corporations. Additionally, the income of foreign branches of the Company’s insurance
operating companies, in particular the UK branch of Bermuda Re, is subject to various
income taxes. The provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income (loss) has been determined in accordance with the individual
income of each entity and the respective applicable tax laws. The provision reflects the
permanent differences between financial and taxable income relevant to each entity. The
significant components of the provision are as follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax
effect of the temporary differences between the value of assets and liabilities for
financial statement purposes and such values as measured by the U.S. tax laws and
regulations. The principal items making up the net deferred income tax asset are as
follows:

For U.S. income tax purposes the
Company has foreign tax credit carryforwards of $64.6 million that begin to expire in
2011. In addition, for U.S. income tax purposes the Company has $35.4 million of
Alternative Minimum Tax credits that do not expire. Management believes that it is more
likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets
and accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded for the periods presented.

F-27

Tax benefits of $6.1 million and $5.6
million related to compensation expense deductions for stock options exercised in 2006 and
2005, respectively, are reflected in the change in shareholders’ equity in
“additional paid-in capital”. In addition, during 2005, the Company sold
treasury shares resulting in proceeds of $46.5 million compared with a cost basis of $23.0
million. Additional paid-in capital was reduced by $8.2 million of income taxes resulting
from this transaction.

11. REINSURANCE

The Company utilizes reinsurance
agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. These
agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and LAE under
certain circumstances without relieving the ceding company of its obligations to the
policyholders. Losses and LAE incurred and premiums earned are reported after deduction
for reinsurance. In the event that one or more of the reinsurers were unable to meet their
obligations under these reinsurance agreements, the Company would not realize the full
value of the reinsurance recoverable balances. The Company may hold partial collateral,
including letters of credit and funds held, under these agreements. See also Note 1C.

For years ended December 31, 1999,
2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession
coverage that provided up to $175.0 million of coverage for each year. These excess of
loss policies provided coverage if Everest Re’s consolidated statutory basis accident
year loss ratio exceeded a specified loss ratio attachment point for each year of
coverage. The attachment point was net of inuring reinsurance and included adjustable
premium provisions that effectively caused the Company to offset, on a pre-tax income
basis up to approximately 57% of such ceded losses. The maximum recovery for each year is
$175.0 million before giving effect to the adjustable premium. During 2003, the Company
ceded $85.0 million of losses, to the 2000 cover, effectively exhausting the maximum limit
under the contract. The 2001 and 1999 accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession
coverages were fully exhausted prior to January 1, 2003. The Company did not purchase
similar corporate level coverage subsequent to December 31, 2001.

In addition, the Company had coverage
under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement provided by LM in connection with
the Company’s acquisition of Mt. McKinley in September 2000. This agreement covers
80% or $160.0 million of the first $200 million of any adverse loss reserve development on
the carried reserves of Mt. McKinley at the date of acquisition and reimburses the Company
as such losses are paid by the Company. There were $160.0 million of recoverables under
this reinsurance at December 31, 2003. The Prudential continues to guarantee LM’s
obligation under this agreement.

Premiums written and earned are
comprised of the following:

F-28

The amounts deducted from losses and
LAE incurred for net reinsurance recoveries were $109.5 million, $95.2 million and $141.0
million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company
carried as an asset $772.8 million in reinsurance receivables with respect to losses
ceded. Of this amount, $169.4 million, or 21.9%, was receivable from Transatlantic, $100.9
million, or 13.1%, was receivable from LM, $100.2 million, or 13.0%, was receivable from
Founders, of which $38.3 million is held in a trust, $100.0 million, or 12.9%, was
receivable from Continental,  $52.5 million, or 6.8%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Life and
$42.7 million, or 5.5%, was receivable from Munich Re. As of December
31, 2005, the Company had $1,048.7 million in reinsurance receivables. Of this amount,
$239.8 million, or 22.9%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Life, $171.5 million,
or 16.4%, was receivable from Transatlantic, $160.0 million, or 15.3%, was receivable from
LM and $100.0 million, or 9.5%, was receivable from Continental. No other retrocessionaire
accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s receivables.

The Company’s arrangements with
London Life and Continental are managed on a funds held basis, which means that the
Company has retained the premiums earned by the retrocessionaire to secure obligations of
the retrocessionaire, recorded them as a liability, credited interest on the balances at a
stated contractual rate and reduced the liability account as payments become due. As of
December 31, 2006, such funds had reduced the Company’s net exposure to
Continental to $33.2 million. As of December 31, 2005, such funds had reduced
the Company’s net exposure to London Life to $115.4 million, effectively 100% of
which has been secured by letters of credit, and its exposure to Continental to $38.7
million.

13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

A. Defined Benefit
Pension Plans

The Company maintains both qualified
and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for its U.S. employees. Generally, the
Company computes the benefits based on average earnings over a period prescribed by the
plans and credited length of service. The Company’s non-qualified defined benefit
pension plan, affected in October 1995, provides compensating pension benefits for
participants whose benefits have been curtailed under the qualified plan due to Internal
Revenue Code limitations.

Although not required to make
contributions under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Company contributed $22.8
million and $3.9 million to the qualified plan in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Pension
expense for the Company’s plans for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
was $9.2 million, $6.9 million and $5.3 million, respectively.

The following table summarizes the
status of these defined benefit plans for U.S. employees for years ended December 31 as
indicated:

Plan assets consist of shares in
investment trusts with approximately 59% and 12% of the underlying assets consisting of
equity securities and fixed maturities, respectively, and 29% in cash and cash equivalents
due to an employer pension contribution.

Net periodic benefit cost for U.S.
employees included the following components for years ended December 31 as indicated:

The estimated transition obligation,
actuarial loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next year are $0, $1,868,005
and $126,908, respectively.

The weighted average discount rates
used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for
2006, 2005 and 2004 were 5.94%, 5.50% and 5.75%, respectively. The rate of compensation
increase used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation
for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 4.5%. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for
2006, 2005 and 2004 was 8.0%, 8.0% and 9.0%, respectively, and was based on portfolio
returns and allocations.

The Company manages the qualified
plan investments for U.S. employees. The assets in the plan consist of debt and equity
mutual funds. Due to the long term nature of the plan, the target asset allocation
consists of 70% equities and 30% bonds.

The Company expects to contribute
approximately $4.0 million in 2007 to the qualified plan.

B. Defined Contribution
Plans

The Company also maintains both
qualified and non-qualified defined contribution plans (“Savings Plan” and
“Non-Qualified Savings Plan”, respectively) covering U.S. employees. Under the
plans, the Company contributes up to a maximum 3% of the participants’ compensation
based on the contribution percentage of the employee. The Non-Qualified Savings Plan
provides compensating savings plan benefits for participants whose benefits have been
curtailed under the Savings Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations. The
Company’s incurred expenses related to these plans were $1.0 million in 2006, 2005
and 2004.

In addition, the Company maintains
several defined contribution pension plans covering non-U.S. employees. Each non-U.S.
office (Canada, London, Belgium, Singapore and Bermuda) maintains a separate plan for the
non-U.S. employees working in that location. The Company contributes various amounts based
on salary, age and/or years of service. The contributions as a percentage of salary for
the branch offices range from 5% to 15%. The contributions are generally used to purchase
pension benefits from local insurance providers. The Company’s incurred expenses
related to these plans were $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million for 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

C. Post-Retirement Plan

Beginning January 1, 2002, the
Company established the Retiree Health Plan. This plan provides health care benefits for
eligible retired employees (and their eligible dependants), who have elected coverage. The
Company currently anticipates that most covered employees will become eligible for these
benefits if they retire while working for the Company. The cost of these benefits is
shared with the retiree. The Company accrues the post-retirement benefit expense during
the period of the employee’s service.

A health care inflation rate for
pre-Medicare claims of 10% in 2006 was assumed to decrease to 9% in 2007 and decrease one
percentage point annually to 5% in 2011 and then remain at that level.

A health care inflation rate for
post-Medicare claims of 6% in 2006 was assumed to decrease to 5% in 2007 and then remain
at that level.

Changes in the assumed health care
cost trend can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
plans. A one percent change in the rate would have the following effects on:

14. DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS AND STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

A. Dividend Restrictions

Under Bermuda law, Group is
prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would reduce the realizable
value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its
issued share capital and share premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts. Group’s
ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is dependent upon dividends from its
subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends by insurer subsidiaries is limited under
Bermuda law and the laws of the various U.S. states in which Group’s insurance and
reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled. The limitations are generally
based upon net income and compliance with applicable policyholders’ surplus or
minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio requirements as determined in accordance with
the relevant statutory accounting practices.

Under Bermuda law, Bermuda Re is
prohibited from declaring or making payment of a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum
solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio. As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is also
unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless, after
payment of the dividend, the value of the assets in its long-term business fund, as
certified by its approved actuary, exceeds its liabilities for long-term business by at
least the $250,000 minimum solvency margin. Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary
Authority is required if Bermuda Re’s dividend payments would reduce its prior
year-end total statutory capital by 15.0% or more.

Delaware law provides that an
insurance company which is a member of an insurance holding company system and is
domiciled in the state shall not pay dividends without giving prior notice to the
Insurance Commissioner of Delaware and may not pay dividends without the approval of the
Insurance Commissioner if the value of the proposed dividend, together with all other
dividends and distributions made in the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of
(1) 10% of statutory surplus or (2) net income, not including realized capital gains, each
as reported in the prior year’s statutory annual statement. In addition, no dividend
may be paid in excess of

F-36

unassigned earned surplus. At December 31, 2006, Everest Re had
$270.4 million available for payment of dividends in 2007 without the need for prior
regulatory approval.

B. Statutory Financial
Information

Everest Re prepares its statutory
financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) and the Delaware
Insurance Department. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in the NAIC
Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. The capital and statutory surplus of Everest
Re was $2,704.1 million (unaudited) and $2,327.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The statutory net income of Everest Re was $298.7 million (unaudited) for
the year ended December 31, 2006, the statutory net loss was $26.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005 and the statutory net income $175.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

Bermuda Re prepares its statutory
financial statements in conformity with the accounting principles set forth in Bermuda in
The Insurance Act 1978, amendments thereto and related regulations. The statutory capital
and surplus of Bermuda Re was $1,893.9 million (unaudited) and $1,522.5 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The statutory net income of Bermuda Re was
$409.8 million (unaudited) for the year ended December 31, 2006, the statutory net loss
was $220.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the statutory net income was
$248.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

15. CONTINGENCIES

In the ordinary course of business,
the Company is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute
resolution procedures, the outcomes of which will determine the Company’s rights and
obligations under insurance, reinsurance and other contractual agreements. In some
disputes, the Company seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds
owing to it. In other matters, the Company is resisting attempts by others to collect
funds or enforce alleged rights. These disputes arise from time to time and as they arise
are addressed, and ultimately resolved, through both informal and formal means, including
negotiated resolution, arbitration and litigation. In all such matters, the Company
believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable. While the final
outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe
that any of these matters, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position or liquidity. However, an adverse resolution of one
or more of these items in any one quarter or fiscal year could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s results of operations in that period.

In 1993 and prior, the Company had a
business arrangement with The Prudential wherein, for a fee, the Company accepted settled
claim payment obligations of certain property and casualty insurers, and, concurrently,
became the owner of the annuity or assignee of the annuity proceeds funded by the property
and casualty insurers specifically to fulfill these fully settled obligations. In these
circumstances, the Company would be liable if The Prudential, which has an A+ (Superior)
financial strength rating from A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), were unable to
make the annuity payments. The estimated cost to replace all such annuities for which the
Company was contingently liable at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $150.5 million and
$155.3 million, respectively.

Prior to its 1995 initial public
offering, the Company purchased annuities from an unaffiliated life insurance company with
an A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from A.M. Best to settle certain claim
liabilities of the Company. Should the life insurance company become unable to make the
annuity payments, the Company would be liable for those claim liabilities. The estimated
cost to replace such annuities at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $20.2 million and $18.8
million, respectively.

16. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company has a 2002 Stock
Incentive Plan (“2002 Employee Plan”), a 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (“1995
Employee Plan”), a 2003 Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Plan (“2003
Director Plan”) and a 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (“1995
Director Plan”). In addition, the Company has awarded options to non-employee
directors in Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999. On January 1, 2002 the Company
implemented FAS 123 and related interpretations for these plans and Board actions and
January 1, 2006 the Company implemented FAS 123(R).

Under the 2002 Employee Plan,
4,000,000 common shares have been authorized to be granted as share options, share awards
or restricted share awards to officers and key employees of the Company. At December 31,
2006, there were 2,232,350 remaining shares available to be granted under the 2002
Employee Plan. The 2002 Employee Plan replaced the 1995 Employee Plan; therefore, no
further awards will be granted under the 1995 Employee Plan. Under the 2003 Director Plan,
500,000 common shares have been authorized to be granted as share options or share awards
to non-employee directors of the Company. At December 31, 2006 there were 477,500
remaining shares available to be granted under the 2003 Director Plan. Under the 1995
Director Plan, a total of 50,000 common shares have been authorized to be granted as share
options to non-employee directors of the Company. At December 31, 2006, there were 37,439
remaining shares available to be granted under the 1995 Director Plan.

Board actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
which were not approved by shareholders, awarded options to non-employee directors. The
Board actions were designed to award non-employee directors with the option to purchase
common shares to increase their ownership interest in the Company of non-employee
directors whose services are considered essential to the Company’s continued
progress, to align such interests with those of the shareholders of the Company and to
provide them with a further incentive to serve as directors to the Company. Under Board
actions in 2001, 2000 and 1999; 40,000, 30,000 and 26,000 common shares have been granted
as share options to non-employee directors of the Company.

Options granted under the 2002
Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at the earlier of 20% per year over five
years or upon the expiration of any applicable employment agreement, options granted under
the 1995 Director Plan vest at 50% per year over two years and options granted under the
2003 Director Plan and the 2001, 2000 and 1999 Board actions vest at 33% per year over
three years. All options are exercisable at fair market value of the stock at the date of
grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. Restricted shares granted under the
2002 Employee Plan and the 1995 Employee Plan vest at the earliest of 20% per year over
five years or upon the expiration of any applicable employment agreement.

For share options granted, nonvested
shares granted and shares issued under the 2002 Employee Plan, the 1995 Employee Plan, the
2003 Director Plan and the 1995 Director Plan, share-based compensation expense recognized
in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income was $15.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006. The corresponding income tax benefit recorded in the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for share-based
compensation was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, there was
$12.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation expense. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.1 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, was $4.5 million, $1.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
The tax benefit realized from the shares vested for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
$0.7 million.

In addition to the 2002 Employee
Plan, the 1995 Employee Plan, the 2003 Director Plan and the 1995 Director Plan, Group
issued 1,661 common shares in 2006, 1,962 common shares in 2005 and 2,283 common shares in
2004 to the Company’s non-employee directors as compensation for their service as
directors in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These issuances had aggregate values of
approximately $157,000, $180,000 and $185,000, respectively.

Since its 1995 initial public
offering, the Company has issued to certain key employees of the Company 325,000
restricted common shares, of which 19,960 restricted shares have been cancelled. The
Company has issued to non-employee directors of the Company 10,000 restricted common
shares, of which no restricted shares have been cancelled. The Company acquired 21,595,
10,645 and 5,100 common shares at a cost of $2.1 million, $1.0 million and $0.4 million in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from employees who chose to pay required withholding
taxes with shares exercised under the share option grants or restricted shares, which
became unrestricted. The Company acquired 328 common shares at a cost of $32,905 in 2005
from non-employee directors who chose to pay the option exercise price with shares.

17. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

During the normal course of business,
the Company, through its affiliates, engages in reinsurance and brokerage and commission
business transactions, which management believes to be at arm’s-length, with
companies controlled by or affiliated with its outside directors. Such transactions,
individually and in the aggregate, are not material to the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

18. SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company, through its
subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty
Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property
and casualty reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance
brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance
operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agents and
surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation writes accident
and health (“A&H”), marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and
worldwide through

F-42

brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation
writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re’s branches in Canada and
Singapore, in addition to foreign business written through Everest Re’s Miami and New
Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide
property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and
directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and reinsurance to the United
Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch.

These segments are managed in a
carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control with respect to
pricing, risk management, control of aggregate exposures to catastrophe events, capital,
investments and support operations. Management generally monitors and evaluates the
financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results.
Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and
brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in
particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which,
respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting
expenses by earned premium. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance, but such
reinsurance generally does not impact segment results, as business is generally reported
within the segment in which the business was first produced.

The Company does not maintain
separate balance sheet data for its operating segments. Accordingly, the Company does not
review and evaluate the financial results of its operating segments based upon balance
sheet data.

The following tables represent the
relevant underwriting results for the operating segments for the three years ended
December 31:
