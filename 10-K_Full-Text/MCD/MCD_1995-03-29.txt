                                     PART I

     Item 1.   Business

          McDonald's Corporation, the registrant, together with its
     subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the "Company".

          (a)  General development of business

           There have been no significant changes to the Company's
     corporate structure during 1994, nor material changes in the Company's
     method of conducting business.

          (b)  Financial information about industry segments

           Industry segment data for the years ended December 31, 1994,
     1993 and 1992 is included in Part II, item 8, page 42 of this
     Form 10-K.

          (c)  Narrative description of business

          General

           The Company develops, operates, franchises and services a
     worldwide system of restaurants which prepare, assemble, package and
     sell a limited menu of value-priced foods. These restaurants are
     operated by the Company or, under the terms of franchise arrangements,
     by franchisees who are independent third parties, or by affiliates
     operating under joint-venture agreements between the Company and local
     businesspeople.

           The Company's franchising program assures consistency and
     quality.  The Company is selective in granting franchises and is not
     in the practice of franchising to investor groups or passive
     investors.  Under the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees
     supply capital - initially, by purchasing equipment, signs, seating,
     and decor, and over the long term, by reinvesting in the business.
     The Company shares the investment by owning or leasing the land and
     building; franchisees then contribute to the Company's revenues
     through payment of rent and service fees based upon a percent of
     sales, with specified minimum payments.  Generally, the conventional
     franchise arrangement lasts 20 years and franchising practices are
     consistent throughout the world.  Further discussion regarding site
     selection is included in Part 1, item 2, page 6 of this Form 10-K.

           Training begins at the restaurant with one-on-one instruction
     and videotapes.  Aspiring restaurant managers progress through a
     development program of classes in basic and intermediate operations,
     management and equipment.  Assistant managers are eligible to attend
     the advanced operations and management class at one of the five
     Hamburger University (H.U.) campuses in the U.S., Germany, England,
     Japan or Australia.  The curriculum at H.U. concentrates on skills and
     practices essential to delivering customer satisfaction and running a
     restaurant business.

     
           The Company's global brand is well-known.  Marketing and
     promotional activities are designed to nurture this brand image and
     differentiate the Company from competitors by focusing on value, taste
     and customer satisfaction.  Funding for promotions is handled at the
     local restaurant level; funding for regional and national efforts is
     handled through advertising cooperatives.  Franchised, Company-
     operated and affiliated restaurants throughout the world make
     voluntary contributions to cooperatives which purchase media.
     Production costs for certain advertising efforts are borne by the
     Company.

          Products

           McDonald's restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu
     consisting of hamburgers and cheeseburgers, including the Big Mac and
     Quarter Pounder with Cheese sandwiches, the Filet-O-Fish, McGrilled
     Chicken and McChicken sandwiches, french fries, Chicken McNuggets,
     salads, shakes, sundaes and cones made with low fat frozen yogurt,
     pies, cookies and a limited number of soft drinks and other beverages.
     In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of products during limited
     promotional time periods. McDonald's restaurants operating in the
     United States are open during breakfast hours and offer a full
     breakfast menu including the Egg McMuffin and the Sausage McMuffin
     with Egg sandwiches, hotcakes and sausage; three varieties of biscuit
     sandwiches; Apple-Bran muffins; and cereals. McDonald's restaurants in
     many countries around the world offer many of these same products as
     well as other products and limited breakfast menus. The Company tests
     new products on an ongoing basis.

           The Company, its franchisees and affiliates purchase food
     products and packaging from numerous independent suppliers.  Quality
     specifications for both raw and cooked food products are established
     and strictly enforced.  Alternative sources of these items are
     generally available.  Quality assurance labs in the U.S., Europe and
     the Pacific work to ensure that the Company's high standards are
     consistently met.  The quality assurance process involves ongoing
     testing and on-site inspections of suppliers' facilities.
     Independently owned and operated distribution centers distribute
     products and supplies to most McDonald's restaurants.  The restaurants
     then prepare, assemble and package these products using specially
     designed production techniques and equipment to obtain uniform
     standards of quality.

          Trademarks and patents

           The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, some
     of which, including "McDonald's", "Ronald McDonald" and other related
     marks, are of material importance to the Company's business. The
     Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while
     valuable, are not material to its business.

          Seasonal operations

           The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to
     any material degree.

     
          Working capital practices

           Information about the Company's working capital practices is
     incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and
     Analysis of the Company's financial position and the consolidated
     statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993
     and 1992 in Part II, item 7, pages 26 through 29, and Part II, item 8
     page 35 of this Form 10-K.

          Customers

           The Company's business is not dependent upon a single customer
     or small group of customers.

          Backlog

           Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.

          Government contracts

           No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation
     of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election
     of the U.S. government.

          Competition

           McDonald's restaurants compete with international, national,
     regional, and local retailers of food products.  The Company competes
     on the basis of price and service and by offering quality food
     products.  The Company's competition in the broadest perspective
     includes restaurants, quick-service eating establishments, pizza
     parlors, coffee shops, street vendors, convenience food stores,
     delicatessens, and supermarket freezers.

           In the U.S., about 378,000 restaurants generate nearly $224
     billion in annual sales.  McDonald's accounts for about 2.6% of those
     restaurants and approximately 6.7% of those sales.  No reasonable
     estimate can be made of the number of competitors outside of the U.S.;
     however, the Company's business in foreign markets continues to grow.

          Research and development

           The Company operates research and development facilities in
     Illinois. While research and development activities are important to
     the Company's business, these expenditures are not material.
     Independent suppliers also conduct research activities for the benefit
     of the McDonald's System, which includes franchisees and suppliers, as
     well as McDonald's, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.

     
          Environmental matters

           The Company is not aware of any federal, state or local
     environmental laws or regulations which will materially affect its
     earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital
     expenditures; however, the Company cannot predict the effect on its
     operations of possible future environmental legislation or
     regulations. During 1994, there were no material capital expenditures
     for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures
     are anticipated.

          Number of employees

           During 1994, the Company's average number of employees
     worldwide was approximately 183,000.

          (d)  Financial information about foreign and domestic operations

           Financial information about foreign and domestic markets is
     incorporated herein by reference from Selected Financial Data,
     Management's Discussion and Analysis and Segment and Geographic
     Information in Part II, item 6, page 10, Part II, item 7, pages 11
     through 29 and Part II, item 8, page 42, respectively, of this Form
     10-K.

     Item 2.   Properties

           The Company identifies and develops sites that offer
     convenience to customers and provide for long-term sales and profit
     potential.  To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and
     walking patterns, census data, school enrollments and other relevant
     data.  The Company's experience and access to advanced technology aids
     in evaluating this information.  In order to control occupancy costs
     and rights, the Company owns restaurant sites and buildings where
     feasible and where it is not practical, secures long-term leases.
     Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is
     important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to lower average
     development costs through construction and design efficiencies,
     standardization and by leveraging the Company's global sourcing
     system.  Additional information about the Company's properties is
     included in Management's Discussion and Analysis and the related
     financial statements with footnotes in Part II, item 7, pages 11
     through 29 and Part II, item 8, pages 34, 35, 37, 39, 43, 48 and 49,
     respectively, of this Form 10-K.

     Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

           The Company has pending a number of lawsuits which have been
     filed from time to time in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover
     a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company's entire business.
     The following is a brief description of the more significant of these
     categories of lawsuits and government regulations.  The Company does
     not believe that any such claims or lawsuits will have a material
     adverse affect on its financial condition or results of operations.

     
          Franchising

           A substantial number of McDonald's restaurants are franchised
     to independent businesspeople operating under arrangements with the
     Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional
     disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a
     broad range of subjects including, without limitation, quality,
     service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or
     terminations of franchises, franchisee claims for additional
     franchises or rewrites of franchises, and delinquent payments.

          Suppliers

           The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply,
     with minor exceptions outside of the United States, food, paper, or
     related items to any McDonald's restaurants. The Company relies upon
     independent suppliers which are required to meet and maintain the
     Company's standards and specifications. There are a number of such
     suppliers worldwide and on occasion disputes arise between the Company
     and its suppliers on a number of issues including, by way of example,
     compliance with product specifications and McDonald's business
     relationship with suppliers.

          Employees

           Thousands of persons are employed by the Company and in
     restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In
     addition, thousands of persons, from time to time, seek employment in
     such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise
     regarding hiring, firing and promotion practices.

          Customers

           McDonald's restaurants serve a large cross-section of the
     public and in the course of serving so many people, disputes arise as
     to products, service, accidents and other matters typical of an
     extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.

          Trademarks

           McDonald's has registered trademarks and service marks, some of
     which are of material importance to the Company's business.  From time
     to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to defend and
     protect its use of such registered marks.

          Government Regulations

           Local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and
     regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business,
     including, but not limited to, franchising, health, environment,
     zoning and employment. The Company does not believe that it is in
     violation of any existing statutory or administrative rules, but it
     cannot predict the effect on its operations from promulgation of
     additional requirements in the future.

     
     Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Shareholders

           None.

     Executive Officers of the Registrant

     estimated to be 537,000.

           Given the Company's returns on equity and assets, the Company's
     management believes it is prudent to reinvest a significant portion of
     earnings back into the business.  The Company has paid 76 consecutive
     quarterly dividends on common stock through March 29, 1995, has
     increased the per share amount 20 times since the first dividend was
     paid in 1976, and has increased the dividend amount every year.
     Additional dividend increases will be considered after reviewing
     returns to shareholders, profitability expectations and financing
     needs.

     SYSTEMWIDE SALES AND RESTAURANTS
     Systemwide sales are comprised of sales by restaurants operated by the
     Company, franchisees and affiliates operating under joint-venture
     agreements between McDonald's and local businesspeople. The 1994
     increase was due to expansion, higher sales at existing restaurants
     and stronger foreign currencies, negatively affected in part by severe
     weather conditions worldwide in early 1994. The 1993 increase was due
     to expansion and higher sales at existing restaurants, offset in part
     by weaker foreign currencies and one less day in 1993 since 1992 was a
     leap year. Sales by Company-operated restaurants grew at a faster rate
     than Systemwide sales in 1994 because Company-operated expansion
     advanced at a faster rate than Systemwide expansion. Sales by Company-
     operated restaurants grew at a slower rate than Systemwide sales in
     1993 because weaker foreign currencies had a greater impact on sales
     by Company-operated restaurants than on Systemwide sales, and because
     of a greater number of franchised restaurants resulting from
     expansion.
       Average sales by restaurants open at least one year (excluding
     satellites) were $1,800,000 in 1994, $32,000 above 1993. Average sales
     in both the U.S. and outside of the U.S. improved through the emphasis
     on value and customer satisfaction.
       Expansion continued at an accelerated pace as 1,212 restaurants
     (excluding satellites) were added in 1994, compared with 900 in 1993
     and 675 in 1992. Restaurants opened during the year (excluding
     satellites) contributed $799 million to Systemwide sales in 1994, $572
     million in 1993 and $478 million in 1992. McDonald's plans to add
     between 1,200 and 1,500 restaurants (excluding satellites) around the
     world in 1995 and in each of the next several years. The mix of net
     additions remains at one-third in the U.S. and two-thirds outside of
     the U.S.
       Our global expansion plan also includes satellites -- foodservice
     facilities that leverage the infrastructure of existing restaurants by
     using their storage capability and inventory, and by drawing on their
     management talent and labor pool. During 1994, 575 satellites were
     added around the world; we expect to open approximately 1,000
     satellites in 1995. The consolidated financial statements reflect the
     operating results of satellites on the same basis as traditional
     restaurants; the results of satellites operated by the Company are
     included in sales by and costs of Company-operated restaurants, while
     those operated by franchisees are included in revenues from and costs
     of franchised restaurants. Satellites in operation contributed $150
     million to Systemwide sales in 1994. The operating results of
     satellites were immaterial to consolidated operating results.

     TOTAL REVENUES
     Total revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants, and
     fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates based
     upon a percent of sales with specified minimum payments. The minimum
     fee is comprised of both a rent and service fee amount at a combined
     rate of approximately 12.5% of sales for new U.S. franchise
     arrangements. Prior to 1994 and since 1987, the minimum fee generally
     was a combined 12.0% for both rent and service fees. Higher fees are
     charged for sites that require a higher investment on the part of the
     Company. Fees paid by franchisees outside of the U.S. vary according

     
     to local business conditions. These fees, together with occupancy and
     operating rights, are stipulated in franchise arrangements that
     generally have 20-year terms, and provide a stable, predictable
     revenue flow to the Company.
       Revenues grow as locations are added and as sales build in existing
     locations. Menu price adjustments affect revenues as well as sales;
     however, due to different pricing structures, new products,
     promotions, and product mix variations among markets, it is
     impractical to quantify the impact of menu price adjustments for the
     System as a whole.
       The rate of increase in total revenues in 1994 was greater than the
     rate of increase in Systemwide sales due to strong global operating
     results and an increase in the Company-operated restaurant base
     through expansion and changes in ownership. The rate of increase in
     total revenues in 1993 was lower than the rate of increase in
     Systemwide sales due to weaker foreign currencies which had a greater
     impact on revenues than on Systemwide sales, and because of a greater
     number of franchised restaurants resulting from expansion.
       Growth rates in sales by Company-operated restaurants and revenues
     from franchised restaurants varied in 1993 because of expansion and
     changes in ownership and because sales by Company-operated restaurants
     were impacted to a greater degree by changing foreign currencies than
     were revenues. In 1994, about 56% of sales by Company-operated
     restaurants and 37% of revenues from franchised restaurants were
     outside of the U.S., compared with 53% and 33%, respectively, in 1993.

     RESTAURANT MARGINS
     Company-operated margins were 19.8% of sales in 1994, compared with
     19.2% in 1993 and 19.1% in 1992. In 1994, as a percent of sales, food
     and paper, and occupancy and other operating costs declined, while
     payroll costs increased. In 1993, as a percent of sales, food and
     paper costs rose, while occupancy, other operating and payroll costs
     declined.
       Franchised margins comprised about two-thirds of the combined
     operating margins. Consolidated franchised margins were 82.8% of
     applicable revenues in 1994, compared with 83.1% in 1993 and 82.8% in
     1992. The 1994 decrease reflected a higher proportion of leased sites
     resulting from accelerated expansion and satellite development, as
     financing costs embedded in operating leases were included in rent
     expense which does not occur if a site is owned.
       Franchised margins include revenues and expenses associated with
     restaurants operating under business facilities lease arrangements.
     Under these arrangements, the Company leases the businesses --
     including equipment -- to franchisees who have options to purchase the
     businesses. While higher fees are charged under these arrangements,
     margins are generally lower because of equipment depreciation. When
     these purchase options are exercised, resulting gains compensate the
     Company for lower margins prior to exercise and are included in other
     operating (income) expense--net. At year-end 1994, 476 restaurants
     were operating under such arrangements, compared with 544 and 583 at
     year-end 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     
     GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND SELLING EXPENSES
     The 1994 increase was primarily due to strategic global investment
     spending to support expansion and value, and a one-time, noncash $15
     million charge related to the early implementation of a new accounting
     rule regarding the timing of expensing advertising production costs.
     The 1993 increase was primarily due to higher employee costs
     associated with expansion and key priorities, partially offset by
     weaker foreign currencies. These expenses as a percent of Systemwide
     sales have remained relatively constant over the past five years, and
     were 4.2% in 1994 and 4.0% in 1993.

     OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE--NET
     This category is comprised of transactions which relate to franchising
     and the foodservice business such as gains on sales of restaurant
     businesses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, and net
     gains or losses from property dispositions. The 1994 income increase
     reflected higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses and higher
     income from affiliates, offset in part by higher losses on property
     dispositions. The 1993 and 1992 amounts were relatively constant,
     reflecting greater income from affiliates and gains on sales of
     restaurant businesses in 1993, and by the favorable settlement of a
     sales tax case in Brazil in 1992.
       Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from
     exercises of purchase options by franchisees operating under business
     facilities lease arrangements and from sales of Company-operated
     restaurants. As a franchisor, McDonald's purchases and sells
     businesses in transactions with franchisees and affiliates in an
     ongoing effort to achieve the optimal ownership mix in each market.
     These transactions and resulting gains are integral to franchising and
     as such, are appropriately recorded in operating income.
       Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is reported after
     interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. partnerships which
     are reported before income taxes. The Company actively participates
     in, but does not control, these businesses.
       Net gains or losses from property dispositions result from
     disposals of excess properties through closings, relocations and other
     transactions.

     OPERATING INCOME
     The 1994 and 1993 increases reflected higher combined operating
     margins, partially offset by higher general, administrative and
     selling expenses. Additionally, 1994 was positively impacted by higher
     other operating income and stronger foreign currencies, while 1993 was
     negatively impacted by weaker foreign currencies.

     INTEREST EXPENSE
     The 1994 decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates,
     partially offset by higher debt levels and stronger foreign
     currencies. The 1993 decrease was primarily due to lower average debt
     balances, lower average interest rates and weaker foreign currencies.

     
     NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE)--NET
     This category includes interest income, gains and losses related to
     investments and financings, as well as miscellaneous income and
     expense. Higher translation losses, principally from Mexico and
     Brazil, losses on investments and higher minority interest charges
     impacted 1994. Also contributing to the year-over-year change were
     gains on debt extinguishments and higher interest income in 1993. The
     1993 increase reflected $9 million in gains related to debt
     extinguishments in 1993 and $29 million in charges related to various
     early redemptions of high-coupon, U.S. Dollar debt in 1992.

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
     The effective tax rate was 35.1% in 1994, compared with 35.4% in 1993
     and 33.8% in 1992. The 1993 increase was primarily the result of new
     U.S. tax legislation enacted that year, which negatively impacted the
     provision by approximately $20 million. Of this amount, nearly $14
     million was attributable to a one-time, noncash revaluation of
     deferred tax liabilities. The Company expects its 1995 effective
     income tax rate to be between 35.0% and 35.5%.
       Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets of
     $233 million in 1994, net of valuation allowance, and $148 million in
     1993. Substantially all of the tax assets arose in the U.S. and other
     profitable markets, the majority of which is expected to be realized
     in future U.S. income tax returns.

     NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
     Net income and net income per common share increased 13% and 16%,
     respectively, in 1994. The spreads between the percent increases in
     net income and net income per common share reflected the impact of
     share repurchase. Net income and net income per common share increased
     13% and 12%, respectively, in 1993. These increases were negatively
     affected by weaker foreign currencies and new U.S. tax legislation.

     

     IMPACT OF CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCIES
     Changing foreign currencies affect reported results. McDonald's
     lessens short-term cash exposures principally by purchasing goods and
     services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and
     hedging foreign-denominated cash flows. In 1994, stronger foreign
     currencies positively contributed to operating income, but their
     impact on interest expense and higher translation losses in Latin
     America more than offset this benefit, resulting in a reduction in net
     income. Weaker foreign currencies had a significant negative impact on
     1993 results. Further discussion of our management of changing foreign
     currencies is on pages 26 through 29 in the commentary on financings
     and total shareholders' equity.

     SALES
     The 1994 and 1993 increases were due to expansion and higher sales at
     existing restaurants. Positive comparable sales were achieved in 1994
     through an emphasis on value and customer satisfaction in the form of
     Extra Value Meals, Happy Meals and the three-tier value program; as
     well as through promotions run during the year in the form of the NBA
     cup highlighting large sandwiches, the Flintstones movie tie-in
     featuring the McRib Grand Poobah Meal and a set of four Bedrock mugs,
     the Dream Team II collector cup, the Music Event offering four artist
     collections with the purchase of a large sandwich or Extra Value Meal,
     and the Holiday Video offering of four videotapes.

     RESTAURANTS
     There were 461 restaurants added in the U.S. in 1994, representing 38%
     of Systemwide additions, compared with 324 and 36% in 1993, and 363
     and 56% five years ago. In addition, 494 U.S. satellites were
     operating at year-end 1994, compared with 114 at year-end 1993.
     McDonald's expects to maintain the current level of U.S. expansion in
     1995 and in each of the next several years by adding between 400 and
     500 restaurants each year, exclusive of satellites.

     1993 and 79% five years ago. During the period 1989 through 1991, the
     Company franchised certain restaurants it previously operated because
     entrepreneurial owners with an equity stake in the business improved
     operations, sales and profits as well as consolidated profits. Since
     1990, we have continued to make operational improvements and reduce
     operating and development costs; as a result, over the past several
     years, our base of restaurants has grown at a faster rate.

     ========================================================================

     U.S. revenues were positively impacted by strong sales and expansion
     in 1994 and 1993, and negatively affected in 1992, 1991 and 1990 by
     the franchising of certain Company-operated restaurant businesses.
       U.S. Company-operated margins increased $42 million or 9% in 1994,
     reflecting sales improvement and growth in the number of Company-
     operated restaurants. These margins were 19.0% of sales in 1994,
     compared with 18.3% in 1993 and 18.4% in 1992. In 1994, the margin
     benefited from lower commodity costs and improvements in processing
     for beef. U.S. franchised margins rose $71 million or 6% in 1994.
     These margins were 83.2% of applicable revenues in 1994, compared with
     83.6% in 1993 and 83.2% in 1992. Franchised margins as a percent of
     revenues decreased in 1994 because rent expense grew at a faster rate
     than revenues, resulting from a higher proportion of leased openings.
       While it is difficult to assess potential effects of federal and
     state legislation in the U.S. that may impact the industry, the
     Company believes it can maintain operating margins within the
     historical range of the past ten years by continuing to build sales
     and reduce costs.

     
     U.S. operating income rose $43 million or 4% in 1994, and was 50% of
     consolidated operating income, compared with 55% in 1993. The 1994 and
     1993 increases resulted primarily from higher combined operating
     margins, partially offset by higher general, administrative and
     selling expenses in the form of higher employee costs, other
     expenditures to support our global strategies and a one-time $12
     million charge related to the implementation of the new accounting
     rule for advertising costs in 1994. Without this charge, U.S.
     operating income would have grown by 5% in 1994. Operating income
     included $366 million of depreciation and amortization in 1994,
     compared with $348 million in 1993 and $330 million in 1992.
       While the U.S. market remains highly competitive, McDonald's is
     confident of continued growth through a greater emphasis on value and
     customer satisfaction, and through expansion.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     U.S. assets increased $297 million or 5% in 1994, driven by higher
     expenditures for restaurant property and buildings resulting from
     expansion. At year-end 1994, 49% of consolidated assets were located
     in the U.S., compared with 53% at year-end 1993. Capital expenditures
     rose $126 million or 22% in 1994, and represented 46% of consolidated
     capital expenditures, compared with 55% five years ago. These amounts
     excluded expenditures made by franchisees such as their initial
     investments in equipment, signs, seating and decor, as well as long-
     term, ongoing reinvestment in their businesses. New restaurant
     expenditures grew $140 million or 42% because of accelerated
     expansion, tempered by lower average development costs, and included
     $41 million related to satellite development.
       Expenditures for existing restaurants included modifications to
     achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction and implementation of
     technology to improve service and food quality. The decline since 1990
     reflected cost reduction efforts and aggressive reinvestment in prior
     years. Rebuilding and relocating restaurants has generated additional
     sales, reflecting our ability to adjust to changing demographics,
     traffic patterns and market opportunities. More than $40 million were
     spent for these investments in 1994, and $249 million over the past
     five years.

     =========================================================================

       Average development costs have steadily decreased since 1990 due to
     efforts to optimize building designs and standardize development.
     Average land costs declined as a result of the increase in low-cost
     building designs, which utilize smaller land parcels. Average building
     costs remained relatively flat reflecting the benefits of these
     building designs and construction efficiencies. Low-cost building
     designs comprised nearly 83% of 1994 openings compared with 80% in
     1993. Average equipment costs decreased due to standardization and
     global sourcing. McDonald's intends to pursue ongoing development cost
     reductions by taking further advantage of standardization, global
     sourcing and economies of scale.
       These lower-cost, lower-volume building designs allow us to
     profitably expand into more locations. This is consistent with
     McDonald's goal of increasing market share with greater marketwide
     presence around the world.
       The Company continues to emphasize restaurant property ownership,
     because real estate ownership yields long-term benefits, including the
     ability to fix occupancy costs. However, most satellites are leased
     locations. In addition to purchasing new properties, the Company
     acquires previously leased properties and owned 69% of U.S. sites at
     year-end 1994, the same as five years ago.

     OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     SALES
     Sales outside of the U.S. rose 18% in 1994 due to expansion, higher
     sales at existing restaurants as comparable sales on a local currency
     basis were positive, and stronger foreign currencies. The 1993
     increase was negatively impacted by weaker foreign currencies, most
     notably the European currencies, as well as the Canadian and
     Australian Dollars. Strong operating results have been achieved in the
     past several years despite weak economies in several countries,
     particularly Canada, England and Japan.

       Although many European economies were weak over the past 18 months,
     McDonald's markets generally performed well.  Throughout 1994,
     comparable sales in France and Germany were not as strong as in prior
     years because of the economy, unusually hot weather in the summer, and
     World Cup Soccer.  Yet, growth and profitability in both markets were
     very good.  Pacific sales were strong with the exception of our joint
     venture in Japan, which has been affected by a weak economy.
     Transaction counts and profits were up in Japan, but sales trends had
     not fundamentally improved.  Business in Canada continued to improve,
     despite a weak economy. Latin American economies have been weak, but
     our business there has been quite good, particularly in Brazil, since
     the mid-year economic reforms.  Results in Mexico in 1994 were
     impacted by the continuing sluggish economy and in December, by the
     devaluation of the Mexican peso. We expect this impact to continue
     into 1995.
       In 1994, many markets delivered excellent sales growth on a local
     currency basis: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
     Canada, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong,
     Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
     Panama, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Scotland, Singapore, South Korea,
     Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Wales.

     RESTAURANTS
     During the past five years, 66% of Systemwide additions have been
     outside of the U.S. Of the 751 restaurants added in 1994, 51% were in
     the six largest markets, compared with 54% in 1993 and 57% in 1992.
     This continued relative decline is indicative of the growing
     importance of emerging markets. McDonald's expects to boost expansion
     outside of the U.S. in 1995 and in each of the next several years by
     adding between 800 and 1,000 restaurants, exclusive of satellites.

     About 68% of franchised restaurants outside of the U.S. were in
     Canada, Germany, Australia, France, Japan and the Netherlands. About
     65% of the restaurants operated by affiliates were located in Japan.

     =======================================================================

       The 1994 and 1993 revenue and operating income increases reflected
     expansion and higher combined operating margins, partially offset by
     higher general, administrative and selling expenses. Changing foreign
     currencies had a positive effect in 1994 and a negative effect in
     1993; higher other operating income helped 1994.
       Company-operated margins remained strong, increasing $114 million or
     21% in 1994. These margins improved to 20.5% of sales in 1994,
     compared with 20.1% in 1993 and 19.8% in 1992. Franchised margins grew
     $151 million or 25% in 1994. These margins were 82.1% of applicable
     revenues in 1994, compared with 82.0% in 1993 and 82.1% in 1992.

     
       The 1994 and 1993 increases in general, administrative and selling
     expenses were primarily due to higher employee costs associated with
     expansion.
       The 1994 increase in other operating income was primarily due to
     gains on sales of restaurant businesses, greater affiliate earnings
     from Japan and other markets, and gains resulting from property
     dispositions. Other operating income decreased in 1993 due to the
     favorable settlement of a sales tax case in Brazil in 1992, offset
     somewhat by 1993 increases in gains on sales of restaurant businesses
     and greater affiliate earnings.
       Operations outside of the U.S. continued to contribute greater
     amounts to consolidated results as shown below:

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment accounted for 63% of revenues
     and 61% of operating income outside of the U.S. in 1994, growing $369
     and $124 million, respectively. Germany, England and France accounted
     for 82% of this segment's operating income, compared with 85% in 1993.
     The 1994 increases were primarily due to strong operating results in
     these countries, as well as many emerging markets. The 1993 increases
     were primarily due to strong operating results in Germany and France,
     as well as many emerging markets, offset by weaker foreign currencies;
     England's operating income was significantly impacted by the weaker
     currency.
       Asia/Pacific revenues grew $236 million and operating income
     increased $52 million in 1994; 87% of operating income was contributed
     by Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The 1994 and 1993 increases
     were attributable to expansion and developing economies in many
     markets, with the exception of our affiliate in Japan which continued
     to suffer from a weak economy. The change in ownership of Taiwan from
     an affiliate to a wholly-owned subsidiary was also a benefit in 1994.

     
       Canadian revenues decreased $12 million in 1994 due to the negative
     impact of the weaker currency; revenues would have increased $21
     million in 1994 if the exchange rate had remained at its 1993 level.
     Operating income increased $6 million because of lower operating costs
     and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, partially offset
     by the weaker currency.
       Latin American revenues grew $95 million, while operating income
     increased $32 million in 1994. The 1994 increases in revenues and
     operating income were primarily a function of expansion, as well as a
     strengthening of the Brazilian market since the mid-year economic
     reforms. However, operating income in Mexico was down because of the
     economy and peso devaluation. The 1993 increase in revenues was
     primarily a function of expansion, while the decrease in operating
     income reflected the favorable settlement of a sales tax case in
     Brazil in 1992, partially offset by better results in Argentina in
     1993. Brazil was also affected by a weak economy in 1993 and 1992.

     ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Assets outside of the U.S. rose $1.3 billion or 22% in 1994 due to
     expansion and stronger foreign currencies. At year-end 1994, about 51%
     of consolidated assets were located outside of the U.S.; 60% of these
     assets were located in England, Germany, France, Australia and Canada.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       In the past five years, nearly $3.9 billion were invested outside
     of the U.S.; in 1994, capital expenditures rose in all geographic
     segments. Approximately 70% of capital expenditures outside of the
     U.S. were invested in Europe -- principally in Germany, France and
     England.
       In general, average development costs for new restaurants for the
     five largest, majority-owned markets -- Australia, Canada, England,
     France and Germany -- were nearly double the U.S. average; such costs
     accommodate higher sales volumes and transaction counts. Since 1991,
     average development costs have decreased due to construction and
     design efficiencies, standardization, global sourcing and changes in
     the mix of openings.
       These lower-cost, lower-volume building designs allow us to
     profitably expand into more locations. This is consistent with
     McDonald's goal of increasing market share with greater marketwide
     presence around the world.

     
       Expenditures for existing restaurants included seating and decor
     upgrades, and equipment required for new products and operating
     efficiencies. The majority of these expenditures were in Europe.
     Expenditures for other properties were principally for office
     facilities.
       As in the U.S., business outside of the U.S. emphasizes restaurant
     property ownership. However, various laws and regulations make
     property acquisition and ownership much more difficult than in the
     U.S. Ownership is obtained when practical; otherwise, long-term leases
     are a viable alternative. In addition, certain markets have laws and
     customs that offer stronger tenancy rights than are available in the
     U.S. The Company and affiliates owned 36% of sites outside of the U.S.
     at year-end 1994, compared with 35% five years ago.
       Capital expenditures made by affiliates -- which were not included
     in consolidated amounts -- were $203 million in 1994, compared with
     $207 million in 1993. The majority of 1994 expenditures were for
     development in Japan, Argentina, Sweden and Singapore.

     
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     FINANCIAL POSITION
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     TOTAL ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Total assets grew approximately $1.6 billion or 13% in 1994; net
     property and equipment represented 83% of total assets and rose $1.2
     billion. Capital expenditures increased $213 million or 16%,
     reflecting higher expansion, partially offset by lower average
     development costs and stronger foreign currencies.

     CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS
     Cash provided by operations increased $246 million or 15% in 1994.
     Together with other sources of cash such as borrowings, cash provided
     by operations was used principally for capital expenditures, debt
     repayments, share repurchase and dividends. For the fourth straight
     year, cash provided by operations exceeded capital expenditures.
       While cash generated is significant relative to cash required, the
     Company also has the ability to meet short-term needs through
     commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.
     Accordingly, a relatively low current ratio has been purposefully
     maintained; it was .30 at year-end 1994.
       The Company believes that cash flow measures are meaningful
     indicators of growth and financial strength, when evaluated in the
     context of absolute dollars, uses and consistency. Over the past five
     years, cash flow coverage has improved significantly. Cash provided by
     operations is expected to cover capital expenditures over the next
     several years, even as expansion continues to accelerate.

     FINANCINGS
     The Company strives to minimize interest expense and the impact of
     changing foreign currencies while maintaining the capacity to meet
     increasing growth requirements. To accomplish these objectives,
     McDonald's generally finances long-term assets with long-term debt in
     the currencies in which the assets are denominated, while remaining
     flexible to take advantage of changing foreign currencies and interest
     rates.

     
       Over the years, major capital markets and various techniques have
     been utilized to meet financing requirements and reduce interest
     expense. Currency exchange agreements have been employed in
     conjunction with borrowings to obtain desired currencies at attractive
     rates. Interest-rate exchange agreements have been used to effectively
     convert fixed-rate to floating-rate debt, or vice versa. Foreign-
     denominated debt has been used to lessen the impact of changing
     foreign currencies on net income and shareholders' equity. Total
     foreign-denominated debt, including the effects of currency exchange
     agreements, was $4.0 and $3.1 billion at year-end 1994 and 1993,
     respectively.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Company manages its debt portfolio in order to respond to
     changes in interest rates and foreign currencies and accordingly,
     periodically retires, redeems, and repurchases debt; terminates
     exchange agreements; and uses derivatives. While changing foreign
     currencies affect reported results, the Company actively hedges seven
     foreign currencies -- Japanese Yen, Deutsche Mark, French Franc,
     British Pound Sterling, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar and Swiss
     Franc -- to minimize the cash exposure of royalty and other payments
     received in the U.S. in local currencies.

     
          The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity
     or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not
     hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes; all exchange
     agreements are over-the-counter instruments. McDonald's restaurants
     also primarily purchase goods and services in local currencies
     resulting in natural hedges. McDonald's typically finances in local
     currencies creating economic hedges; and the Company's exposure is
     diversified within a basket of currencies, as opposed to one or
     several. The Company's largest net asset exposures (defined as total
     assets less foreign-denominated liabilities) by foreign currency were
     as follows:

     Austrian Schillings                                       84        63
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------


       Moody's and Standard & Poor's have rated McDonald's debt Aa2 and
     AA, respectively, since 1982. Duff & Phelps began rating the debt in
     1990, and currently rates it AA+. At the present time, these strong
     ratings are important to us in the context of our global development
     plans. The Company has not experienced, nor does it expect to
     experience, difficulty in obtaining financing or in refinancing
     existing debt. At year-end 1994, the Company and its subsidiaries had
     $1.7 billion available under line of credit agreements and $585
     million under previously filed shelf registrations available for
     future debt issuance.
       Although McDonald's prefers to own real estate, leases are an
     alternative financing method. As in the past, some new properties will
     be leased. Such leases frequently include renewal and/or purchase
     options. In the past five years, McDonald's has leased properties
     related to 40% of U.S. openings (excluding satellites) and 64% of
     openings outside of the U.S. (excluding satellites).
       Since 1990, the Company has improved its balance sheet by reducing
     leverage while simultaneously increasing expansion and repurchasing
     shares.

     TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
     Total shareholders' equity rose $611 million or 10% in 1994,
     representing 51% of total assets at year-end 1994. One technique used
     to enhance common shareholder value is to repurchase shares with our
     excess cash flow or debt capacity, while maintaining a strong equity
     base for future expansion. At year-end 1994, the market value of
     shares repurchased and recorded as common stock in treasury was
     $4.0 billion, compared to their cost of $2.4 billion.

     
       In conjunction with efforts to enhance common shareholder value,
     the Company repurchased about $500 million of its common stock in
     1994, representing half of the three-year $1.0 billion program
     announced in January 1994. In 1993, the Company completed a $700
     million common share repurchase program begun in 1992. In 1992, in
     order to lower the cost of equity capital, the Company issued $500
     million of Series E 7.72% Cumulative Preferred Stock; at the same
     time, the Board of Directors authorized a $500 million common share
     repurchase program. Subsequently, the Board authorized an additional
     $200 million expenditure for share repurchase in 1993.
       Stronger foreign currencies added $77 million to shareholders'
     equity in 1994. At year-end 1994, foreign-denominated assets not
     entirely financed with related foreign-denominated debt were
     principally located in England, Canada, Australia, France and Austria.
     At year-end 1994, assets in hyperinflationary markets and in Mexico
     were principally financed in U.S. Dollars.

     RETURNS
     Return on average assets is computed using operating income. Net
     income, less preferred stock dividends (net of tax in 1994, 1993 and
     1992), is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end
     balances are used to compute both average assets and average common
     equity.


     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    1994    1993     1992     1991     1990
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Return on average assets       17.6    17.0     16.4     15.7     16.3

       equity                       19.4    19.0     18.2     19.1     20.7
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The improvements in return on average assets since 1991 reflected
     better global operating results and a slower rate of asset growth. The
     1994 and 1993 improvements in return on average common equity
     reflected higher levels of share repurchase, whereas declines in 1992
     and 1991 resulted from lower levels of share repurchase as excess cash
     flow was used to reduce debt.

     EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES--INFLATION
     McDonald's has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost
     increases effectively. Rapid inventory turnover, ability to adjust
     prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings -- many of
     which are at fixed costs and partially financed by debt made cheaper
     by inflation -- have enabled McDonald's to mitigate the effects of
     inflation. In hyperinflationary markets, menu board prices typically
     are adjusted to keep pace, thereby mitigating the effect on reported
     results.

     MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

     Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair
     presentation of the consolidated financial statements and Financial
     Comments appearing in this annual report. The financial statements
     were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
     principles and include certain amounts based on management's judgment
     and best estimates. Other financial information presented in the
     annual report is consistent with the financial statements.
       The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
     reporting including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized
     acquisition, use or disposition, which is designed to provide
     reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of
     Directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial
     statements and such asset safeguarding. The system includes a
     documented organizational structure and appropriate division of
     responsibilities; established policies and procedures which are
     communicated throughout the Company; careful selection, training, and
     development of our people; and utilization of an internal audit
     program. Policies and procedures prescribe that the Company and all
     employees are to maintain the highest ethical standards and that
     business practices throughout the world are to be conducted in a
     manner which is above reproach.
       There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system
     of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the
     circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an
     effective internal control system can provide only reasonable
     assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
     safeguarding of assets. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal
     control system can change with circumstances. The Company believes
     that at December 31, 1994, it maintained an effective system of
     internal control over financial reporting and safeguarding of assets
     against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition.
       The consolidated financial statements have been audited by
     independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, who were given unrestricted
     access to all financial records and related data. The audit report of
     Ernst & Young LLP is presented herein.
       The Board of Directors, operating through its Audit Committee
     composed entirely of outside Directors, provides oversight to the
     financial reporting process. Ernst & Young LLP has independent access
     to the Audit Committee and periodically meets with the Committee to
     discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     The Board of Directors and Shareholders
     McDonald's Corporation
     Oak Brook, Illinois

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
     McDonald's Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and
     1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
     equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
     December 31, 1994. These financial statements are the responsibility
     of McDonald's Corporation management. Our responsibility is to express
     an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
       We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
     auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
     the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
     statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
     disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
     assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
     made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
     reasonable basis for our opinion.
       In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
     fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
     of McDonald's Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and
     1993, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
     flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
     1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

The accompanying Financial Comments are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
/TABLE


     
     MCDONALD'S CORPORATION FINANCIAL COMMENTS

     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
     Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in 50% or less owned
     affiliates are carried at equity in the companies' net assets.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
     The functional currency of each operation outside of the U.S. is the
     respective local currency, except for hyperinflationary countries
     where it is the U.S. Dollar.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
     Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and
     amortization provided on the straight-line method over the following
     estimated useful lives: buildings--up to 40 years; leasehold
     improvements--lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms
     including option periods; and equipment--3 to 12 years.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS
     Intangible assets consist primarily of franchise rights reacquired
     from franchisees and affiliates, and are amortized on the straight-
     line method over an average life of 30 years.

     ADVERTISING COSTS
     In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company adopted the American
     Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position 93-7,
     Reporting on Advertising Costs. Under its provisions, the Company
     expenses production costs of radio and television ads as of the date
     the commercials are initially aired. As a result, the Company recorded
     a one-time, noncash $15.0 million charge to general, administrative
     and selling expenses in the fourth quarter. Advertising expenses
     included in costs of Company-operated restaurants and general,
     administrative and selling expenses were (in millions): 1994--$385.6;
     1993--$353.8; 1992--$355.7.

     
     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     The Company utilizes derivatives in managing risk, but not for trading
     purposes. Non-U.S. Dollar financing transactions generally are
     effective as hedges of long-term investments or intercompany loans in
     the corresponding currency. Foreign currency gains and losses on the
     hedges of long-term investments are recorded as foreign currency
     translation adjustment included in shareholders' equity. Gains and
     losses related to hedges of intercompany loans offset the gains and
     losses on intercompany loans and are recorded in nonoperating income
     (expense). Interest-rate exchange agreements are designated and
     effective to modify the Company's interest-rate exposures. Net
     interest is accrued as either interest receivable or payable with the
     offset recorded in interest expense. The Company also uses short-term
     forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge future foreign-denominated
     royalty cash flows and other payments received in the U.S. from
     foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Gains and losses associated with
     these contracts are deferred and amortized over the twelve-month
     period being hedged.
       The carrying amounts for cash and equivalents and notes receivable
     approximated fair value. For noninterest-bearing security deposits by
     franchisees, no fair value was provided as these deposits are an
     integral part of the overall franchise arrangements.

     STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
     The Company considers all highly liquid investments with short-term
     maturity dates to be cash equivalents. The impact of changing foreign
     currencies on cash and equivalents was not material.

     ======================================================================

     Franchisees operating under business facilities lease arrangements
     have options to purchase the businesses. The results of operations of
     restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with
     franchisees and affiliates were not material to the consolidated
     financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale. In 1994,
     due to increased ownership, the Company consolidated affiliates in
     Taiwan, South Korea, Turkey and China, which increased total assets
     and liabilities by approximately $205.0 million.

       Satellite foodservice facilities are points of distribution which
     leverage the infrastructure of existing restaurants by using their
     storage capability and inventory, and by drawing on their management

       Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been provided on basis differences
     related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.
     These basis differences were approximately $675.0 million at December
     31, 1994, and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings which are
     considered to be permanently invested in the businesses. If these
     earnings were not considered permanently invested, no additional taxes
     would be provided due to the overall higher tax rates in markets outside
     of the U.S. and the ability to recover withholding taxes as foreign tax
     credits in the U.S.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     DEBT FINANCING
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS
     The Company has a line of credit agreement for $700.0 million, which
     remained unused at December 31, 1994, and which may be renewed on an
     annual basis unless the participating banks notify the Company four
     days prior to the renewal period. Prior to July 20, 1994, the
     agreement could not be terminated without 18 months notice and
     supported the classification of certain notes maturing within one year
     as long-term debt. Each borrowing under the current agreement bears
     interest at one of several specified floating rates to be selected by
     the Company at the time of borrowing. The agreement provides for fees
     of .07% per annum on the unused portion of the commitment. In
     addition, certain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. had unused lines of
     credit totaling $1.0 billion at December 31, 1994; these were
     principally short-term and denominated in various currencies at local
     market rates of interest. The weighted average interest rates of
     short-term borrowings, comprised of commercial paper and foreign-
     denominated bank line borrowings, were 6.8% and 8.1% at December 31,
     1994, and 1993, respectively.

     
     EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS
     The Company has entered into agreements for the exchange of various
     currencies, certain of which also provide for the periodic exchange of
     interest payments. These agreements, as well as additional interest-
     rate exchange agreements, expire through 2003. The interest-rate
     exchange agreements had a notional amount with a U.S. Dollar
     equivalent of $1.3 billion at December 31, 1994, and were denominated
     primarily in U.S. Dollars, British Pounds Sterling, French Francs,
     Deutsche Marks and Japanese Yen. The net value of each exchange
     agreement was classified as an asset or liability based on its
     carrying amount, and any related interest income was netted against
     interest expense.
       The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group
     of financial institutions. The Company continually monitors its
     positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties, and adjusts
     positions as appropriate. The Company does not have a significant
     exposure to any individual counterparty, and has entered into master
     agreements that contain netting arrangements.
       The Company also had short-term forward foreign exchange contracts
     outstanding at December 31, 1994, with a U.S. Dollar equivalent of
     $65.2 million in various currencies, primarily payable in French
     Francs, Deutsche Marks, British Pounds Sterling and Japanese Yen. The
     deferred loss related to the short-term hedging program was $1.7
     million at December 31, 1994.

     GUARANTEES
     Included in total debt at December 31, 1994, were $159.5 million of
     7.5% ESOP Notes Series A and $83.3 million of 7.2% ESOP Notes Series B
     issued by the Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (LESOP), with
     payments through 2004 and 2006, respectively, which are guaranteed by
     the Company. Interest rates on the notes were adjusted in 1994 due to
     refinancing of certain sinking fund payments. The Company has agreed
     to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of certain events.
       The Company also has guaranteed certain foreign affiliate loans
     totaling $66.9 million at December 31, 1994. The Company also was a
     general partner in 70 domestic partnerships with total assets of
     $287.0 million and total liabilities of $141.3 million at December 31,
     1994.

     ======================================================================

     The carrying amounts for short-term forward foreign exchange contracts
     approximated fair value at December 31, 1994. The fair value of the
     debt obligations (excluding capital leases) and of the currency and
     interest-rate exchange agreements was estimated using quoted market
     prices, various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses. The
     Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its
     debt prior to maturity. Given the market value of its common stock and
     its significant real estate holdings, the Company believes that the
     fair value of total assets was higher than their carrying value at
     December 31, 1994.

     DEBT OBLIGATIONS
     The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through various
     public and private offerings and bank loans. The terms of most debt
     obligations contain restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages
     and long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements,
     the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at
     par or at a premium over par. The following table summarizes these
     debt obligations, including the gross effects of currency and
     interest-rate exchange agreements:

     Sterling of 5.91% Series A Preferred Stock in 1993. Unless redeemed at
     the Company's option, each series of preferred stock must be redeemed
     five years from the date of issuance. These combined preferred
     interests were valued at U.S. $117.4 million at December 31, 1994.
     Also, another subsidiary issued additional preferred stock in 1994 and
     1993. All of the preferred stock of this subsidiary has a dividend
     rate adjusted annually (7.5% at December 31, 1994) and is redeemable
     at the option of the holder at a current redemption price totaling
     $45.0 million. Each of these issues was reflected in preferred
     interests in consolidated subsidiaries.
       Included in other was the $100.00 per share redemption value of
     181,868 shares of 5% Series D Preferred Stock. This stock, which
     carries one vote per share, must be redeemed on the occurrence of
     specified events.

     LEASING ARRANGEMENTS
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     At December 31, 1994, the Company was lessee at 2,553 locations under
     ground leases (the Company leases land and constructs and owns
     buildings) and at 3,268 locations under improved leases (lessor owns
     land and buildings). Land and building lease terms for most
     traditional restaurants are generally for 20 to 25 years and, in many
     cases, provide for rent escalations and one or more five-year renewal
     options with certain leases providing purchase options. Most
     satellites operate under improved leases which are generally of a
     shorter term and include primarily percentage rent payments only. For
     most locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy
     costs which include property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In
     addition, the Company is lessee under noncancelable leases covering
     offices and vehicles.
       Future minimum payments required under operating leases with
     initial terms of one year or more after December 31, 1994, are:

     FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENTS

     Franchise arrangements, with franchisees who operate throughout the
     U.S. and in most countries around the world, generally provide for
     initial fees and continuing payments to the Company based upon a
     percentage of sales, with minimum rent payments. Among other things,
     franchisees are provided the use of restaurant facilities, generally
     for a period of 20 years. They are required to pay related occupancy
     costs which include property taxes, insurance, maintenance and a
     refundable, noninterest-bearing security deposit. On a limited basis,
     the Company accepts notes from franchisees, which generally are
     secured by interests in restaurant equipment and franchises.

     billion.

     
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company has a program for U.S. employees which includes profit
     sharing, 401(k) (McDESOP), and leveraged employee stock ownership
     features. Profit sharing assets can be invested in McDonald's common
     stock or among several other investment alternatives. McDESOP allows
     employees to invest in McDonald's common stock by making contributions
     which are partially matched by the Company. LESOP is invested in both
     McDonald's convertible preferred and common stock.
       Staff, executives and restaurant managers share in profit sharing
     contributions; shares are released under the LESOP based on
     participants' compensation. The profit sharing contribution is
     discretionary, and the amount is determined by the Company each year.
     The LESOP contribution is based on the loan payments necessary to
     amortize the debt initially incurred to acquire the convertible
     preferred stock, some of which has been converted to common stock.
     Shares held by the LESOP are allocated to participants as the loan is
     repaid. Dividends on shares held by the LESOP are used to service the
     debt, and shares are released to participants in order to replace the
     dividends on shares that have been allocated to them.
       LESOP costs shown in the following table were based upon the cash
     paid for loan payments less these dividends.

       Assuming conversion of the preferred stock to common stock, at
     December 31, 1994, 4.4 million and 10.7 million shares would have been
     allocated and unallocated, respectively; no shares were committed to
     be released.
       Certain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. also offer profit sharing,
     stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs
     outside of the U.S. were (in millions): 1994--$15.7; 1993--$13.0;
     1992--$14.0.
       The Company does not provide any other postretirement benefits, and
     postemployment benefits were immaterial.

     
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     STOCK OPTIONS
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Under the 1992 Stock Ownership Incentive and the 1975 Stock Ownership
     Option Plans, options to purchase common stock are granted at prices
     not less than fair market value of the stock on date of grant.
     Substantially all of these options become exercisable in four equal
     biennial installments, commencing one year from date of grant, and
     expiring ten years from date of grant. At December 31, 1994, 79.0
     million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under both
     plans.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

       During the past several years, the Financial Accounting Standards
     Board has been considering the appropriate accounting for stock
     options, and in December 1994, decided to work towards improving
     disclosures about stock-based awards. Pending the resolution of this
     issue, the following table provides additional information regarding
     the Company's option program. The Company surveyed its institutional
     investors regarding the appropriate disclosures for stock-based
     awards, and the content contained herein reflects the information
     which they considered to be of value.
       The potential dilution of common shares outstanding upon exercise
     of stock options represents the number of common shares issuable upon
     exercise less the number of common shares that could be repurchased
     with proceeds from the exercise based upon the respective December 31
     prices of the Company's common stock. As such, this potential dilution
     was 1.6%, 1.8% and 1.7% at year-end 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
     Options outstanding at December 31, 1994, had an average life of 7.4
     years if held to their expiration date; options are generally
     exercised prior to their expiration date.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

       As shown above, the average option exercise price has consistently
     exceeded the average cost of treasury stock issued for option
     exercises because of the Company's practice of prefunding the program
     through share repurchase. As a result, stock option exercises have
     generated additional capital, as cash received from employees has
     exceeded the Company's average acquisition cost of treasury stock.
       Options granted during each year were 1.9%, 1.7% and 1.6% of
     average common shares outstanding for 1994, 1993 and 1992,
     respectively. Stock options were granted to approximately 6,600, 5,800
     and 5,700 employees in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Shares are
     issued from treasury stock to employees upon exercise of stock
     options.

     
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     CAPITAL STOCK
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     STOCK SPLITS
     On May 27, 1994, the Board of Directors approved two-for-one stock
     splits to be effected in the form of stock dividends to be distributed
     on June 24, 1994, to common and Series B and C Preferred shareholders
     of record as of June 7, 1994. All common and Series B and C ESOP
     Convertible Preferred Stock information appearing in the accompanying
     consolidated financial statements and Financial Comments has been
     restated to give retroactive effect to the stock splits, including the
     transfer of an appropriate amount to common stock from additional
     paid-in capital.

     PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION
     Income used in the computation of per common share information was
     reduced by preferred stock cash dividends (net of tax) and divided by
     the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during each
     year (in millions): 1994--701.8; 1993--711.8; 1992--726.5. The effect
     of potentially dilutive securities was not material.

     PREFERRED STOCK
     In December 1992, the Company issued $500.0 million of Series E 7.72%
     Cumulative Preferred Stock; 10,000 preferred shares are equivalent to
     20.0 million depositary shares having a liquidation preference of
     $25.00 per depositary share. Each preferred share is entitled to one
     vote under certain circumstances and is redeemable at the option of
     the Company beginning on December 3, 1997, at its liquidation
     preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
       In September 1989 and April 1991, the Company sold $200.0 million
     of Series B and $100.0 million of Series C ESOP Convertible Preferred
     Stock to the LESOP. The LESOP financed the purchase by issuing notes
     which are guaranteed by the Company and are included in long-term
     debt, with an offsetting reduction in shareholders' equity. Each
     preferred share has a liquidation preference of $14.375 and $16.5625,
     respectively, and is convertible into a minimum of .7692 and .8 common
     share (conversion rate), respectively. Upon termination of employment,
     employees are guaranteed a minimum value payable in common shares
     equal to the greater of the conversion rate; the fair market value of
     their preferred shares; or the liquidation preference plus accrued
     dividends, not to exceed one common share. Each preferred share is
     entitled to one vote and currently is redeemable at the option of the
     Company. In 1992, 8.2 million Series B shares were converted into 6.4
     million common shares.

     
     COMMON EQUITY PUT OPTIONS
     In June 1994, the Company sold 2.0 million common equity put options
     which were exercised in November 1994. During November and December
     1994, the Company sold an additional 2.0 million common equity put
     options which expired unexercised in the first quarter of 1995. At
     December 31, 1994, the $56.2 million exercise price of these options
     was classified in common equity put options, and the related offset
     was recorded in common stock in treasury, net of premiums received.
         In April 1993, the Company sold 1.0 million common equity put
     options which expired unexercised in July 1993. In December 1992, the
     Company sold 2.0 million common equity put options which expired
     unexercised in April 1993. At December 31, 1992, the $94.0 million
     exercise price of these options was classified in common equity put
     options and the related offset was recorded in common stock in
     treasury, net of premiums received.

     SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
     In December 1988, the Company declared a dividend of one Preferred
     Share Purchase Right (Right) on each outstanding share of common
     stock. Under certain conditions, each Right may be exercised to
     purchase one four-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
     Participating Preferred Stock (the economic equivalent of one common
     share) at an exercise price of $62.50 (which may be adjusted under
     certain circumstances), and is transferable apart from the common
     stock ten days following a public announcement that a person or group
     has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
     common shares (which threshold may be reduced by the Board of
     Directors to as low as 10%), or ten business days following the
     commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender or
     exchange offer resulting in beneficial ownership by a person or group
     exceeding the threshold.
       Once the threshold has been exceeded, or if the Company is acquired
     in a merger or other business combination transaction, each Right will
     entitle the holder, other than such person or group, to purchase at
     the then current exercise price, stock of the Company or the acquiring
     company having a market value of twice the exercise price.
       Each Right is nonvoting and expires on December 28, 1998, unless
     redeemed by the Company, at a price of $.0025, at any time prior to
     the public announcement that a person or group has exceeded the
     threshold. At December 31, 1994, 2.1 million shares of the Series A
     Junior Participating Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance under
     this plan.
