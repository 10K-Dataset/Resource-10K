                                     PART I

     Item 1.   Business

          McDonald's Corporation, the registrant, together with its
     subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the "Company".

          (a)  General development of business

           There have been no significant changes to the Company's
     corporate structure during 1993, nor material changes in the Company's
     method of conducting business.

          (b)  Financial information about industry segments

           Industry segment data for the years ended December 31, 1993,
     1992 and 1991 is included in Part II, item 8, pages 33 and 41 of this
     Form 10-K.

          (c)  Narrative description of business

          General

           The Company develops, operates, franchises and services a
     worldwide system of restaurants which prepare, assemble, package and
     sell a limited menu of value-priced foods. These restaurants are
     operated by the Company or, under the terms of franchise arrangements,
     by franchisees who are independent third parties, or by affiliates
     operating under joint-venture agreements between the Company and local
     businesspeople.

           The Company's franchising program assures consistency and
     quality.  The Company is selective in granting franchises and is not
     in the practice of franchising to investor groups or passive
     investors.  Under the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees
     supply capital - initially, by purchasing equipment, signs, seating,
     and decor, and over the long term, by reinvesting in the business.
     The Company shares the investment by owning or leasing the land and
     building; franchisees then contribute to the Company's revenues
     through payment of rent and service fees based upon a percent of
     sales, with specified minimum payments.  Generally, the conventional
     franchise arrangement lasts 20 years and franchising practices are
     consistent throughout the world.  Further discussion regarding site
     selection is included in Part 1, item 2, page 6 of this Form 10-K.

           Training begins at the restaurant with one-on-one instruction
     and videotapes.  Aspiring restaurant managers progress through a
     development program of classes in basic and intermediate operations,
     management and equipment.  Assistant managers are eligible to attend
     the advanced operations and management class at one of the five
     Hamburger University (H.U.) campuses in the U.S., Germany, England,
     Japan or Australia.  The curriculum at H.U. concentrates on skills and
     practices essential to delivering customer satisfaction and running a
     restaurant business.


     
           The Company's global brand is well-known.  Marketing and
     promotional activities are designed to nurture this brand image and
     differentiate the Company from competitors by focusing on value and
     customer satisfaction.  Funding for promotions is handled at the local
     restaurant level; funding for regional and national efforts is handled
     through advertising cooperatives.  Franchised, Company-operated and
     affiliated restaurants throughout the world make voluntary
     contributions to cooperatives which purchase media.  Production costs
     for certain advertising efforts are borne by the Company.

          Products

           McDonald's restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu
     consisting of hamburgers and cheeseburgers, including the Big Mac and
     Quarter Pounder with Cheese sandwiches, the Filet-O-Fish, McGrilled
     Chicken and McChicken sandwiches, french fries, Chicken McNuggets,
     salads, low fat shakes, sundaes and cones made with low fat frozen
     yogurt, pies, cookies and a limited number of soft drinks and other
     beverages. In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of products
     during limited promotional time periods. McDonald's restaurants
     operating in the United States are open during breakfast hours and
     offer a full breakfast menu including the Egg McMuffin and the Sausage
     McMuffin with Egg sandwiches, hotcakes and sausage; three varieties of
     biscuit sandwiches; Apple-Bran muffins; and cereals. McDonald's
     restaurants in many countries around the world offer many of these
     same products as well as other products and limited breakfast menus.
     The Company tests new products on an ongoing basis.

           The Company, its franchisees and affiliates purchase food
     products and packaging from numerous independent suppliers.  Quality
     specifications for both raw and cooked food products are established
     and strictly enforced.  Alternative sources of these items are
     generally available.  Quality assurance labs in the U.S., Europe and
     the Pacific work to ensure that the Company's high standards are
     consistently met.  The quality assurance process involves ongoing
     testing and on-site inspections of suppliers' facilities.
     Independently owned and operated distribution centers distribute
     products and supplies to most McDonald's restaurants.  The restaurants
     then prepare, assemble and package these products using specially
     designed production techniques and equipment to obtain uniform
     standards of quality.

          Trademarks and patents

           The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, some
     of which, including "McDonald's", "Ronald McDonald" and other related
     marks, are of material importance to the Company's business. The
     Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while
     valuable, are not material to its business.

          Seasonal operations

           The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to
     any material degree.


     
          Working capital practices

           Information about the Company's working capital practices is
     incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and
     Analysis of the Company's financial position and the consolidated
     statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992
     and 1991 in Part II, item 7, pages 26 through 28, and Part II, item 8
     page 35 of this Form 10-K.

          Customers

           The Company's business is not dependent upon a single customer
     or small group of customers.

          Backlog

           Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.

          Government contracts

           No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation
     of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election
     of the U.S. government.

          Competition

           McDonald's restaurants compete with international, national,
     regional, and local retailers of food products.  The Company competes
     on the basis of price and service and by offering quality food
     products.  The Company's competition in the broadest perspective
     includes restaurants, quick-service eating establishments, pizza
     parlors, coffee shops, street vendors, convenience food stores,
     delicatessens, and supermarket freezers.

           In the U.S., about 372,000 restaurants generate nearly $213
     billion in annual sales.  McDonald's accounts for about 2.5% of those
     restaurants and approximately 6.7% of those sales.  No reasonable
     estimate can be made of the number of competitors outside of the U.S.;
     however, the Company's business in foreign markets continues to grow.

          Research and development

           The Company operates research and development facilities in
     Illinois. While research and development activities are important to
     the Company's business, these expenditures are not material.
     Independent suppliers also conduct research activities for the benefit
     of the McDonald's System, which includes franchisees and suppliers, as
     well as McDonald's, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.


     
          Environmental matters

           The Company is not aware of any federal, state or local
     environmental laws or regulations which will materially affect its
     earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital
     expenditures; however, the Company cannot predict the effect on its
     operations of possible future environmental legislation or
     regulations. During 1993, there were no material capital expenditures
     for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures
     are anticipated.

          Number of employees

           During 1993, the Company's average number of employees was
     approximately 167,000.

          (d)  Financial information about foreign and domestic operations

           Financial information about foreign and domestic markets is
     incorporated herein by reference from selected Financial Data,
     Management's Discussion and Analysis and Segment and Geographic
     Information in Part II, item 6, page 10, Part II, item 7, pages 11
     through 29 and Part II, item 8, page 41, respectively, of this Form
     10-K.

     Item 2.   Properties

           The Company identifies and develops sites that offer
     convenience to customers and provide for long-term sales and profit
     potential.  To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and
     walking patterns, census data, school enrollments and other relevant
     data.  The Company's experience and access to advanced technology aids
     in evaluating this information.  In order to control occupancy costs
     and rights, the Company owns restaurant sites and buildings where
     feasible and where it is not practical, secures long-term leases.
     Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is
     important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to lower average
     development costs through construction and design efficiencies and by
     leveraging the Company's global sourcing system.  Additional
     information about the Company's properties is incorporated herein by
     reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis and the related
     financial statements with footnotes in Part II, item 7, pages 11
     through 29 and Part II, item 8, pages 34, 35, 37, 38, 42, 46 and 47,
     respectively, of this Form 10-K.

     Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

           The Company has pending a number of lawsuits which have been
     filed from time to time in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover
     a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company's entire business.
     The following is a brief description of the more significant of these
     categories of lawsuits and government regulations.


     
          Franchising

           A substantial number of McDonald's restaurants are franchised
     to independent businesspeople operating under arrangements with the
     Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional
     disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a
     broad range of subjects including, without limitation, quality,
     service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or
     terminations of franchises, franchisee claims for additional
     franchises or rewrites of franchises, and delinquent payments.

          Suppliers

           The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply,
     with minor exceptions outside of the United States, food, paper, or
     related items to any McDonald's restaurants. The Company relies upon
     independent suppliers which are required to meet and maintain the
     Company's standards and specifications. There are a number of such
     suppliers worldwide and on occasion disputes arise between the Company
     and its suppliers on a number of issues including, by way of example,
     compliance with product specifications and McDonald's business
     relationship with suppliers.

          Employees

           Thousands of persons are employed by the Company and in
     restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In
     addition, thousands of persons, from time to time, seek employment in
     such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise
     regarding hiring, firing and promotion practices.

          Customers

           McDonald's restaurants serve a large cross-section of the
     public and in the course of serving so many people, disputes arise as
     to products, service, accidents and other matters typical of an
     extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.

          Trademarks

           McDonald's has registered trademarks and service marks, some of
     which are of material importance to the Company's business.  From time
     to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to defend and
     protect its use of such registered marks.

          Government Regulations

           Local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and
     regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business,
     including, but not limited to, franchising, health, environment,
     zoning and employment. The Company does not believe that it is in
     violation of any existing statutory or administrative rules, but it
     cannot predict the effect on its operations from promulgation of
     additional requirements in the future.

     Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Shareholders
           None.


     
     Executive Officers of the Registrant

           All of the executive officers of McDonald's Corporation as of
     March 1, 1994 are shown below. Each of the executive officers has been
     continuously employed by the Company for at least five years and has a
     term of office until the May 1994 Board of Directors' meeting.

     


     
                                       PART II

     Item 5.   Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related
               Shareholder Matters

           The Company's common stock trades under the symbol MCD and is
     listed on the following stock exchanges in the United States:  New
     York, Chicago and Pacific.

           The common stock price range on the New York Stock Exchange
     composite tape has been as follows:

          ---------------------------------------------------------
          Quarter                1993                     1992

          ---------------------------------------------------------

           The approximate number of shareholders of record and beneficial
     owners of the Company's common stock as of December 31, 1993 was
     estimated to be 459,000.

           Given the Company's returns on equity and assets, the Company's
     management believes it is prudent to reinvest a significant portion of
     earnings back into the business.  The Company has paid 72 consecutive
     quarterly dividends on common stock and has increased the per share
     amount 19 times since the first dividend was paid in 1976.  Additional
     dividend increases will be considered after reviewing returns to
     shareholders, profitability expectations and financing needs.

           Dividends per common share for the years ended December 31,
     1993 and 1992 are incorporated herein by reference from Part II,
     item 8, page 33.

     SYSTEMWIDE SALES AND RESTAURANTS
     Systemwide sales are comprised of sales by restaurants operated by the
     Company, franchisees and affiliates operating under joint-venture
     agreements between McDonald's and local businesspeople.  The 1993
     increase was due to new restaurant expansion and higher sales at
     existing restaurants worldwide, offset in part by weaker foreign
     currencies and one less day in 1993 since 1992 was a leap year.  The
     1992 increase was due to new restaurant expansion, higher sales at
     existing restaurants and stronger foreign currencies.  Sales by
     Company-operated restaurants grew at a slower rate than Systemwide
     sales in 1993 and 1992.  The slower rate of growth in 1993 occurred
     primarily because weaker foreign currencies had a greater impact on
     sales by Company-operated restaurants than on Systemwide sales,
     combined with an increasing global base of franchised restaurants from
     expansion.  The slower rate of growth in 1992 reflected the
     franchising of certain Company-operated businesses.
       Average sales by restaurants open at least one year were $1,768,000
     in 1993, which was $35,000 higher than in 1992.  Average sales both in
     the U.S. and outside of the U.S. improved due to the value program and
     various promotional efforts.
       Expansion has continued at an accelerated pace as 900 restaurants
     were added in 1993, compared with 675 in 1992 and 615 in 1991.
     Restaurants opened during the year (excluding satellite locations)
     contributed $572 million to Systemwide sales in 1993, $478 million in
     1992 and $460 million in 1991.  McDonald's plans to add between 900
     and 1,200 restaurants (excluding satellite locations) around the world
     in 1994 and in each of the next several years.  The mix of net
     additions will remain the same -- approximately one-third in the U.S.
     and two-thirds in markets outside of the U.S.  Our global expansion
     plan also includes satellites -- sites that leverage the
     infrastructure of existing restaurants, either by using their storage
     capability or by drawing on their management talent and labor pool.
     At year-end 1993, 170 satellites were operating around the world.  In
     addition, we expect to add several hundred satellite locations around
     the world each year.

     TOTAL REVENUES
     Total revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and
     fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates, based
     upon a percent of sales with specified minimum payments.  The minimum
     franchise fee generally has been 12% of sales for new U.S. franchise
     arrangements since 1987.  Higher fees are charged for sites that
     require a higher investment on the part of the Company.  Fees paid by
     franchisees outside of the U.S. vary according to local business
     conditions. These fees, together with occupancy and operating rights,
     are stipulated in franchise arrangements that generally have 20-year
     terms.
       Revenues grow as restaurants are added and as existing restaurants
     build sales.  Menu price adjustments affect revenues as well as sales;
     however, different pricing structures, new products, promotions, and
     product mix variations make it impractical to quantify the impact for
     the System.


     
       The rates of increases in total revenues for 1993 and 1992 were
     less than the rates of increases in Systemwide sales.  In 1993, this
     reflected weaker foreign currencies which had a greater impact on
     revenues than on Systemwide sales and the increasing global base of
     franchised restaurants, occurring primarily from expansion.  In 1992,
     the franchising of certain Company-operated restaurant businesses
     primarily in the U.S. and Canada affected the rate of increase.
       Growth rates in sales by Company-operated restaurants and revenues
     from franchised restaurants varied because of expansion and changes in
     ownership and because sales by Company-operated restaurants were
     impacted to a greater degree by changing foreign currencies than were
     revenues.  In 1993, about 53% of sales by Company-operated restaurants
     were outside of the U.S., compared with 33% of revenues from
     franchised restaurants.

     RESTAURANT MARGINS
     Company-operated restaurant margins were 19.2% of sales in 1993,
     compared with 19.1% in 1992 and 17.9% in 1991.  As a percent of sales,
     food and paper costs increased, while occupancy, other operating and
     payroll costs declined in 1993.  All costs as a percent of sales
     declined in 1992.
       Franchised restaurant margins were 83.1% of applicable revenues for
     1993, compared with 82.8% in 1992 and 1991.  Franchised margins
     include revenues and expenses associated with restaurants operating
     under business facilities lease arrangements.  Under these
     arrangements, the Company leases the businesses -- including
     equipment -- to franchisees who have options to purchase the
     businesses. While higher fees are charged under these arrangements,
     margins are generally lower because of equipment depreciation.  When
     these purchase options are exercised, the resulting gains compensate
     the Company for lower margins prior to exercise and are included in
     other operating (income) expense--net.  At year-end 1993, 544
     restaurants were operating under such arrangements, compared with 583
     and 584 at year-end 1992 and 1991, respectively.

     GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND SELLING EXPENSES
     The 1993 increase was due primarily to higher employee costs
     associated with expansion and key priorities, partially offset by
     weaker foreign currencies.  The 1992 increase was due to higher
     employee costs associated with expansion, partially offset by a
     reduction in U.S. marketing costs associated with the value program.
     These expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales have remained
     relatively constant over the past five years, and were 4.0% in 1993
     and 3.9% in 1992.


     
     OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE--NET
     This category is comprised primarily of gains on sales of restaurant
     businesses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, and net
     gains or losses from property dispositions.  The 1993 and 1992 amounts
     were relatively constant, reflecting greater income from affiliates
     and gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 1993, offset by the
     favorable settlement of a sales tax case in Brazil in 1992.  Major
     factors contributing to the 1992 decrease included lower affiliate
     results due to 1991 gains from property dispositions and lower
     operating results in Japan, lower gains on sales of restaurant
     businesses, and greater losses on property dispositions, partially
     offset by the favorable settlement of a sales tax case in Brazil in
     1992.
       Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from
     exercises of purchase options by franchisees operating under business
     facilities lease arrangements and from sales of Company-operated
     restaurants.  As a franchisor, McDonald's purchases and sells
     businesses in transactions with franchisees and affiliates in an
     ongoing effort to achieve the optimal ownership mix in each market.
     These transactions and the resulting gains are integral to
     franchising, and are appropriately recorded in operating income.
       Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is reported after
     interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. partnerships that
     are reported before income taxes.  The Company actively participates
     in, but does not control, these businesses.
       Net gains or losses from property dispositions result from disposal
     of excess properties that occur because of closings, relocations and
     other transactions.

     OPERATING INCOME
     The 1993 and 1992 increases reflected better results from combined
     restaurant margins, partially offset by higher general, administrative
     and selling expenses.  Additionally, 1993 was impacted by weaker
     foreign currencies, while 1992 was impacted by lower income from other
     operating transactions and stronger foreign currencies.

     INTEREST EXPENSE
     The 1993 and 1992 decreases were primarily due to lower average debt
     balances and lower average interest rates; 1993 also was impacted by
     weaker foreign currencies.  The trends have been positively affected
     by the fact that cash provided by operations exceeded capital
     expenditures in each of the last three years.

     NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE)--NET
     This category includes interest income, gains and losses related to
     investments and financings, as well as miscellaneous income and
     expense.  The 1993 increase reflected $9 million in gains related to
     debt extinguishments and $29 million in charges related to various
     early redemptions of high-coupon, U.S. Dollar debt in 1992.


     
     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
     The effective tax rate increased to 35.4% for 1993, compared with
     33.8% for 1992 and 1991, primarily as a result of new U.S. tax
     legislation enacted in the third quarter of 1993 and lower foreign tax
     benefits.  The full-year impact of the U.S. tax law changes on the
     1993 income tax provision was approximately $20 million.  Of this
     amount, the retroactive impact was $15 million, comprised of nearly
     $14 million attributable to a one-time, noncash revaluation of
     deferred tax liabilities, and $1 million related to periods prior to
     the third quarter.  The Company expects its 1994 effective income tax
     rate to be in the 35.5% to 36.0% range.
       Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets of
     $148 million, net of valuation allowance, in 1993 and 1992.
     Substantially all of the tax assets arose from profitable markets and
     the majority is expected to be realized in future U.S. income tax
     returns.

     NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
     Net income and net income per common share increased 13 and 12
     percent, respectively, in 1993.  These increases were negatively
     affected by weaker foreign currencies and the new U.S. tax
     legislation.

     IMPACT OF CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCIES
     Changing foreign currencies do impact reported results from time to
     time, but McDonald's manages foreign currencies to mitigate business
     risk and the reporting impact.  As previously noted, weaker foreign
     currencies had a significant negative impact on 1993 results, while
     stronger foreign currencies had a positive impact in 1992.  Further
     discussion of our approach to managing changing foreign currencies can
     be found on pages 26 through 28 in Financings and Total Shareholders'
     Equity.

     SALES
     The 1993 and 1992 increases were due to higher sales and transaction
     counts at existing restaurants and expansion.  Sales and transaction
     counts in 1993 were positively driven by the emphasis on value and
     customer satisfaction in the form of Extra-Value Meals, Happy Meals,
     "2 for $2" offers and the Burger of the Month program; as well as the
     NBA Fantasy Pack Trading Card, Happy Birthday Big Mac, Jurassic Park,

     RESTAURANTS
     There were 324 restaurants added in the U.S. in 1993, representing 36%
     of Systemwide additions, compared with 195 additions and 29% in 1992,
     and 340 additions and 56% five years ago.  McDonald's expects to boost
     U.S. expansion in 1994 and in each of the next several years by adding
     between 300 and 400 restaurants, exclusive of satellites.

     ========================================================================

       Restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates represented 85%
     of U.S. restaurants at year-end 1993, compared with 78% five years
     ago.  During the period 1989 through 1991, the Company franchised
     certain restaurants it previously operated, while continuing to own or
     control the land and buildings.  The restaurants that had been
     franchised either were generating weak operating results, not building
     sales as expected, or located in outlying markets.  The franchising of
     these businesses accomplished several objectives.  On-site,
     entrepreneurial owners with an equity stake in the business improved
     operations, sales and profits; and franchising of these restaurants
     also improved consolidated profits.

     ========================================================================

     U.S. revenues were positively impacted by strong sales and expansion
     in 1993 and 1992, and negatively affected by the franchising of
     certain Company-operated restaurant businesses in 1992, 1991 and 1990.
       U.S. Company-operated margins increased $11 million or 3% in 1993.
     These margins were 18.3% of sales in 1993, compared with 18.4% in 1992
     and 17.0% in 1991.  U.S. franchised margins rose $102 million or 9% in
     1993, reflecting sales improvement and expansion.  These margins were
     83.6% of applicable revenues in 1993, compared with 83.2% in 1992 and
     83.3% in 1991.  While it is difficult to assess the potential effects
     of federal and state legislation in the U.S. that may impact the
     industry, the Company believes it can maintain operating margins
     within the same range of the past ten years by continuing to build
     sales and reduce costs.
       U.S. operating income rose $46 million or 4% in 1993 and was 55% of
     consolidated operating income, compared with 56% in 1992.  This
     increase resulted primarily from higher combined restaurant margins,
     partially offset by higher general, administrative and selling
     expenses in the form of higher employee costs and other expenditures
     to support our global strategies and strengthen our competencies.  The
     1992 increase was driven by strong sales and combined restaurant
     margins, partially offset by lower gains on sales of restaurant
     businesses in 1992 and a gain on the sale of real estate by a U.S.
     affiliate in 1991.  Operating income included $348 million of
     depreciation and amortization in 1993, compared with $330 million in
     1992 and $325 million in 1991.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     U.S. assets decreased $25 million or .4% in 1993, due to the
     utilization of year-end 1992 cash balances.  At year-end 1993, 53% of
     consolidated assets were located in the U.S., compared with 55% at
     year-end 1992.  Capital expenditures increased $187 million or 47% in
     1993, and represented 44% of consolidated capital expenditures,
     compared with 60% five years ago.  The amounts excluded expenditures
     made by franchisees such as their initial investments in equipment,
     signs, seating and decor and over the long term, ongoing reinvestment
     in their businesses.  New restaurant expenditures increased $136
     million or 69% because of accelerated expansion, tempered by lower
     average development costs.
       Expenditures for existing restaurants included modifications to
     achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction and implementation of
     technology to improve service and food quality.  The decline over time
     highlighted aggressive reinvestment in prior years.
       Rebuilding and relocating restaurants has generated additional
     sales, reflecting our ability to adjust to changing demographics,
     traffic patterns and market opportunities.  More than $35 million was
     spent for these investments in 1993 and $291 million over the past
     five years.  The rise in other property expenditures was attributable
     to the further testing of Leaps & Bounds, a family play center
     concept.

     =========================================================================

       Average land costs declined as a result of the implementation of
     low-cost building designs, which require smaller parcels, and a softer
     real estate market.  Average building costs decreased due to low-cost
     building designs and construction efficiencies.  Low-cost building
     designs comprised nearly 80% of 1993 openings, compared with 60% in
     1992.  Average equipment costs decreased due to standardization and
     global sourcing.  McDonald's intends to pursue ongoing development
     cost reductions by taking further advantage of standardization, global
     sourcing and economies of scale.


     
       The Company continues to emphasize restaurant property ownership.
     Real estate ownership yields long-term benefits, including the ability
     to fix occupancy costs.  In addition to purchasing new properties,
     previously leased properties are acquired.  The Company owned 68% of
     U.S. sites at year-end 1993, the same as five years ago.

     OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     SALES
     The 1993 and 1992 increases were due to expansion and higher sales at
     existing restaurants; however, 1993 was impacted by weaker foreign
     currencies, most notably the European currencies along with the
     Canadian and Australian Dollars.  On the other hand, 1992 benefited
     from stronger foreign currencies in the form of the Japanese Yen,
     Deutsche Mark and French Franc.  Strong operating results have been
     achieved in the past several years despite weak economies in several
     countries, particularly Canada, England and Japan.

     ======================================================================

       European sales rose because of accelerated expansion and higher
     sales at existing restaurants, partially offset by weaker foreign
     currencies.  Asia/Pacific sales grew because of expansion coupled with
     the favorable impact of a stronger Japanese Yen.  Latin American sales
     increased because of expansion and higher sales at existing
     restaurants.  Canadian sales were negatively impacted by the weaker
     currency, partially offset by higher sales at existing restaurants and
     expansion.
       In 1993, four of the six largest markets outside of the U.S. --
     France, Germany, Australia and England -- reported double digit sales
     increases on a local currency basis.  Other markets -- including
     Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Hong Kong,
     Hungary, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama,
     Puerto Rico, Scotland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan,
     Thailand, Turkey and Wales -- delivered excellent results on a local
     currency basis.

     RESTAURANTS
     During the past five years, 60% of Systemwide additions have been
     outside of the U.S.  Of the 576 restaurants added in 1993, 54% were in
     the six largest markets, compared with 57% in 1992 and 63% in 1991.
     This continued relative decline was indicative of the growing
     importance of emerging markets.  McDonald's expects to boost expansion
     outside of the U.S. in 1994 and in each of the next several years by
     adding between 600 and 800 restaurants, exclusive of satellites.

     Germany, Australia, France, Japan and the Netherlands.  Restaurants
     operated by affiliates were principally located in Japan and other

     =======================================================================

     The 1993 and 1992 revenue and operating income increases reflected
     accelerated expansion and better performance despite weak economies in
     several major markets.  Changing foreign currencies had a negative
     effect in 1993 and a positive one in 1992 on these increases.


     
       Company-operated and franchised dollar margins were negatively
     impacted by weaker foreign currencies.  Company-operated margins
     increased $6 million or 1% in 1993.  These margins improved to 20.1%
     of sales in 1993, compared with 19.8% in 1992 and 18.8% in 1991.
     Franchised margins grew $86 million or 17% in 1993.  These margins
     were 82.0% of applicable revenues in 1993, compared with 82.1% in 1992
     and 81.5% in 1991.
       The 1993 and 1992 increases in general, administrative and selling
     expenses were due primarily to higher employee costs associated with
     expansion, partially offset by weaker foreign currencies in 1993.
       Other operating income decreased in 1993 due to the favorable
     settlement of a sales tax case in Brazil in 1992, offset somewhat by
     1993 increases in gains on sales of restaurant businesses and greater
     affiliate earnings.  Other operating income decreased in 1992 due to
     lower affiliate results and lower gains on sales of restaurant
     businesses, offset somewhat by the favorable settlement of a sales tax
     case in Brazil.
       Operations outside of the U.S. continued to contribute greater
     amounts to consolidated results as shown below:

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment accounted for 64% of revenues
     and 61% of operating income outside of the U.S. in 1993, growing $49
     and $64 million, respectively.  Germany, England and France accounted
     for 85% of this segment's operating income, compared with 90% in 1992.
     The 1993 increases were primarily due to strong operating results in
     Germany and France, as well as many emerging markets, offset by weaker
     foreign currencies.  England's operating income decrease was due to
     the significant impact of the weaker currency.  The majority of the
     1992 revenue and operating income increases were generated by Germany,
     France and England.
       Asia/Pacific revenues grew $60 million and operating income
     increased $27 million in 1993; 82% of the operating income was
     contributed by Australia, Japan and Hong Kong.  The 1993 increases
     were attributable to expansion and developing economies in many
     Asia/Pacific markets, with the exception of Japan which continues to
     suffer from a weak economy.  In 1992, stronger operations in
     Australia, and better results in Hong Kong and Singapore improved
     operating income, while earnings from Japan were affected by the
     economy.
       Latin American revenues grew $22 million, while operating income
     decreased $12 million in 1993.  The 1993 increase in revenues was
     primarily a function of expansion, while the decrease in operating
     income reflected the favorable settlement of a sales tax case in
     Brazil in 1992, partially offset by better results in Argentina.
     Brazil was affected by a weak economy in 1993 and 1992.


     
       Canadian revenues decreased $37 million due to a weaker Canadian
     Dollar in 1993.  Operating income decreased $2 million, reflecting the
     weaker currency and a decrease in other operating income, partially
     offset by better Company-operated margins.  Revenues decreased in 1992
     due to the franchising of certain restaurant businesses and the weaker
     currency, while operating income declined due to lower gains on sales
     of restaurant businesses and the weaker currency.

     ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Assets outside of the U.S. rose $379 million or 7% in 1993; the
     effects of expansion were partially offset by weaker foreign
     currencies.  At year-end 1993, about 47% of consolidated assets were
     located outside of the U.S.; 64% of these assets were located in
     England, France, Germany, Canada and Australia.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       In the past five years, nearly $3.8 billion has been invested
     outside of the U.S.; in 1993, capital expenditures rose in all
     geographic segments except Canada.  Weaker foreign currencies
     negatively impacted Europe, Asia/Pacific and Canada.  Approximately
     72% of capital expenditures outside of the U.S. were invested in
     Europe -- primarily in Germany, France and England.
       In general, average development costs for new restaurants for the
     five largest, majority-owned markets -- Australia, Canada, England,
     France and Germany -- were nearly double the U.S. average; such costs
     accommodate higher sales volumes and transaction counts.  Even so,
     1993 average development costs have decreased approximately one-third
     since 1991 in these markets.  Over the past two years, average
     development costs have decreased due to construction and design
     efficiencies, standardization, global sourcing and changes in the mix
     of openings, and because of weaker foreign currencies in 1993.
       Expenditures for existing restaurants included seating and decor
     upgrades, and equipment required for new products and operating
     efficiencies.  The majority of these expenditures were in Europe.
     Expenditures for other properties were principally for office
     facilities.


     
       As in the U.S., business outside of the U.S. emphasizes restaurant
     property ownership.  However, various laws and regulations make
     property acquisition and ownership much more difficult than in the
     U.S.  Ownership is obtained when practical; otherwise, long-term
     leases are an alternative.  In addition, certain markets have laws and
     customs that offer stronger tenancy rights than are available in the
     U.S.  The Company and affiliates owned 36% of sites outside of the
     U.S. at year-end 1993, compared with 35% five years ago.

       Capital expenditures made by affiliates -- which were not included
     in consolidated amounts -- were $207 million in 1993, compared with
     $206 million in 1992.  The majority of the 1993 expenditures were for
     development in Japan, Argentina and Russia.  Included in the amounts
     for Russia were costs for constructing an office building which is
     leased primarily to third parties.

     FINANCIAL POSITION
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     TOTAL ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Total assets grew $354 million or 3% in 1993; net property and
     equipment represented 84% of total assets and rose $484 million.
     Capital expenditures increased $204 million or 18%, reflecting higher
     expansion, partially offset by lower average development costs and
     weaker foreign currencies.

     CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS
     Cash provided by operations increased $254 million or 18% in 1993, and
     was relatively flat in 1992 mainly due to $159 million in payments
     related to various prior years' tax matters.  Together with other
     sources of cash such as borrowings, cash provided by operations was
     used primarily for capital expenditures, debt repayments, share
     repurchase and dividends.  For the third straight year, cash provided
     by operations exceeded capital expenditures.
       While cash generated is significant relative to cash required, the
     Company also has the ability to meet short-term needs through
     commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.
     Accordingly, a relatively low current ratio has been purposefully
     maintained; it was .60 at year-end 1993.
       The Company believes that cash flow measures are meaningful
     indicators of growth and financial strength, when evaluated in the
     context of absolute dollars, uses and consistency.  Over the past five
     years, cash flow coverage has improved significantly.  Cash provided
     by operations is expected to cover capital expenditures over the next
     several years, even as expansion continues to accelerate.

     FINANCINGS
     The Company strives to minimize interest expense and the impact of
     changing foreign currencies, while maintaining the capacity to meet
     increasing growth requirements.  To accomplish these objectives,
     McDonald's generally finances long-term assets with long-term debt in
     the currencies in which the assets are denominated, while remaining
     flexible to take advantage of changing foreign currencies and interest
     rates.


     
       Over the years, major capital markets and various techniques have
     been utilized to meet financing requirements and reduce interest
     expense.  Currency exchange agreements have been employed in
     conjunction with borrowings to obtain desired currencies at attractive
     rates.  Interest-rate exchange agreements and interest-rate caps have
     been used to effectively convert fixed-rate to floating-rate debt, or
     vice versa, and to limit interest expense.  Foreign-denominated debt
     has been used to lessen the impact of changing foreign currencies on
     net income and shareholders' equity.  Total foreign-denominated debt,
     including the effects of currency exchange agreements, was $3.1 and
     $2.7 billion at year-end 1993 and 1992, respectively.
       The Company manages its debt portfolio, including the use of
     derivatives, in order to respond to changes in interest rates and
     foreign currencies.  Accordingly, the Company periodically retires,
     redeems, and repurchases debt, and terminates exchange agreements.
     While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, the Company
     actively hedges the seven currencies that have significant potential
     impact in order to minimize the cash exposure of royalty and other
     payments received in the U.S. in foreign currencies.  In addition,
     McDonald's restaurants primarily purchase goods and services in local
     currencies resulting in natural hedges; McDonald's typically finances
     in local currencies creating economic hedges; and the Company's
     foreign currency exposure is diversified within a basket of
     currencies, as opposed to one or several.

       Moody's and Standard & Poor's have rated McDonald's debt Aa2 and
     AA, respectively, since 1982.  Duff & Phelps began rating the debt in
     1990, and currently rates it AA+.  The Company has not experienced,
     nor does it expect to experience, difficulty in obtaining financing or
     in refinancing existing debt. The Company had $1.7 billion under line
     of credit agreements and $685 million under previously filed shelf
     registrations available at year-end 1993 for future debt issuance.
       Although McDonald's prefers to own real estate, leases are an
     alternative financing method.  As in the past, some new properties
     will be leased.  Such leases frequently include renewal and/or
     purchase options.  In the past five years, McDonald's has leased
     properties related to 41% of U.S. openings and 67% of openings outside
     of the U.S.


     

     During the past three years, the Company has improved its balance
     sheet by reducing leverage while simultaneously increasing expansion
     and repurchasing shares.  Total debt as a percent of total
     capitalization -- defined as total debt and total shareholders'
     equity -- was 37% at year-end 1993, compared with 40% and 49% at year-
     end 1992 and 1991, respectively.

     TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
     Total shareholders' equity rose $382 million and represented 52% of
     total assets at year-end 1993.  One technique used to enhance common
     shareholder value is share repurchase through excess cash flow or debt
     capacity, while maintaining a strong equity base for future expansion.
     At year-end 1993, the market value of shares repurchased by the
     Company and recorded as common stock in treasury was $3.5 billion.
       In conjunction with efforts to enhance common shareholder value,
     the Company recently announced its intention to purchase up to $1
     billion of its common stock within the next three years, primarily
     from excess cash flow.  In 1993, the Company completed a $700 million
     common share repurchase program begun in 1992.  In order to lower the
     cost of equity capital, the Company issued $500 million of Series E
     7.72% Cumulative Preferred Stock in 1992; at the same time, the Board
     of Directors authorized a $500 million common share repurchase program
     and the use of derivatives.  Subsequently, the Board authorized an
     additional $200 million expenditure for share repurchase in 1993.
       Weaker foreign currencies reduced shareholders' equity by $65
     million in 1993; however, financing foreign-denominated assets with
     foreign-denominated debt tempered the effect.  At year-end 1993,
     foreign-denominated assets not entirely financed with the related
     foreign-denominated debt were primarily located in England, Canada,
     Australia, France and Germany.

     RETURNS
     Return on average assets is computed using income before provision for
     income taxes, preferred dividends and interest expense.  Net income,
     less preferred stock dividends (net of tax in 1993 and 1992), is used
     to calculate return on average common equity.  Month-end balances are
     used to compute both average assets and average common equity.

                                    1993    1992     1991     1990     1989
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Return on average assets       17.1    16.1     15.8     16.7     17.3

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The 1993 and 1992 improvements in return on average assets
     reflected better global operating results and a slower rate of asset
     growth.  The 1993 improvement in return on average common equity
     reflected higher levels of share repurchase, whereas declines in 1992
     and 1991 resulted from lower levels of share repurchase as excess cash
     flow was used to reduce debt.  In recent years, returns were affected
     by soft economies in the U.S. and certain markets outside of the U.S.
     Also influencing these returns were expansion outside of the U.S. and,
     prior to 1991, escalating development costs and higher reinvestment.


     
     EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES--INFLATION
     McDonald's has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost
     increases effectively.  Rapid inventory turnover, the ability to
     adjust prices, substantial property holdings--many of which are at
     fixed costs and partially financed by debt made cheaper by inflation--
     and cost controls have enabled McDonald's to mitigate the effects of
     inflation.

     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     The Board of Directors and Shareholders
     McDonald's Corporation
     Oak Brook, Illinois

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
     McDonald's Corporation as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
     related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
     cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
     31, 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of
     McDonald's Corporation management. Our responsibility is to express an
     opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
       We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
     auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
     the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
     statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
     disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
     assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
     made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
     reasonable basis for our opinion.
       In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
     fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
     of McDonald's Corporation at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
     consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
     the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity
     with generally accepted accounting principles.

     MCDONALD'S CORPORATION FINANCIAL COMMENTS

     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
     Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in 50% or less owned
     affiliates are carried at equity in the companies' net assets.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
     The functional currency of each operation outside of the U.S., except
     for those located in hyperinflationary countries, is the respective
     local currency.

     INCOME TAXES
     In 1992, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
     Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The effects were not
     material, as the Company had previously adopted Statement No. 96.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
     Property and equipment are stated at cost with depreciation and
     amortization provided on the straight-line method over the following
     estimated useful lives: buildings--up to 40 years; leasehold
     improvements--lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms
     including option periods; and equipment--3 to 12 years.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS
     Intangible assets consist primarily of franchise rights reacquired
     from franchisees and affiliates, and are amortized on the straight-
     line method over an average life of 29 years.

     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     Non-U.S. Dollar financing transactions generally are effective as
     hedges of long-term investments in the corresponding currency.
     Interest-rate exchange agreements are designated and generally are
     effective as hedges of the Company's interest-rate exposures. The
     carrying amounts for cash and equivalents and notes receivable
     approximated fair value. For noninterest-bearing security deposits by
     franchisees, no fair value was provided as these deposits are an
     integral part of the overall franchise arrangements.

     STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
     The Company considers all highly liquid investments with short-term
     maturity dates to be cash equivalents. The impact of changing foreign
     currencies on cash and equivalents was not material.

     Franchisees operating under business facilities lease arrangements
     have options to purchase the businesses. The results of operations of
     restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with
     franchisees and affiliates were not material to the consolidated
     financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale.

       U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on
     $760.8 million of undistributed earnings of certain subsidiaries and
     affiliates outside of the U.S. at December 31, 1993. These earnings are
     considered to be permanently invested in the businesses and, under the
     tax laws, are not subject to taxes until distributed as dividends. If
     these earnings were not considered permanently invested, no additional
     taxes would be provided due to the overall higher tax rates in markets
     outside of the U.S. and the ability to recover withholding taxes as
     foreign tax credits in the U.S.

     Depreciation and amortization were: 1993--$492.8 million; 1992--$492.9
     million; 1991--$456.9 million. Contractual obligations for the
     acquisition and construction of property amounted to $193.1 million at
     December 31, 1993.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     DEBT FINANCING
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS
     The Company has a long-term line of credit agreement for $700.0
     million, which remained unused at December 31, 1993, and which
     continues indefinitely unless terminated by the participating banks
     upon advance notice of at least 18 months. Each borrowing under the
     agreement bears interest at one of several specified floating rates,
     to be selected by the Company at the time of borrowing. The agreement
     provides for fees of .15 of 1% per annum on the unused portion of the
     commitment. In addition, certain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. had
     unused lines of credit totaling $1.0 billion at December 31, 1993;
     these were principally short-term and denominated in various
     currencies at local market rates of interest.


     

     EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS
     The Company uses derivatives and has entered into agreements for the
     exchange of various currencies. Certain of these agreements also
     provide for the periodic exchange of interest payments. These
     agreements, as well as additional interest-rate exchange agreements,
     expire through 2003 and provide for an effective right of offset;
     therefore, the related receivable and liability are offset in the
     financial statements. The counterparties to these exchange agreements
     consist of a diverse group of financial institutions. The Company
     continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its
     counterparties, and adjusts positions as appropriate.
       The Company also had short-term forward foreign exchange contracts
     outstanding at December 31, 1993, with a U.S. Dollar equivalent of
     $83.4 million in various currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen,
     Deutsche Mark and British Pound Sterling.

     AGGREGATE MATURITIES
     Included in the 1995 maturities are $700.0 million of notes maturing
     within one year, as 1995 is the earliest time at which the banks can
     terminate the line of credit agreement, which supports the
     classification in long-term debt. Under certain agreements, the
     Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par
     or at a premium over par. During 1993, $264.5 million was retired
     prior to maturity.

     GUARANTEES
     Included in total debt at December 31, 1993, were $171.3 million of
     7.60% ESOP Notes Series A and $89.0 million of 7.23% ESOP Notes Series
     B issued by the Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (LESOP), with
     payments through 2004 and 2006, respectively, which are guaranteed by
     the Company. Interest rates on the notes were adjusted due to U.S. tax
     law changes in 1993. The Company has agreed to repurchase the notes
     upon the occurrence of certain events.
       The Company also has guaranteed certain foreign affiliate loans of
     $154.7 million at December 31, 1993. The Company also was a general
     partner in 48 domestic partnerships with total assets of
     $174.3 million and total liabilities of $95.8 million at December 31,
     1993.

     FAIR VALUES
     The carrying amounts for notes payable and short-term forward foreign
     exchange contracts approximated fair value at December 31, 1993. The
     fair value of the remaining debt obligations (excluding capital
     leases), including the net effects of currency and interest-rate
     exchange agreements, was estimated using quoted market prices, various
     pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses. At December 31, 1993,
     the fair value of these obligations, which were primarily used to
     finance property and equipment, was $3.7 billion, compared to a
     carrying value of $3.4 billion. The Company currently has no plans to
     retire any of these obligations prior to maturity.
       The Company believes that the fair value of total assets is higher
     than their carrying value.

     In 1993, a Company subsidiary issued 50 million British Pounds
     Sterling (U.S. $74.0 million at December 31, 1993) of 5.91% Series A
     Preferred Stock which, unless redeemed earlier at the Company's
     option, must be redeemed on February 19, 1998. Also, another
     subsidiary issued additional preferred stock.  All of the preferred
     stock of this subsidiary has a dividend rate adjusted annually (8.2%
     at December 31, 1993) and is redeemable at the option of the holder at
     a current redemption price of $32.7 million. Both of these issues were
     reflected in preferred interests in consolidated subsidiaries.
       Included in other was the $100.00 per share redemption value of
     181,868 shares of 5% Series D Preferred Stock issued in connection
     with the Company's 1991 increase in ownership of its Hawaii affiliate.
     This stock, which carries one vote per share, must be redeemed on the
     occurrence of specified events.


     
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     LEASING ARRANGEMENTS
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     At December 31, 1993, the Company was lessee at 2,294 restaurant
     locations under ground leases (the Company leases land and constructs
     and owns buildings) and at 2,305 locations under improved leases
     (lessor owns land and buildings). Land and building lease terms are
     generally for 20 to 25 years and, in many cases, provide for rent
     escalations and one or more five-year renewal options with certain
     leases providing purchase options. The Company is generally obligated
     for the related occupancy costs that include property taxes, insurance
     and maintenance. In addition, the Company is lessee under
     noncancelable leases covering offices and vehicles.
       Future minimum payments required under operating leases with
     initial terms of one year or more after December 31, 1993, are:

     based on sales by the related restaurants in excess of minimum rents
     stipulated in certain lease agreements: 1993--$29.0 million;
     1992--$26.1 million; 1991--$26.3 million.

     Franchise arrangements, with franchisees who operate in various
     geographic locations, generally provide for initial fees and
     continuing payments to the Company based upon a percentage of sales,
     with minimum rent payments. Among other things, franchisees are
     provided the use of restaurant facilities, generally for a period of
     20 years. They are required to pay related occupancy costs that
     include property taxes, insurance, maintenance and a refundable,
     noninterest-bearing security deposit. On a limited basis, the Company
     receives notes from franchisees. Generally the notes are secured by
     interests in restaurant equipment and franchises.

     billion.


     
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company has a program for U.S. employees which includes profit
     sharing, 401(k) (McDESOP), and leveraged employee stock ownership
     features. McDESOP allows employees to invest in McDonald's common
     stock by making contributions that are partially matched by the
     Company. Assets of the profit sharing plan can be invested in
     McDonald's common stock, or among several other alternatives. Certain
     subsidiaries outside of the U.S. also offer profit sharing, stock
     purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total U.S. program costs
     were: 1993--$47.1 million; 1992--$38.8 million; 1991--$46.4 million.
     Total plan costs outside of the U.S. were: 1993--$13.0 million; 1992--
     $14.0 million; 1991--$9.8 million. The Company does not provide any
     other postretirement benefits, and postemployment benefits were
     immaterial.


     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     STOCK OPTIONS
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Under the 1992 Stock Ownership Incentive and the 1975 Stock Ownership
     Option Plans, options to purchase common stock are granted at prices
     not less than fair market value of the stock on date of grant.
     Substantially all of these options become exercisable in four equal
     biennial installments, commencing one year from date of grant, and
     expire ten years from date of grant. At December 31, 1993, 41.5
     million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under both
     plans.

     CAPITAL STOCK

     PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION
     Income used in the computation of per common share information was
     reduced by preferred stock cash dividends (net of tax benefits in 1993
     and 1992) and divided by the weighted average shares of common stock
     outstanding during each year: 1993--355.9 million; 1992--363.2
     million; 1991--358.1 million. The effect of potentially dilutive
     securities was not material.

     PREFERRED STOCK
     In December 1992, the Company issued $500.0 million of Series E 7.72%
     Cumulative Preferred Stock; 10,000 preferred shares are equivalent to
     20.0 million depositary shares having a liquidation preference of
     $25.00 per depositary share. Each preferred share is entitled to one
     vote under certain circumstances, and is redeemable at the option of
     the Company beginning on December 3, 1997, at its liquidation
     preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
       In September 1989 and April 1991, the Company sold $200.0 million
     of Series B and $100.0 million of Series C ESOP Convertible Preferred
     Stock, respectively, to the LESOP. The LESOP financed the purchase by
     issuing notes that are guaranteed by the Company and are included in
     long-term debt, with an offsetting reduction in shareholders' equity.
     Each preferred share has a liquidation preference of $28.75 and
     $33.125, respectively, and is convertible into a minimum of .7692 and
     .8 common share (conversion rate), respectively. Upon termination,
     employees are guaranteed a minimum value payable in common shares
     equal to the greater of the conversion rate; the fair market value of
     their preferred shares; or the liquidation preference plus accrued
     dividends, not to exceed one common share. Each preferred share is
     entitled to one vote and is redeemable at the option of the Company
     three years after issuance and, under certain circumstances, is
     redeemable prior to that date. In 1992, 4.1 million Series B shares
     were converted into 3.2 million common shares.

     In December 1992, the Company sold 2.0 million common equity put
     options. At December 31, 1992, the $94.0 million exercise price of
     these options was classified in common equity put options and the
     related offset was recorded in common stock in treasury, net of
     premiums received. In April 1993, these options expired unexercised.
     In April 1993, the Company also sold 1.0 million common equity put
     options which expired unexercised in July 1993.


     
     SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
     In December 1988, the Company declared a dividend of one Preferred
     Share Purchase Right (Right) on each outstanding share of common
     stock. Under certain conditions, each Right may be exercised to
     purchase one two-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
     Preferred Stock (the economic equivalent of one common share) at an
     exercise price of $125.00 (which may be adjusted under certain
     circumstances), and is transferable apart from the common stock ten
     days following a public announcement that a person or group has
     acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding common
     shares, or ten business days following the commencement or
     announcement of an intention to make a tender or exchange offer,
     resulting in beneficial ownership by a person or group of 20% or more
     of the outstanding common shares.
       If a person or group acquires 20% or more of the outstanding common
     shares, or if the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
     combination transaction, each Right will entitle the holder, other
     than such person or group, to purchase at the then current exercise
     price, stock of the Company or the acquiring company having a market
     value of twice the exercise price.
       Each Right is nonvoting and expires on December 28, 1998, unless
     redeemed by the Company, at a price of $.005, at any time prior to the
     public announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
     ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding common shares. At December
     31, 1993, 2.1 million shares of the Series A Junior Participating
     Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance under this plan.

     We have audited the consolidated financial statements of McDonald's
     Corporation as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and for each of the
     three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, and have issued our
     report thereon dated January 27, 1994 (included elsewhere in this
     Annual Report on Form 10-K).  Our audits also included the
     consolidated financial statement schedules of McDonald's Corporation
     listed in Item 14(a).  These schedules are the responsibility of the
     Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
     based on our audits.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statement schedules
     referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic
     consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in
     all material respects the information set forth therein.
