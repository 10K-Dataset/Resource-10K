                                     PART I

     Item 1.   Business

          McDonald's Corporation, the registrant, together with its
     subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the "Company".

          (a)  General development of business

           There have been no significant changes to the Company's
     corporate structure during 1995, nor material changes in the Company's
     method of conducting business.

          (b)  Financial information about industry segments

           Industry segment data for the years ended December 31, 1995,
     1994 and 1993 is included in Part II, item 8, page 44 of this
     Form 10-K.

          (c)  Narrative description of business

          General

           The Company develops, operates, franchises and services a
     worldwide system of restaurants which prepare, assemble, package and
     sell a limited menu of value-priced foods. These restaurants are
     operated by the Company or, under the terms of franchise arrangements,
     by franchisees who are independent third parties, or by affiliates
     operating under joint-venture agreements between the Company and local
     businesspeople.

           The Company's franchising program is designed to assure
     consistency and quality.  The Company is selective in granting
     franchises and is not in the practice of franchising to investor
     groups or passive investors.  Under the conventional franchise
     arrangement, franchisees supply capital - initially, by purchasing
     equipment, signs, seating, and decor, and over the long term, by
     reinvesting in the business.  The Company shares the investment by
     owning or leasing the land and building; franchisees then contribute
     to the Company's revenues through payment of rent and service fees
     based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum payments.
     Generally, the conventional franchise arrangement lasts 20 years and
     franchising practices are consistent throughout the world.  Further
     discussion regarding site selection is included in Part 1, item 2,
     page 6 of this Form 10-K.

           Training begins at the restaurant with one-on-one instruction
     and videotapes.  Aspiring restaurant managers progress through a
     development program of classes in basic and intermediate operations,
     management and equipment.  Assistant managers are eligible to attend
     the advanced operations and management class at one of the five
     Hamburger University (H.U.) campuses in the U.S., Germany, England,
     Japan or Australia.  The curriculum at H.U. concentrates on skills and
     practices essential to delivering customer satisfaction and running a
     restaurant business.

     
           The Company's global brand is well-known.  Marketing and
     promotional activities are designed to nurture this brand image and
     differentiate the Company from competitors by focusing on value, taste
     and customer satisfaction.  Funding for promotions is handled at the
     local restaurant level; funding for regional and national efforts is
     handled through advertising cooperatives.  Franchised, Company-
     operated and affiliated restaurants throughout the world make
     voluntary contributions to cooperatives which purchase media.
     Production costs for certain advertising efforts are borne by the
     Company.

          Products

           McDonald's restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu
     consisting of hamburgers and cheeseburgers, including the Big Mac and
     Quarter Pounder with Cheese sandwiches, the Filet-O-Fish, McGrilled
     Chicken and McChicken sandwiches, french fries, Chicken McNuggets,
     salads, shakes, sundaes and cones made with low fat frozen yogurt,
     pies, cookies and a limited number of soft drinks and other beverages.
     In addition, the restaurants sell a variety of products during limited
     promotional time periods. McDonald's restaurants operating in the
     United States are open during breakfast hours and offer a full
     breakfast menu including the Egg McMuffin and the Sausage McMuffin
     with Egg sandwiches, hotcakes and sausage; three varieties of biscuit
     sandwiches; Apple-Bran muffins; and cereals. McDonald's restaurants in
     many countries around the world offer many of these same products as
     well as other products and limited breakfast menus. The Company tests
     new products on an ongoing basis.

           The Company, its franchisees and affiliates purchase food
     products and packaging from numerous independent suppliers.  Quality
     specifications for both raw and cooked food products are established
     and strictly enforced.  Alternative sources of these items are
     generally available.  Quality assurance labs in the U.S., Europe and
     the Pacific work to ensure that the Company's high standards are
     consistently met.  The quality assurance process involves ongoing
     testing and on-site inspections of suppliers' facilities.
     Independently owned and operated distribution centers distribute
     products and supplies to most McDonald's restaurants.  The restaurants
     then prepare, assemble and package these products using specially
     designed production techniques and equipment to obtain uniform
     standards of quality.

          Trademarks and patents

           The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, some
     of which, including "McDonald's", "Ronald McDonald" and other related
     marks, are of material importance to the Company's business. The
     Company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while
     valuable, are not material to its business.

          Seasonal operations

           The Company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to
     any material degree.

     
          Working capital practices

           Information about the Company's working capital practices is
     incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and
     Analysis of the Company's financial position and the consolidated
     statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994
     and 1993 in Part II, item 7, pages 27 through 30, and Part II, item 8,
     page 36 of this Form 10-K.

          Customers

           The Company's business is not dependent upon a single customer
     or small group of customers.

          Backlog

           Company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.

          Government contracts

           No material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation
     of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election
     of the U.S. government.

          Competition

           McDonald's restaurants compete with international, national,
     regional, and local retailers of food products.  The Company competes
     on the basis of price and service and by offering quality food
     products.  The Company's competition in the broadest perspective
     includes restaurants, quick-service eating establishments, pizza
     parlors, coffee shops, street vendors, convenience food stores,
     delicatessens, and supermarket freezers.

           In the U.S., about 395,000 restaurants generate nearly $240
     billion in annual sales.  McDonald's accounts for about 2.9% of those
     restaurants and approximately 6.6% of those sales.  No reasonable
     estimate can be made of the number of competitors outside of the U.S.;
     however, the Company's business in foreign markets continues to grow.

          Research and development

           The Company operates research and development facilities in
     Illinois. While research and development activities are important to
     the Company's business, these expenditures are not material.
     Independent suppliers also conduct research activities for the benefit
     of the McDonald's System, which includes franchisees and suppliers, as
     well as McDonald's, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.

     
          Environmental matters

           The Company is not aware of any federal, state or local
     environmental laws or regulations which will materially affect its
     earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital
     expenditures; however, the Company cannot predict the effect on its
     operations of possible future environmental legislation or
     regulations. During 1995, there were no material capital expenditures
     for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures
     are anticipated.

          Number of employees

           During 1995, the Company's average number of employees
     worldwide, including company-operated restaurant employees, was
     approximately 212,000.

          (d)  Financial information about foreign and domestic operations

           Financial information about foreign and domestic markets is
     incorporated herein by reference from Selected Financial Data,
     Management's Discussion and Analysis and Segment and Geographic
     Information in Part II, item 6, page 10, Part II, item 7, pages 11
     through 30 and Part II, item 8, page 44, respectively, of this Form
     10-K.

     Item 2.   Properties

           The Company identifies and develops sites that offer
     convenience to customers and provide for long-term sales and profit
     potential.  To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and
     walking patterns, census data, school enrollments and other relevant
     data.  The Company's experience and access to advanced technology aids
     in evaluating this information.  In order to control occupancy costs
     and rights, the Company owns restaurant sites and buildings where
     feasible and where it is not practical, secures long-term leases.
     Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is
     important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to lower average
     development costs through construction and design efficiencies,
     standardization and by leveraging the Company's global sourcing
     system.  Additional information about the Company's properties is
     included in Management's Discussion and Analysis and the related
     financial statements with footnotes in Part II, item 7, pages 11
     through 30 and Part II, item 8, pages 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 43, 50 and
     51, respectively, of this Form 10-K.

     Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

           The Company has pending a number of lawsuits which have been
     filed from time to time in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover
     a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company's entire business.
     The following is a brief description of the more significant of these
     categories of lawsuits and government regulations.  The Company does
     not believe that any such claims or lawsuits will have a material
     adverse affect on its financial condition or results of operations.

     
          Franchising

           A substantial number of McDonald's restaurants are franchised
     to independent businesspeople operating under arrangements with the
     Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional
     disputes arise between the Company and its franchisees relating to a
     broad range of subjects including, without limitation, quality,
     service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or
     terminations of franchises, franchisee claims for additional
     franchises or rewrites of franchises, and delinquent payments.

          Suppliers

           The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply,
     with minor exceptions outside of the United States, food, paper, or
     related items to any McDonald's restaurants. The Company relies upon
     independent suppliers which are required to meet and maintain the
     Company's standards and specifications. There are a number of such
     suppliers worldwide and on occasion disputes arise between the Company
     and its suppliers on a number of issues including, by way of example,
     compliance with product specifications and McDonald's business
     relationship with suppliers.

          Employees

           Thousands of persons are employed by the Company and in
     restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In
     addition, thousands of persons, from time to time, seek employment in
     such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes arise
     regarding hiring, firing and promotion practices.

          Customers

           McDonald's restaurants serve a large cross-section of the
     public and in the course of serving so many people, disputes arise as
     to products, service, accidents and other matters typical of an
     extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.

          Trademarks

           McDonald's has registered trademarks and service marks, some of
     which are of material importance to the Company's business.  From time
     to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to defend and
     protect its use of such registered marks.

          Government Regulations

           Local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and
     regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business,
     including, but not limited to, franchising, health, environment,
     zoning and employment. The Company does not believe that it is in
     violation of any existing statutory or administrative rules, but it
     cannot predict the effect on its operations from promulgation of
     additional requirements in the future.

     
     Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Shareholders

           None.

     Executive Officers of the Registrant

           All of the executive officers of McDonald's Corporation as of
     March 1, 1996 are shown below. Each of the executive officers has been
     continuously employed by the Company for at least five years and has a

           The approximate number of shareholders of record and beneficial
     owners of the Company's common stock as of January 31, 1996 was
     estimated to be 798,500.

           Given the Company's returns on equity and assets, the Company's
     management believes it is prudent to reinvest a significant portion of
     earnings back into the business.  The Company has paid 80 consecutive
     quarterly dividends on common stock through March 29, 1996, has
     increased the per share amount 21 times since the first dividend was
     paid in 1976, and has increased the dividend amount every year.
     Additional dividend increases will be considered after reviewing
     returns to shareholders, profitability expectations and financing
     needs.

     SYSTEMWIDE SALES AND RESTAURANTS
     Systemwide sales are comprised of sales by restaurants operated by the
     Company, franchisees and affiliates operating under joint-venture
     agreements between McDonald's and local businesspeople. The 1995 and
     1994 sales increases were primarily due to expansion. Stronger foreign
     currencies and higher sales at existing restaurants also contributed
     to these increases. Sales by Company-operated restaurants grew at a
     higher rate than Systemwide sales in 1995 and 1994. For both years,
     the number of Company-operated restaurants grew at a higher rate than
     Systemwide restaurants, and for 1995, Company-operated comparable
     sales were also stronger than Systemwide comparable sales.
       Average sales by Systemwide restaurants open at least one year were
     $1,844,000 in 1995, $44,000 higher than in 1994. Average sales
     improved due to stronger foreign currencies and higher sales at
     existing restaurants, partially offset by lower average sales for
     newer, smaller restaurants. The Company expects that average sales
     will continue to be affected by an increasing proportion of lower-
     volume sites. Profitable expansion into these sites, consistent with
     our Convenience Strategy to gain market share, has been made possible
     by a low-cost approach to restaurant development.
       Expansion continued at an accelerated pace as 2,430 restaurants
     were added Systemwide in 1995 (1,604 traditional and 826 satellites),
     compared with 1,787 in 1994 (1,212 traditional and 575 satellites) and
     1,070 in 1993 (900 traditional and 170 satellites). Generally,
     satellite restaurants offer a simplified menu and are smaller in size
     and sales volume compared to traditional restaurants. McDonald's plans
     to add between 2,500 and 3,200 restaurants around the world annually
     in 1996 and 1997. Between 1,800 and 2,200 of the additions will be
     traditional restaurants, with approximately two thirds outside of the
     U.S. The remainder will be satellite restaurants, about half of which
     will be in the U.S. This higher level of openings is attributable to
     our low-cost approach to restaurant development as well as the
     potential of our alliances with major oil companies and retailers.
     Based on our experience with oil alliance sites, we have determined
     that the majority of future expansion for these venues will be
     traditional restaurants rather than satellite restaurants as
     originally planned.
       The consolidated financial statements reflect the operating results
     of satellite restaurants on the same basis as traditional restaurants.
     The results of satellites operated by the Company are included in
     sales by and costs of Company-operated restaurants, while those
     operated by franchisees are included in revenues from and costs of
     franchised restaurants. Traditional restaurants opened during the year
     contributed $1,002 million to Systemwide sales in 1995, $799 million
     in 1994 and $572 million in 1993. Satellite restaurants opened during
     the year contributed $190 million to Systemwide sales in 1995 and $92
     million in 1994.

     
     TOTAL REVENUES
     Total revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and
     fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates based on
     a percent of sales with specified minimum payments. The minimum fee
     includes both a rent and service fee amount at a combined rate of
     approximately 12.5% of sales for new U.S. franchise arrangements.
     Prior to 1994, the minimum fee generally was 12.0% for rent and
     service fees combined. Fees may vary depending on the type of site and
     the investment required on the part of the Company. Fees paid by
     franchisees outside of the U.S. vary according to local business
     conditions. Together with occupancy and operating rights, these fees
     are stipulated in franchise arrangements that generally have 20-year
     terms. Accordingly, these fees provide a stable, predictable revenue
     flow to the Company.
       Revenues grow as restaurants are added and as sales build in
     existing restaurants. Menu price adjustments affect revenues and
     sales; however, different pricing structures, new products, promotions
     and product mix variations among markets make quantifying the impact
     of menu price adjustments for the System as a whole impractical.
       Total revenues for 1995 and 1994 increased due to strong global
     operating results, positive comparable sales and an increase in the
     Company-operated restaurant base through expansion and changes in
     ownership.
       In 1995, 60% of sales by Company-operated restaurants and 40% of
     revenues from franchised restaurants were outside of the U.S.,
     compared with 56% and 37%, respectively, in 1994.

     RESTAURANT MARGINS
     Company-operated restaurant margins were 19.2% of sales in 1995,
     compared with 19.8% in 1994 and 19.2% in 1993. As a percent of 1995
     sales, food and paper as well as occupancy and other operating costs
     increased, while payroll costs remained relatively flat. As a percent
     of 1994 sales, food and paper as well as occupancy and other operating
     costs declined, while payroll costs increased.
       Franchised margin dollars comprised about two thirds of the
     combined operating margins, the same as in the prior year. Franchised
     restaurant margins were 82.4% of applicable 1995 revenues, compared
     with 82.8% in 1994 and 83.1% in 1993. The decreases reflected a higher
     proportion of leased sites, resulting from accelerated expansion and
     satellite development, which have financing costs embedded in rent
     expense; whereas, financing costs for owned sites are reflected in
     interest expense.
       Franchised margins include revenues and expenses associated with
     restaurants operating under business facilities lease arrangements.
     Under these arrangements the Company leases the businesses --
     including equipment -- to franchisees who have options to purchase the
     businesses. While higher fees are charged under these arrangements,
     margins are generally lower because of equipment depreciation. When
     these purchase options are exercised, the resulting gains compensate
     the Company for the lower margins prior to exercise and are included
     in other operating (income) expense--net. At year-end 1995, 491
     restaurants were operating under such arrangements, compared with 484
     and 544 at year-end 1994 and 1993, respectively. The majority of these
     restaurants were operated outside of the U.S.

     
     GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND SELLING EXPENSES
     The 1995 and 1994 increases were primarily due to strategic global
     investment spending to support the Convenience, Value and Execution
     Strategies. The 1995 increase was also affected by stronger foreign
     currencies while the 1994 increase included a one-time, noncash $15
     million charge related to the implementation of a new accounting rule
     regarding the timing of expensing advertising production costs. These
     expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales have remained relatively
     constant and were 4.1% in 1995, 4.2% in 1994 and 4.0% in 1993.
       Corporate general, administrative and selling expenses which were
     not allocated to the geographic segments of the business were $48.2
     million in 1995, $47.6 million in 1994 and $37.7 million in 1993.

     OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE--NET
     This category is comprised of transactions that relate to franchising
     and the foodservice business such as gains on sales of restaurant
     businesses, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, and net
     gains or losses from property dispositions. The 1995 income increase
     occurred because of greater income from affiliates, principally Japan,
     partially offset by higher losses on property dispositions. The 1994
     income increase reflected higher gains on sales of restaurant
     businesses and higher income from affiliates, offset in part by higher
     losses on property dispositions.
       Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from
     exercises of purchase options by franchisees operating under business
     facilities lease arrangements and from sales of Company-operated
     restaurants. As a franchisor, McDonald's purchases and sells
     businesses in transactions with franchisees and affiliates in an
     ongoing effort to achieve the optimal ownership mix in each market.
     These transactions and resulting gains are integral to franchising,
     and as such, are recorded in operating income.
       Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is reported after
     interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. partnerships which
     are reported before income taxes. The Company actively participates
     in, but does not control, these businesses.
       Net gains or losses from property dispositions result from
     disposals of excess properties through closings, relocations and other
     transactions.

     OPERATING INCOME
     The 1995 and 1994 increases reflected higher combined operating margin
     dollars and stronger foreign currencies, partially offset by higher
     general, administrative and selling expenses. In addition, 1994
     benefited from higher other operating income.

     INTEREST EXPENSE
     The 1995 increase was due to higher average debt levels and stronger
     foreign currencies, partially offset by lower average interest rates.
     The 1994 decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates,
     partially offset by higher average debt levels and stronger foreign
     currencies.

     
     NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE)--NET
     This category includes interest income, gains and losses related to
     investments and financings, as well as miscellaneous income and
     expense. The 1995 amount included $60 million of unrealized losses
     associated with the Company's investment in Discovery Zone common
     stock. These losses were primarily responsible for the decline in 1995
     U.S. and Corporate income before provision for income taxes shown on
     page 41. Also contributing to the 1995 consolidated results were
     higher charges associated with minority interests, partially offset by
     higher interest income and lower translation losses. The 1994 decrease
     in nonoperating income reflected higher translation losses,
     principally from Mexico and Brazil, losses on investments and higher
     minority interest charges.

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
     The effective income tax rate was 34.2% for 1995, compared with 35.1%
     for 1994 and 35.4% for 1993. The 1995 decrease was primarily due to a
     reduction in U.S. state income taxes and an increased proportion of
     earnings from foreign operations. The Company expects its 1996
     effective income tax rate to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, due to
     lower taxes related to foreign operations.
       Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net
     of valuation allowance, of $308 million in 1995, and $233 million in
     1994. Substantially all tax assets arose in the U.S. and other
     profitable markets, the majority of which is expected to be realized
     in future U.S. income tax returns.

     NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
     Net income and net income per common share increased 17% each in 1995
     and 13% and 16%, respectively, in 1994. The spread between the 1994
     percent increase in net income and net income per common share
     reflected the impact of share repurchase. In 1995, the impact of share
     repurchase was offset by the conversion of 11 million shares of Series
     B and C preferred stock into 8.7 million shares of common stock.

     

     IMPACT OF CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCIES
     While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald's
     lessens short-term cash exposures principally by purchasing goods and
     services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and
     hedging foreign currency-denominated cash flows. Strengthening foreign
     currencies had a positive impact on 1995 Systemwide sales, revenues,
     operating income and net income. Strengthening foreign currencies had
     a positive impact on 1994 Systemwide sales and operating income;
     however, the currency impact on interest expense and higher
     translation losses in Latin America more than offset this benefit,
     resulting in a reduction in net income. Further discussion of our
     management of changing foreign currencies is on pages 28 and 29 in the
     commentary on financings and total shareholders' equity.

     SALES
     Restaurant expansion was primarily responsible for increasing sales in
     1995. In addition, positive comparable sales were driven by the
     Company's continued emphasis on value and customer satisfaction in the
     form of Extra Value Meals, Happy Meals and the three-tier value
     program in 1995 and 1994. Ongoing programs such as Operation Mac
     Attack -- our advertising campaign -- and Fast, Accurate and
     Friendly -- our initiative to improve customer satisfaction -- and
     promotions such as Monopoly also aided 1995 sales, as did various
     promotions in 1994.

     restaurants added globally in 1995 and 1994, compared with about half
     five years ago. Of the worldwide satellite restaurant additions, about
     two thirds were in the U.S. in 1995 and 1994.

     *Operating income prior to 1995 has been restated to reflect a more
      meaningful allocation of general, administrative and selling
      expenses between the U.S. and international segments and includes an
      additional corporate category which is not allocated.

     U.S. revenues were positively impacted by expansion and positive
     comparable sales in 1995, 1994 and 1993, and reduced by the
     franchising of certain Company-operated restaurant businesses in 1992
     and 1991.
       U.S. Company-operated margins decreased $3 million in 1995, as
     lower Company-operated comparable sales and higher costs more than
     offset the positive impact of the growth in the number of Company-
     operated restaurants. These margins were 17.7% of sales in 1995,
     compared with 19.0% in 1994 and 18.3% in 1993. In 1995, the margin
     decline was driven by higher payroll costs as a percent of sales
     resulting from an increase in the average hourly wage rate and
     increased staffing levels designed to improve customer satisfaction.
     In 1995 and 1994, the margin benefited from cost reduction efforts and
     lower commodity costs.

     
       U.S. franchised margins rose $109 million or 8% in 1995, driven by
     expansion and positive comparable sales. These margins were 82.6% of
     applicable revenues in 1995, compared with 83.2% in 1994 and 83.6% in
     1993. Franchised margins as a percent of revenues declined in 1995 and
     1994 as the growth in rent expense, resulting from an increase in the
     proportion of new leased sites, particularly satellite locations,
     outpaced the growth in franchised revenues.
       With the current intensely competitive U.S. operating environment,
     we expect continuing pressure on Company-operated margins. However,
     while it is difficult to assess the potential effects of legislation
     and other factors that may affect the industry, the Company believes
     it can maintain annual operating margins as a percent of sales within
     the historical range of the past ten years by continuing to build
     sales and reduce costs.
       U.S. operating income rose $35 million or 3% in 1995 and $61
     million or 5% in 1994, and was 48% and 54% of consolidated operating
     income in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The 1995 and 1994 increases
     resulted primarily from higher combined operating margins, partially
     offset by higher general, administrative and selling expenses in the
     form of higher employee costs, and other expenditures to support our
     Convenience, Value and Execution Strategies. 1994 U.S. operating
     income was also impacted by a one-time, $12 million charge related to
     the implementation of a new accounting rule for advertising costs.
     Operating income included depreciation and amortization of $398
     million in 1995, $366 million in 1994 and $348 million in 1993.
       While the U.S. market remains intensely competitive, McDonald's is
     confident of continued growth in operating income over the long term
     through expansion, by controlling costs at the developmental,
     operational and administrative levels, and through a greater emphasis
     on value and customer satisfaction.

     ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     U.S. assets increased $547 million or 8% in 1995 and $293 million or
     5% in 1994. These increases were due to accelerated expansion and
     increased reinvestment in existing restaurants during 1995. At year-
     end 1995, 46% of consolidated assets were located in the U.S.,
     compared with 48% at year-end 1994.

     =========================================================================

     
       U.S. capital expenditures increased $209 million or 30% in 1995,
     and represented 44% of consolidated capital expenditures, compared
     with 47% five years ago. These amounts excluded initial investments
     made by franchisees in equipment, signs, seating and decor, as well as
     their ongoing reinvestment expenditures. New restaurant expenditures
     increased $130 million or 28%, primarily because of accelerated
     expansion.
       Expenditures for existing restaurants were made to achieve higher
     levels of customer satisfaction and implement technology to improve
     service and food quality. In 1995, strategic reinvestment to build
     sales included $57 million for indoor Ronald's Playplaces and $37
     million for rebuilding and relocating restaurants to adjust to
     changing demographics, traffic patterns and market opportunities. Over
     the past five years, $188 million has been invested to replace older
     buildings with new lower-cost, more efficient restaurants.
       Other properties primarily included expenditures for office
     buildings and related furnishings.

     =========================================================================

       U.S. average development costs increased in 1995 primarily due to
     higher site development and preparation costs combined with
     investments for indoor Ronald's Playplaces in more than 25% of new
     traditional restaurants. Construction efficiencies and a further shift
     toward smaller, lower-cost building designs partially offset these
     increases.
       Average development costs have decreased 26% from 1990 levels.
     Initiatives such as the Company's new joint venture to develop modular
     restaurant buildings serve as an example of our commitment to further
     reduce development costs through standardization, global sourcing and
     greater economies of scale. Our objective is to profitably expand into
     more locations, consistent with McDonald's goal of increasing market
     share with greater marketwide presence throughout the world.
       Because real estate ownership yields long-term benefits, including
     the ability to fix occupancy costs, the Company purchases new
     properties and acquires previously leased properties to the extent
     practical. The Company owned 68% of traditional U.S. sites at year-end
     1995, compared with 69% five years ago. Most satellite restaurants are
     leased locations.

     OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     SALES
     Sales outside of the U.S. rose 27% in 1995 and 18% in 1994 due to
     aggressive expansion, stronger foreign currencies and higher local
     currency sales at existing restaurants in all geographic segments
     except Canada. This strong sales growth in 1995 was achieved despite
     weak economies in several markets. In 1995, 47% of Systemwide sales
     were from markets located outside of the U.S. compared with 43% in
     1994 and 35% five years ago.

       In Latin America, due to the mid-1994 economic reforms, Brazil's
     tremendous sales growth continued into 1995. Results in Mexico
     continued to be impacted by the weak economy and further peso
     devaluation. We currently anticipate this trend to continue through at
     least 1996; however, we believe this market offers long-term
     potential.
       Canada's 1995 sales growth was impacted by a slow economy and
     decreased consumer retail spending.
       Average sales by total restaurants outside of the U.S. open at
     least one year were $2,422,000 in 1995 and $2,254,000 in 1994. This
     increase reflected stronger foreign currencies and higher local
     currency sales.

     RESTAURANTS
     During the past five years, 56% of Systemwide and 64% of traditional
     restaurant additions have been outside of the U.S. Of the 1,007
     traditional restaurants added outside of the U.S. in 1995, 42% were in
     the six largest markets -- Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany
     and Japan -- compared with 51% in 1994. Of the 293 satellite
     restaurants added in 1995, 86% were in the six largest markets
     compared with 74% in 1994.

     
       In 1995, Japan added 313 total restaurants (109 traditional and 204
     satellites), representing 24% of the total restaurants added outside
     of the U.S. Japan's profitable expansion was supported by significant
     reductions in average restaurant development costs achieved through
     standardization of building designs and utilization of smaller
     buildings.
       In 1996 and 1997, more than half of total restaurant additions
     outside of the U.S. are anticipated to be in the six largest markets
     while new and emerging markets, such as the Middle East, China and
     Central Europe are expected to represent a growing proportion of
     expansion.

       At year-end 1995, 38% of Systemwide restaurants were outside of the
     U.S. compared with 36% in 1994 and 27% five years ago. Restaurants
     outside of the U.S. comprised 53% of traditional Company-operated
     restaurants and 27% of traditional franchised restaurants. About 29%
     of the traditional restaurants outside of the U.S. were Company-
     operated, 47% were franchised and 24% were operated by affiliates.
     Approximately 69% of traditional Company-operated restaurants were in
     England, Canada, Germany, Australia, Taiwan and Brazil. About 66% of
     traditional franchised restaurants were in Canada, Germany, Australia,
     France, England and the Netherlands. Restaurants operated by
     affiliates were principally located in Japan and other Asia/Pacific
     countries.
       Approximately 81% of satellite restaurants outside of the U.S. were
     operated by franchisees and affiliates at year-end 1995. The vast
     majority were located in Japan, Canada and Brazil.

       The growth in 1995 and 1994 revenue and operating income was driven
     by higher combined operating margin dollars resulting from expansion,
     positive comparable sales and stronger foreign currencies. The six
     largest markets accounted for about 75% of total operating income
     outside of the U.S. in 1995 and contributed 70% to operating income
     growth outside of the U.S. in 1995 compared with 53% in 1994.

     
       Operations outside of the U.S. continued to contribute greater
     amounts to consolidated results as shown below:

       Company-operated margins increased $172 million or 26% in 1995.
     Company-operated margins accounted for 53% of the total operating
     income increase outside of the U.S. in 1995 and 55% of this increase
     in 1994. The six largest markets contributed about 68% to total
     Company-operated margin dollars outside of the U.S. in 1995 and
     accounted for 46% of the increase over 1994.
       Company-operated margins declined as a percent of sales in 1995 to
     20.2% compared with 20.5% in 1994 and 20.1% in 1993. The 1995 decline
     resulted from a strategic decision to invest incremental margin
     dollars into our Value Strategy, designed to increase market share and
     customer satisfaction, coupled with a comparison to extremely strong
     results in the second half of 1994, primarily due to Brazil. The
     Company believes it can maintain these annual operating margins as a
     percent of sales within the historical range of the past ten years by
     continuing to build sales and reduce costs.
       Franchised margins grew $213 million or 28% in 1995. These margins
     were 82.1% of applicable revenues in 1995 and 1994 compared with 82.0%
     in 1993. Franchised margin dollar growth was driven by expansion and
     positive comparable sales.
       The 1995 and 1994 increases in general, administrative and selling
     expenses were caused principally by additional employee costs
     associated with rapid expansion in new and emerging markets,
     government-mandated payroll and social cost increases and stronger
     foreign currencies.
       Other operating income increased in 1995 primarily due to higher
     income from affiliates, principally Japan. Japan's increased income
     resulted from expansion as well as an aggressive value strategy
     emphasizing Extra Value Meals which resulted in strong comparable
     sales.

     
       The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment accounted for 61% of revenues
     and 60% of operating income outside of the U.S. in 1995, growing $650
     and $195 million, respectively in 1995 and $369 and $113 million,
     respectively, in 1994. Germany, England and France accounted for 83%
     of this segment's operating income in 1995, compared with 82% in 1994.
     Stronger currencies contributed about one third of this segment's
     operating income increase over 1994. This benefit diminished as the
     U.S. Dollar strengthened later in 1995.
       Asia/Pacific revenues grew $280 and $236 million and operating
     income increased $76 and $53 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan contributed 86% of this
     segment's operating income in 1995. Japan's profits increased
     significantly compared to 1994 due to an aggressive value campaign and
     accelerated expansion. Australia experienced strong sales increases in
     1995 from significant restaurant expansion and higher sales at
     existing restaurants through a continued emphasis on value. The
     Company's share of Taiwan's 1995 and 1994 revenues increased as a
     result of a change in ownership from a joint venture to a wholly-owned
     subsidiary in May 1994. The 1994 increases in revenues and operating
     income were also attributable to expansion and developing economies in
     many markets, with the exception of Japan, which suffered from a weak
     economy. Strong currencies contributed to this segment's 1995
     operating income increase. As the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the
     Yen in the later part of the year, the currency benefit significantly
     decreased.
       Latin American revenues grew $223 and $95 million and operating
     income increased $57 and $35 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     Brazil continued to be primarily responsible for the Latin American
     operating income increase due to expansion as well as significant
     sales increases from existing restaurants which began in mid-1994 due
     to economic reforms. Brazil's restaurant base grew by 25% in 1995 and
     27% in 1994. Mexico continued to be negatively impacted by the economy
     and currency devaluation.
       Canadian revenues increased $2 million in 1995 and decreased $12
     million in 1994, while operating income decreased $2 million in 1995
     and increased $6 million in 1994. The 1995 results reflect lower sales
     at existing restaurants, caused by the slow economy, partially offset
     by new restaurant growth.

     
     ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Assets outside of the U.S. rose $1.3 billion or 19% in 1995 due to
     expansion and stronger foreign currencies. At year-end 1995, about 53%
     of consolidated assets were located outside of the U.S.; 57% of these
     assets were located in England, Germany, France, Australia and Canada.

     =======================================================================

       In the past five years, $4.2 billion has been invested by the
     Company outside of the U.S. Capital expenditures outside of the U.S.
     rose $294 million or 35% in 1995 reflecting growth in all geographic
     segments. Approximately 66% of 1995 capital expenditures outside of
     the U.S. were invested in Europe -- primarily in Germany, France and
     England.
       Overall average development costs for new restaurants for the five
     largest, majority-owned markets -- Australia, Canada, England, France
     and Germany -- were nearly double the U.S. average. These investments
     accommodate higher sales volumes and transaction counts. Since 1990,
     average development costs have decreased due to construction and
     design efficiencies, standardization, global sourcing and changes in
     the mix of openings.
       Expenditures for existing restaurants included dining room remodels
     to achieve increased levels of customer satisfaction and technology
     upgrades to improve service and food quality. The majority of these
     expenditures were in Europe. Expenditures for other properties were
     principally for office facilities.
       As in the U.S., the Company emphasizes restaurant property
     ownership outside of the U.S.; however, various laws and regulations
     make property acquisition and ownership much more difficult. Property
     is purchased when legally and economically feasible; otherwise, long-
     term leases are an alternative. In addition, certain markets have laws
     and customs that offer stronger tenancy rights than are available in
     the U.S. The Company owned 34% of traditional sites outside of the
     U.S. at year-end 1995, compared with 36% in 1994 and 35% five years
     ago.
       Capital expenditures made by affiliates -- which were not included
     in consolidated amounts -- were $258 million in 1995, compared with
     $203 million in 1994. The majority of the 1995 expenditures were for
     development in Japan, Sweden, Argentina, Russia and Singapore.

     FINANCIAL POSITION
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     TOTAL ASSETS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
     Total assets grew approximately $1.8 billion or 13% in 1995; net
     property and equipment represented 83% of total assets and rose $1.5
     billion. Capital expenditures increased $503 million or 32%,
     reflecting increased expansion, reinvestment in existing restaurants
     and stronger foreign currencies.

     ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
     In the first quarter of 1996, the Company will adopt Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment
     of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. This
     statement requires impairment losses be recognized for long-lived
     assets, whether these assets are held for disposal or continue to be
     used in operations, when indicators of impairment are present and the
     fair value of assets are estimated to be less than carrying amounts.
     After reviewing its assets for impairment, the Company anticipates a
     pre-tax charge to operating income of approximately $16 million
     related to restaurant sites in Mexico on adoption of this new
     accounting standard.

     CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS
     Cash provided by operations increased $370 million or 19% in 1995, and
     $246 million or 15% in 1994. Together with other sources of cash such
     as borrowings, cash provided by operations was used principally for
     capital expenditures, debt repayments, share repurchase and dividends.
     For the fifth consecutive year, cash provided by operations exceeded
     capital expenditures.
       While cash generated is significant relative to cash required, the
     Company also has the ability to meet any short-term needs through
     commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.
     Accordingly, a relatively low current ratio has been purposefully
     maintained; it was .53 at year-end 1995.
       The Company believes that cash flow measures are meaningful
     indicators of growth and financial strength, when evaluated in the
     context of absolute dollars, uses and consistency. Cash provided by
     operations is expected to cover capital expenditures over the next
     several years, even as expansion continues to accelerate.

     FINANCINGS
     The Company strives to minimize interest expense and the impact of
     changing foreign currencies while maintaining the capacity to meet
     increasing growth requirements. To accomplish these objectives,
     McDonald's generally finances long-term assets with long-term debt in
     the currencies in which the assets are denominated, while remaining
     flexible to take advantage of changing foreign currencies and interest
     rates.
       Over the years, major capital markets and various techniques have
     been utilized to meet financing requirements and reduce interest
     expense. Currency exchange agreements have been employed in
     conjunction with borrowings to obtain desired currencies at attractive
     rates. Interest-rate exchange agreements have been used to effectively
     convert fixed-rate to floating-rate debt, or vice versa. Foreign
     currency-denominated debt has been used to lessen the impact of
     changing foreign currencies on net income and shareholders' equity by
     designating these borrowings as hedges of intercompany financings or
     the Company's long-term investments in its foreign subsidiaries and
     affiliates. Total foreign currency-denominated debt, including the
     effects of currency exchange agreements, was $4.3 and $4.0 billion at
     year-end 1995 and 1994, respectively.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Company manages its debt portfolio to respond to changes in
     interest rates and foreign currencies and accordingly, periodically
     retires, redeems, and repurchases debt; terminates exchange
     agreements; and uses derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives
     with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to
     be hedged and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
     purposes; all exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments.

     
       While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, the
     Company actively hedges selected foreign currencies, primarily to
     minimize the cash exposure of royalty and other payments received in
     the U.S. in local currencies. McDonald's restaurants also primarily
     purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural
     hedges and McDonald's typically finances in local currencies creating
     economic hedges. The Company's exposure is diversified within a broad
     basket of currencies. At year-end 1995, assets in hyperinflationary
     markets and in Mexico were principally financed in U.S. Dollars. The
     Company's largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency
     assets less foreign currency liabilities) by foreign currency were as
     follows:

       Moody's and Standard & Poor's have rated McDonald's debt Aa2 and
     AA, respectively, since 1982. Duff & Phelps began rating the debt in
     1990, and currently rates it AA+. At the present time, these strong
     ratings are important to McDonald's in the context of our global
     development plans. The Company has not experienced, nor does it expect
     to experience, difficulty in obtaining financing or in refinancing
     existing debt. At year-end 1995, the Company and its subsidiaries had
     $1.3 billion available under line of credit agreements and $785
     million under previously filed shelf registrations available for
     future debt issuance.
       Although McDonald's prefers to own real estate, leases are an
     alternative financing method. As in the past, some new properties will
     be leased. Such leases frequently include renewal and/or purchase
     options. In the past five years, the Company and its affiliates have
     leased properties related to 40% of U.S. traditional restaurant
     openings and 66% of traditional restaurant openings outside of the
     U.S.
       Since 1990, the Company has improved its balance sheet by reducing
     leverage while simultaneously increasing expansion and repurchasing
     shares.

     
     TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
     Total shareholders' equity rose $976 million or 14% in 1995,
     representing 51% of total assets at year-end. Stronger foreign
     currencies increased shareholders' equity by $28 million in 1995.
       One technique used to enhance common shareholder value is share
     repurchase using excess cash flow or debt capacity, while maintaining
     a strong equity base for future expansion. McDonald's has repurchased
     $2.8 billion of its common stock, representing 148 million shares,
     over the past 10 years. At year-end 1995, the market value of shares
     recorded as common stock in treasury was $6.3 billion, compared to the
     cost of $2.5 billion.
       In January 1996, the Company announced plans to repurchase $2.2
     billion of its common stock within the next three years, including
     $200 million remaining under the three-year, $1 billion program
     announced in January 1994. In 1993, the Company completed a $700
     million common share repurchase program begun in 1992.

     RETURNS
     Return on average assets is computed using operating income. Net
     income less preferred stock dividends (net of tax in 1995, 1994, 1993
     and 1992) is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-
     end balances are used to compute both average assets and average
     common equity.


     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    1995    1994     1993     1992     1991
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Return on average assets       17.9%   17.6%    17.0%    16.4%    15.7%
     Return on average common
       equity                       19.9    19.4     19.0     18.2     19.1
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

       The improvements in return on average assets since 1991 reflected
     better global operating results and a slower rate of asset growth. The
     1995, 1994 and 1993 improvements in return on average common equity
     reflected higher levels of share repurchase, whereas the decline in
     1992 resulted from a lower level of share repurchase as excess cash
     flow was used to reduce debt.

     EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES--INFLATION
     McDonald's has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost
     increases effectively. Rapid inventory turnover, ability to adjust
     prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings -- many of
     which are at fixed costs and partially financed by debt made cheaper
     by inflation -- have enabled McDonald's to mitigate the effects of
     inflation. In hyperinflationary markets, menu board prices typically
     are adjusted to keep pace, thereby mitigating the effect on reported
     results.

     MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

     Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair
     presentation of the consolidated financial statements and Financial
     Comments appearing in this annual report. The financial statements
     were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
     principles and include certain amounts based on management's judgment
     and best estimates. Other financial information presented in the
     annual report is consistent with the financial statements.
       The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
     reporting including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized
     acquisition, use or disposition, which is designed to provide
     reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of
     Directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial
     statements and such asset safeguarding. The system includes a
     documented organizational structure and appropriate division of
     responsibilities; established policies and procedures which are
     communicated throughout the Company; careful selection, training, and
     development of our people; and utilization of an internal audit
     program. Policies and procedures prescribe that the Company and all
     employees are to maintain the highest ethical standards and that
     business practices throughout the world are to be conducted in a
     manner which is above reproach.
       There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system
     of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the
     circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an
     effective internal control system can provide only reasonable
     assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
     safeguarding of assets. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal
     control system can change with circumstances. The Company believes
     that at December 31, 1995, it maintained an effective system of
     internal control over financial reporting and safeguarding of assets
     against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition.
       The consolidated financial statements have been audited by
     independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, who were given unrestricted
     access to all financial records and related data. The audit report of
     Ernst & Young LLP is presented below.
       The Board of Directors, operating through its Audit Committee
     composed entirely of independent Directors, provides oversight to the
     financial reporting process. Ernst & Young LLP has independent access
     to the Audit Committee and periodically meets with the Committee to
     discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     The Board of Directors and Shareholders
     McDonald's Corporation
     Oak Brook, Illinois

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
     McDonald's Corporation as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
     related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
     cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
     31, 1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of
     McDonald's Corporation management. Our responsibility is to express an
     opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
       We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
     auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
     the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
     statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
     disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
     assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
     made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
     reasonable basis for our opinion.
       In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
     fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
     of McDonald's Corporation at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
     consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
     the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity
     with generally accepted accounting principles.

     MCDONALD'S CORPORATION FINANCIAL COMMENTS

     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
     Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates, in which the
     Company owns 50% or less, are carried at equity in the companies' net
     assets.

     ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
     and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
     liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
     date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
     and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
     from those estimates.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
     The functional currency of substantially all operations outside of the
     U.S. is the respective local currency, except for hyperinflationary
     countries where it is the U.S. Dollar.

     ADVERTISING COSTS
     Production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed as
     of the date the commercials are initially aired. Advertising expenses
     included in costs of Company-operated restaurants and general,
     administrative and selling expenses were (in millions): 1995--$431.0;
     1994--$385.6; 1993--$353.8.

     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
     In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
     Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which is
     effective in 1996. As permitted by the new standard, the Company will
     continue applying accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 and
     include additional footnote disclosures.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
     Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and
     amortization provided on the straight-line method over the following
     estimated useful lives: buildings--up to 40 years; leasehold
     improvements--lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms
     including option periods; and equipment--3 to 12 years.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS
     Intangible assets, consisting primarily of franchise rights reacquired
     from franchisees and affiliates, are amortized on the straight-line
     method over an average life of 30 years.

     
     ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
     In the first quarter of 1996, the Company will adopt Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment
     of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. This
     statement requires impairment losses be recognized for long-lived
     assets, whether these assets are held for disposal or continue to be
     used in operations, when indicators of impairment are present and the
     fair value of assets are estimated to be less than carrying amounts.
     After reviewing its assets, the Company anticipates a pre-tax charge
     to operating income of approximately $16 million related to restaurant
     sites in Mexico on adoption of this new accounting standard.

     FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     The Company utilizes derivatives in managing risk, but not for trading
     purposes. Non-U.S. Dollar financing transactions generally are
     effective as hedges of either long-term investments in or intercompany
     loans to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Foreign currency gains
     and losses on the hedges of long-term investments are recorded as
     foreign currency translation adjustment included in shareholders'
     equity. Gains and losses related to hedges of intercompany loans
     offset the gains and losses on intercompany loans and are recorded in
     nonoperating income (expense).
       Interest-rate exchange agreements are designated and effective to
     modify the Company's interest-rate exposures. Net interest is accrued
     as either interest receivable or payable with the offset recorded in
     interest expense. Gains or losses from the early termination of
     interest rate swaps are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense
     over the shorter of the remaining life of the swap or the underlying
     debt being hedged.
       The Company also purchases foreign currency options (with little or
     no intrinsic value) to hedge future foreign currency-denominated
     royalty and other payments received in the U.S. The premiums paid for
     these options are amortized over the option life and are recorded in
     nonoperating expense. Any realized gains on exercised options are
     deferred and amortized over the period being hedged.
       Short-term forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to
     mitigate exposure on foreign currency-denominated cash flows received
     from affiliates and subsidiaries. These contracts are marked to market
     with the resulting gains or losses recorded in nonoperating income
     (expense). Gains and losses associated with these forward contracts
     have not been material.
       If a hedged item matures or is extinguished, the associated
     derivative is marked to market with the resulting gain or loss
     recognized immediately. The derivative then is redesignated as a hedge
     of some other item or terminated.
       The carrying amounts for cash and equivalents and notes receivable
     approximated fair value. No fair value was provided for noninterest-
     bearing security deposits by franchisees as these deposits are an
     integral part of the overall franchise arrangements.

     STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
     The Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments to be cash
     equivalents. The impact of changing foreign currencies on cash and
     equivalents was not material.

     

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     NUMBER OF RESTAURANTS IN OPERATION
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company, its franchisees and affiliates operate traditional and
     satellite restaurants. Satellite restaurants generally offer a
     simplified menu and are smaller in size and sales volume compared to
     traditional restaurants.

     its Hong Kong subsidiary. The results of operations of restaurant
     businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees and
     affiliates were not material to the consolidated financial statements
     for periods prior to purchase and sale.

     Gains on sales of restaurant businesses are recognized as income when
     the sales are consummated and other stipulated conditions are met.
     Proceeds from certain sales of restaurant businesses and property
     include notes receivable. The 1995 increase in equity in earnings of
     unconsolidated affiliates occurred because of greater income from
     affiliates, principally Japan.

     which are considered to be permanently invested in the businesses. If
     these earnings were not considered permanently invested, any
     incremental taxes that may need to be provided would not be material.

     SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company operates exclusively in the foodservice industry.
     Substantially all revenues result from the sale of menu products at
     restaurants operated by the Company, franchisees or affiliates.
     Operating income includes the Company's share of operating results of
     affiliates. All intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in
     computing revenues and operating income. Fees received from
     subsidiaries outside of the U.S. were (in millions): 1995--$358.4;
     1994--$268.9; 1993--$202.8.
       Segment operating income has been restated to reflect a more
     meaningful allocation of general, administrative and selling expenses
     between the U.S. and international segments and includes an additional
     corporate category. In addition, segment assets have been restated to
     reflect an additional corporate category, primarily comprised of
     corporate cash, investments, asset portions of financing instruments
     and certain intangibles.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     DEBT FINANCING
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS
     Effective April 19, 1995, the Company canceled its existing $700.0
     million line of credit agreement and entered into a new $675.0 million
     five-year revolving credit agreement with various banks. Accordingly,
     $675.0 million of notes maturing within one year have been
     reclassified as long-term debt. In June 1995, the Company entered into
     an additional $25.0 million revolving credit agreement with various
     banks for a renewable term of 364 days. Both agreements, which
     remained unused at December 31, 1995, provide for fees of .07% per
     annum on the total commitment. Each borrowing under the agreements
     bears interest at one of several specified floating rates selected by
     the Company at the time of borrowing. In addition, certain
     subsidiaries outside of the U.S. had unused lines of credit totaling
     $550.5 million at December 31, 1995; these were principally short-term
     and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of
     interest. The weighted average interest rates of short-term
     borrowings, comprised of commercial paper and foreign-denominated bank
     line borrowings, were 6.4% and 6.8% at December 31, 1995, and 1994,
     respectively.

     
     EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS
     The Company has entered into agreements for the exchange of various
     currencies, certain of which also provide for the periodic exchange of
     interest payments. These agreements, as well as additional interest-
     rate exchange agreements, expire through 2003. The interest-rate
     exchange agreements had a notional amount with a U.S. Dollar
     equivalent of $1.6 billion at December 31, 1995, and were denominated
     primarily in U.S. Dollars, Japanese Yen, Deutsche Marks and British
     Pounds Sterling. The net value of each exchange agreement was
     classified as an asset or liability based on its carrying amount, and
     any related interest income was netted against interest expense.
       The counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group
     of financial institutions. The Company continually monitors its
     positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties, and adjusts
     positions as appropriate. The Company does not have a significant
     exposure to any individual counterparty, and has entered into master
     agreements that contain netting arrangements.
       The Company purchased foreign currency options which were
     outstanding at December 31, 1995, with a notional amount equivalent to
     U.S. $187.7 million in various currencies, primarily Deutsche Marks,
     British Pounds Sterling and French Francs. At December 31, 1995, the
     unamortized premium related to these currency options was $4.9
     million. There were no deferred gains related to these options at year
     end. Short-term forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at
     December 31, 1995, had a U.S. Dollar equivalent of $27.6 million in
     various currencies, primarily Deutsche Marks, Japanese Yen and Swiss
     Francs.

     GUARANTEES
     The Company has guaranteed and included in total debt at December 31,
     1995, $146.7 million of 7.4% ESOP Notes Series A and $77.1 million of
     7.1% ESOP Notes Series B issued by the Leveraged Employee Stock
     Ownership Plan with payments through 2004 and 2006, respectively.
     Interest rates on the notes were adjusted in 1995 due to refinancing
     of certain sinking fund payments. The Company has agreed to repurchase
     the notes upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company also has
     guaranteed certain foreign affiliate loans totaling $60.6 million at
     December 31, 1995.
       The Company was a general partner in 92 domestic partnerships with
     total assets of $407.9 million and total liabilities of $232.5 million
     at December 31, 1995.

     Short-term forward foreign exchange contracts were recorded at their
     fair value of $27.6 million at December 31, 1995. The fair value of
     the debt and notes payable obligations (excluding capital leases), the
     currency and interest-rate exchange agreements, and the foreign
     currency options was estimated using quoted market prices, various
     pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses. The Company has no
     current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to
     maturity. Given the market value of its common stock and its
     significant real estate holdings, the Company believes that the fair
     value of total assets was higher than their carrying value at December
     31, 1995.

     DEBT OBLIGATIONS
     The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public
     and private offerings and bank loans. The terms of most debt
     obligations contain restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages
     and long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements,
     the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at
     par or at a premium over par. The following table summarizes these
     debt obligations, including the gross effects of currency and
     interest-rate exchange agreements.

     LEASING ARRANGEMENTS
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     At December 31, 1995, the Company was lessee at 2,976 locations under
     ground leases (the Company leases land and constructs and owns
     buildings) and at 4,204 locations under improved leases (lessor owns
     land and buildings). Land and building lease terms for most
     traditional restaurants are generally for 20 to 25 years and, in many
     cases, provide for rent escalations and one or more five-year renewal
     options with certain leases providing purchase options. Most satellite
     restaurants operate under improved leases which generally include
     percentage rent payments only and are of a shorter term. For most
     locations, the Company is obligated for the related occupancy costs
     which include property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition,
     the Company is lessee under noncancelable leases covering offices and
     vehicles.
       Future minimum payments required under operating leases with
     initial terms of one year or more are:

     Franchise arrangements include a lease and a license and generally
     provide for initial fees as well as continuing rent and service fee
     payments to the Company, based upon a percentage of sales with minimum
     rent payments. Franchisees are granted the right to operate a
     McDonald's restaurant using the McDonald's system. Additionally,
     franchisees are provided the use of a restaurant facility generally
     for a period of 20 years. They are required to pay related occupancy
     costs which include property taxes, insurance, maintenance and a
     refundable, noninterest-bearing security deposit. On a limited basis
     the Company accepts notes from franchisees which generally are secured

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company has a program for U.S. employees which includes profit
     sharing, 401(k) (McDESOP), and leveraged employee stock ownership
     (LESOP) features. McDESOP allows participants to make contributions
     which are partially matched by the Company. Profit sharing assets and
     contributions made by McDESOP participants can be invested in
     McDonald's common stock or among several other investment
     alternatives. Company contributions to McDESOP are invested in
     McDonald's common stock. Due to the conversion of all remaining
     preferred shares in 1995, the LESOP is now invested only in McDonald's
     common stock.
       Staff, executives and restaurant managers participate in profit
     sharing contributions and shares released under the LESOP based on
     participant's compensation. The profit sharing contribution is
     discretionary, and the amount is determined by the Company each year.
     The LESOP contribution is based on the loan payments necessary to
     amortize the debt initially incurred to acquire the stock. Shares held
     by the LESOP are allocated to participants as the loan is repaid.
     Dividends on shares held by the LESOP are used to service the debt,
     and shares are released to participants to replace the dividends on
     shares that have been allocated to them. LESOP costs shown in the
     following table were based upon the cash paid for loan payments less
     these dividends.

       Certain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. also offer profit sharing,
     stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. Total plan costs
     outside of the U.S. were (in millions): 1995  $26.6 1994--$18.1;
     1993--$13.0.
       Profit sharing costs were restated to reflect a more meaningful
     allocation of program costs between the U.S. and outside of the U.S.
     segments. The Company does not provide any other postretirement
     benefits, and postemployment benefits were immaterial.

     STOCK OPTIONS
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     At December 31, 1995, the Company had three stock-based compensation
     plans which were accounted for under APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly,
     no compensation cost has been recognized in the consolidated financial
     statements for these plans because options to purchase common stock
     are granted at prices not less than the fair market value of the stock
     on date of grant.
       Substantially all of the options under these plans become
     exercisable in four equal biennial installments, commencing one year
     from date of grant, and expire ten years from date of grant. At
     December 31, 1995, 105.1 and 37.0 million shares of common stock were
     reserved for issuance and for future grants, respectively, under these
     plans.

     at December 31      24.4    21.4    17.6
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Options granted during each year were 1.96%, 1.94% and 1.69% of
     average common shares outstanding for 1995, 1994 and 1993,
     respectively. Stock options were granted to approximately 8,500, 7,700
     and 6,800 employees in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Shares are
     issued from treasury stock to employees upon exercise of stock
     options.
       The potential dilution of common shares outstanding upon exercise
     of stock options shown in the following table represents the number of
     common shares issuable upon exercise less the number of common shares
     that could be repurchased with proceeds from the exercise, based upon
     the respective December 31 prices of the Company's common stock. As
     such, this potential dilution was 2.9%, 1.6% and 1.8% of shares
     outstanding at year-end 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

          As shown above, the average option exercise price has
     consistently exceeded the average cost of treasury stock issued for
     option exercises because of the Company's practice of prefunding the
     program through share repurchase. As a result, stock option exercises
     have generated additional capital, as cash received from employees has
     exceeded the Company's average acquisition cost of treasury stock.

     CAPITAL STOCK

     PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION
     Income used in the computation of per common share information was
     reduced by preferred stock cash dividends (net of tax benefits). In
     1995, it was also reduced by $3.9 million for the one-time effect of
     the Company's offer to exchange its Series E 7.72% Cumulative
     Preferred Stock for subordinated debt securities completed on June 30,
     1995, and by an additional $.4 million for the effect of the Company's
     repurchase of additional Series E preferred stock in the third
     quarter. Adjusted net income was divided by the weighted average
     shares of common stock outstanding during each year (in millions):
     1995--701.5; 1994--701.8; 1993--711.8. Including the effect of
     potentially dilutive securities, fully diluted earnings per common
     share amounts and increases were: 1995--$1.92, 18%; 1994--$1.63, 16%;
     1993--$1.41, 12%.

     PREFERRED STOCK
     In December 1992, the Company issued $500.0 million of Series E 7.72%
     Cumulative Preferred Stock; 10,000 preferred shares are equivalent to
     20.0 million depositary shares having a liquidation preference of
     $25.00 per depositary share. Each preferred share is entitled to one
     vote under certain circumstances and is redeemable at the option of
     the Company beginning on December 3, 1997, at its liquidation
     preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends. On June 30, 1995, the
     Company completed an exchange of approximately 5.2 million depositary
     shares, representing 2,600 shares of Series E 7.72% Cumulative
     Preferred Stock, for subordinated debt securities. In the third
     quarter of 1995, the Company repurchased approximately .5 million
     depositary shares equivalent to 250 shares of Series E 7.72%
     Cumulative Preferred Stock.
       In September 1989 and April 1991, the Company sold $200.0 million
     of Series B and $100.0 million of Series C ESOP Convertible Preferred
     Stock to the LESOP. The LESOP financed the purchase by issuing notes
     which are guaranteed by the Company and are included in long-term
     debt, with an offsetting reduction in shareholders' equity. Each
     preferred share had a liquidation preference of $14.375 and $16.5625,
     respectively, and was convertible to a minimum of .7692 and .8 common
     share (conversion rate), respectively. Upon termination of employment,
     employees were guaranteed a minimum value payable in common shares
     equal to the greater of the conversion rate; the fair market value of
     their preferred shares; or the liquidation preference plus accrued
     dividends, not to exceed one common share. Each preferred share was
     entitled to one vote and was redeemable at the option of the Company.
     In 1992, 8.2 million Series B shares were converted into 6.4 million
     common shares. During 1995, the remaining 5.2 million Series B shares
     and 5.8 million Series C shares were converted into 8.7 million common
     shares.

     
     COMMON EQUITY PUT OPTIONS
     During May and June 1995, the Company sold 1.5 million common equity
     put options which expired unexercised in August and September. In
     August 1995, the Company sold .5 million common equity put options of
     which .4 million were exercised and .1 million expired unexercised in
     October 1995.
       In June 1994, the Company sold 2.0 million common equity put
     options which were exercised in November 1994. During November and
     December 1994, the Company sold an additional 2.0 million common
     equity put options which expired unexercised in February 1995. At
     December 31, 1994, the $56.2 million exercise price of these options
     was classified in common equity put options and the related offset was
     recorded in common stock in treasury, net of premiums received.
       In April 1993, 2.0 million common equity put options issued by the
     Company in December 1992, having an exercise price of $94.0 million,
     expired unexercised. In April 1993, the Company also sold 1.0 million
     common equity put options which expired unexercised in July 1993.

     SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
     In December 1988, the Company declared a dividend of one Preferred
     Share Purchase Right (Right) on each outstanding share of common
     stock. Under certain conditions, each Right may be exercised to
     purchase one four-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
     Participating Preferred Stock (the economic equivalent of one common
     share) at an exercise price of $62.50 (which may be adjusted under
     certain circumstances), and is transferable apart from the common
     stock ten days following a public announcement that a person or group
     has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
     common shares (which threshold may be reduced by the Board of
     Directors to as low as 10%), or ten business days following the
     commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender or
     exchange offer resulting in beneficial ownership by a person or group
     exceeding the threshold.
       Once the threshold has been exceeded, or if the Company is acquired
     in a merger or other business combination transaction, each Right will
     entitle the holder, other than such person or group, to purchase at
     the then current exercise price, stock of the Company or the acquiring
     company having a market value of twice the exercise price.
       Each Right is nonvoting and expires on December 28, 1998, unless
     redeemed by the Company, at a price of $.0025, at any time prior to
     the public announcement that a person or group has exceeded the
     threshold. At December 31, 1995, 2.1 million shares of the Series A
     Junior Participating Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance under
     this plan.
